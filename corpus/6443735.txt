        The present work was carried out to see the effect of blending of corn grit (CG) with varying levels of chickpea grit (CP 0&#x2013;100%) and spinach leaf powder (SP 0&#x2013;6%) on the characteristics [color, expansion, density, hardness, water absorption index, total phenolic content (TPC), antioxidant activity (AOA; as DPPH and ABTS free radical scavenging activities)] and sensory properties of extrudates. CP and SP were rich in proteins and minerals (Cu, Fe, Zn, Mg, Ca, K and Na). Their blending significantly influenced the physicochemical and antioxidant properties of CG extrudates. TPC and AOA of extrudates increased with the increased incorporation of CP and SP, though specific mechanical energy and extrudate expansion, generally, decreased while density and hardness increased. Sensory analysis revealed that CP and SP at incorporation levels of 25% and 4%, respectively could be blended with CG for making highly acceptable antioxidant-rich expanded snack.
