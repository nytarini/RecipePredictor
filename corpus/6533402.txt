igh-value dairy products has increased
to meet the demand for biofunctional food products, driven by the increasing
interest of consumers in their health and well-being (Swensson et al., 2017). Many biotech companies have developed
new dairy products as functional foods with additional biofunctional activity for
human health as well as acceptability to consumers.
      Oxidative stress in the human body can result from several types of reactive oxygen
species (ROS), which are continuously produced as byproducts of aerobic metabolism
(Biller and Takahashi, 2018; Bury et al., 2018). Some species of reactive
oxygen are highly toxic, causing various diseases, and must be rapidly detoxified by
antioxidants through various cellular mechanisms (Apel and Hirt, 2004; Eom et al.,
2018).
      The health benefits of dairy products have been known for a long time. In particular,
many studies have revealed that cheese has antioxidant effects because it contains
polyphenolic compounds (Branciari et al.,
2015; Hilario et al., 2010). Some
researchers have reported that the antioxidant effects that benefit health are due
to the complexation between the phenolics and milk proteins (Park et al., 2018). However, this antioxidant activity is
relatively weak due to low concentrations of polyphenolic compounds in cheese
products.
      Many researchers have studied the diversification of cheese products by adding
various ingredients including herbs to increase biofunctionality (Lee et al., 2016). However, there is still no
research on the effects of ginseng extract-supplemented quark cheese as a new cheese
product.
      In particular, quark cheese is a type of fresh dairy product manufactured by warming
of soured milk until curdling, without aging. It is classified as fresh acid-set
cheese and has a relatively soft texture. Traditionally, quark is processed as a
dairy food in Northern European countries. Although quark cheese was originally
manufactured without any protease, producers recently began adding small amounts of
rennet. Many investigators have studied the physiochemical properties of quark
cheese during its processing (Ferreiro et al.,
2016).
      Ginseng is a traditional medicinal plant used in Northeast Asian countries,
particularly in Korea. Ginseng root extracts contain saponin, which is the major
active ingredient and is known to have therapeutic activities against various
diseases such as cancer, hypertension, and diabetes or to improve weak health (Jung and Jin, 1996). Many studies have reported
the effects of red ginseng extract on cheese products such as camembert cheese
(Choi et al., 2015; Lee and Bae, 2018), but the application of ginseng extract to
quark cheese remains unclear.
      Therefore, the aim of this study was to evaluate the physiochemical properties,
changes in color and texture, sensory properties, and antioxidant effects of quark
cheese supplemented with ginseng extract in vitro, as compared with
regular quark cheese (control). Our hypothesis was that quark cheese with the added
ginseng extract would have higher antioxidant concentrations as compared to
controls. The results of this study can be practically applied by
biofunctional-dairy-food manufacturers to help maintain public health.

      Materials and Methods

        Materials
        Ginseng extract was obtained from Hwain Korea Co. (Seoul, Korea). The commercial
starter was purchased from the New England Cheese-making Supply Co. (South
Deerfield, MA, USA), whereas Man-Rogosa-Sharpe (MRS) agar was obtained from
Difco Laboratories (Detroit, MI, USA).

        Preparation of quark cheese
        To prepare quark cheese supplemented with the ginseng extract, 5 L of pasteurized
milk (Pasteur Milk Co., Ltd., Seoul, Korea) was supplemented with different
concentrations of the ginseng extract (0%, 0.1%, 0.5%, or
1%). The commercial starter (Streptococcus lactis and
S. cremoris) was inoculated at 0.002% (w/v) into
milk samples mixed with the ginseng extract, and the mixture was incubated in a
cheese vat (Sunil Instrument Co., Daejeon, Korea) at 35&#xB0;C for 220 min.
After cultivation, rennet was added (0.2 mL/L), and the mixture was allowed to
stand at 4&#xB0;C for 19 h for coagulation. The curds were packaged into sacks
and allowed to stand for 18 h to drain out the remaining whey.

        Enumeration of microbial cells
        Samples from every stage of the cheese making process (inoculation, fermentation,
cooling, and storage) were collected, and microbial growth was measured by the
standard plate-counting method on MRS agar plates.

        Physicochemical analysis
        During fermentation, pH was determined with a pH meter (Inolab pH 720, Weihein,
Germany). Proximate analyses of the contents of moisture, crude fat, protein,
and lactose were performed by AOAC methods. The total solids, protein, fat, and
ash contents were measured according to the methods of AOAC International (2000).

        Antioxidant activity
        Each cheese sample was added to twice its volume of methanol (cheese:methanol
ratio of 1:2) and kept for 1 h at 30&#xB0; in a shaking incubator (SI-900R,
Jeio Tech, Kimpo, Korea), centrifuged at 1,900&#xD7;g for 10 min (Combi-514R,
Hanil Co., Ltd., Seoul, Korea), and passed through Whatman No. 2 filter paper.
The filtrates were used as samples for the analysis of antioxidant activity.
        Radical-scavenging activity was determined by a
2,2&#x2032;-azino-bis-3-ethylbenzothiazoline-6-sulphonic acid (ABTS; Sigma, St.
Louis, MO, USA) assay. We mixed 14 mM ABTS and 5 mM potassium persulfate in 0.1
M potassium phosphate buffer (pH 7.4) in a 1:1 ratio and incubated them for 16 h
in a dark room at 25&#xB0;C. The mixture was diluted with 0.1 M potassium
phosphate buffer (pH 7.4) until the absorbance at 734 nm wavelength reached
0.7&#xB1;0.02 on a spectrophotometer (X-ma 3200, Human Co., Ltd., Seoul,
Korea). A 20 &#x3BC;L sample was then added to 980 &#x3BC;L of the above
solution, and the mixture was incubated for 5 min in 37&#xB0;C. Absorbance was
measured at 734 nm. The antioxidant activity was calculated as follows:

        Textural and color analysis
        Texture profile analysis was performed using a TA-XT2 texture analyzer (Texture
Technologies, Surrey, UK). Quark cheeses were prepared in a cube shape
(30&#xD7;30&#xD7;30 mm) and tempered at 10&#xB0;C. The textural analysis
was carried out at room temperature. The data acquisition rate was 200 pps. The
force threshold and contact force were 10 and 5 g, respectively, and the samples
were compressed to 50% of their height. The P75 probe was employed, and
the speed of the probe was 2.5 mm/s during the analysis. In terms of color, L*,
a*, and b* values of each sample were determined with a chroma meter (CR-400
head, Konica Minolta, Tokyo, Japan).

        Sensory analysis
        Consumer sensory analysis was performed by 22 panelists (12 females, 10 males,
age 26&#x2013;30 years) who were screened according to accepted international
standards (ISO 13299:2003). Quantitative descriptive analysis was performed to
evaluate the differences in the sensory characteristics among
ginseng-supplemented quark cheese samples (Ng et
al., 2012). A continuous scale from 0 to 8 was used to measure the
following characteristics: creamy odor, acid odor, ginseng odor, acid taste,
bitter taste, aftertaste, and overall quality. Water and plain bread were
provided between samples as a palette cleanser and quark cheese without the
ginseng extract served as the reference standard.

        Statistical analysis
        The data were expressed as a mean&#xB1;SD. For statistical comparisons, the
results were subjected to one-way analysis of variance (at p&lt;0.05) and
Duncan&#x2019;s multiple-range test in IBM SPSS 22 software (IBM, Armonk, NY,
USA).

      Results and Discussion

        Physicochemical analysis
        The composition of cheese samples supplemented with different concentrations
(0.1%, 0.5%, or 1.0%) of the ginseng extract is presented
in Table 1. The concentration of solids
in the ginseng extract was 61%&#xB1;1.0% (w/v). The moisture
content of ginseng extract-supplemented quark cheese was significantly lower
than that of the control. Lee et al.
(2016) reported that this effect might be due to the influence of
ginseng extract on the water-holding capacity of cheese. The ginseng extract,
like Inula britannica extract, seemed to facilitate contraction
of the cheese matrix by binding particles together and via expulsion of whey,
thereby lowering the amount of entrapped water in the protein network. In
addition, fat and protein contents were significantly increased by the addition
of the ginseng extract. As for lactose and ash contents, these were not affected
significantly by the addition of the ginseng extract at a concentration of less
than 1.0% (p&gt;0.05).

        The ginseng extract did not significantly influence microbial counts of quark
cheese (p&gt;0.05). Kim et al. (2008)
also reported that the addition of red ginseng extract to yogurt does not change
lactic acid bacteria counts in the yogurt. At a concentration of less than
1.0%, the added glycoside-rich ginseng extract seemed to have no
advantageous effects on the growth of lactic acid bacteria in our study.
        In terms of the color parameters at different concentrations (0.1%,
0.5%, and 1.0%) of the ginseng extract in quark samples, L* values
decreased significantly with the increasing concentration of the ginseng
extract, while a* values significantly increased (p&lt;0.05). b* values also
increased with the increasing concentration of the ginseng extract. In this
study, the dark brown color of the ginseng extract itself might have affected
the color of the final quark cheese product. These results are supported by the
study by Kim et al. (2008), who
demonstrated that the addition of red ginseng extract to yogurt decreases L*
values but increases b* values.
        Changes in the texture profile of ginseng extract-supplemented quark cheese were
assessed too. Regarding hardness, all the samples showed an increase with the
increasing concentration of the ginseng extract (0.1% to 1.0%;
p&lt;0.05). This phenomenon may be due to the lower moisture content of
ginseng extract-supplemented cheese. In all the samples, cohesiveness and
springiness were measured and were found to range from 0.73 to 0.80 and from
0.35 to 0.41, respectively. However, the differences were not significant
(p&gt;0.05). Gumminess and chewiness significantly increased with the
increasing concentration of ginseng extract. These results can be explained by
the high hygroscopicity of ginseng extract. Song
et al. (2007) reported that ginseng extract has high water-absorbing
capacity and causes weakness of the dough of white bread.

        Antioxidant activity
        The ABTS assay is a standard method for measuring antioxidant activities (Yang et al., 2019). The radical of
2,2&#x2032;-azino-bis-(3-ethylbenzothiazoline-6-sulfonic acid), i.e.,
ABTS&#xB7;+, is produced via oxidation of ABTS by
potassium persulfate. The mechanism of this assay is reduction of
ABTS&#xB7;+ in the presence of an antioxidant (Re et al., 1999). Some researchers have
found that ginseng contains various antioxidant compounds (Chung et al., 2017). Fig.
1 depicts the results of ABTS radical-scavenging assays of ginseng
extract-supplemented quark cheese. Increasing concentration of the ginseng
extract caused a concomitant increase in the ABTS radical-scavenging activity
(r=0.803, p&lt;0.01). The ABTS radical-scavenging activities of the
cheeses fortified with 0%, 0.5%, or 1.0% of the ginseng
extract were 4.22%&#xB1;0.12%,
20.14%&#xB1;1.34%, and 56.32%&#xB1;1.54%,
respectively. This effect may be due to polyphenolic compounds such as
flavonoids as well as various ginsenosides found in the ginseng extract (Chen et al., 2009; Jung et al., 2016; Ramesh
et al., 2012).

          Fig. 1.

        Sensory evaluation
        The sensory attributes of quark cheese supplemented with different concentrations
(0.1%, 0.5%, or 1.0%) of the ginseng extract are presented
in Fig. 2. The ginseng flavor and taste
increased significantly with the increasing concentration of the ginseng extract
in quark cheese (p&lt;0.05). Flavor properties such as bitterness and
ginseng odor significantly increased with the increasing concentration of the
ginseng extract (p&lt;0.05). In addition, the score of the aftertaste
increased with the concentration of the ginseng extract. In terms of total
quality, there was no significant difference between the no-supplement control
and the samples with less than 0.5% of added ginseng extract in quark
cheese (p&gt;0.05). Many researchers have noted that the addition of ginseng
extract to other food products generally has negative sensory scores, despite
the biofunctional activities of this ingredient toward human health (Lee et al., 2008; Lee et al., 2011). In contrast, our study revealed that the
addition of the ginseng extract at a concentration of less than 0.5% did
not significantly affect the total quality score.

reference standard.

      Conclusion
      This study was designed to develop ginseng extract-supplemented quark cheese and to
evaluate its antioxidant effects (as possible benefits for human health),
physicochemical changes (including color and texture), and sensory properties, as
compared to a no-supplement control. The data on lactic acid bacterial counts,
color, texture, and sensory evaluation from this study indicate that ginseng extract
concentrations of 0.5% could be applicable to the development of quark cheese
with biofunctional activities, such as antioxidant effects. It is known that ginseng
extract contains various ginsenosides with biofunctional properties toward human
health. In addition, some adult diseases are caused by oxidative stress in the human
body. Therefore, ginseng extract-supplemented cheese products may help to maintain
human health and prevent such diseases. Furthermore, the production of quark cheese
that contains ginseng extract may broaden the applications of ginseng and increase
the demand for cheese products.
