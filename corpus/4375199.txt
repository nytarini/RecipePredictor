        Effect of salt substitution (Treat I) and added pea hull flour (PHF) at 8 (Treat-II), 10 (Treat-III) and 12&#xA0;% (Treat-IV) levels on the quality of low fat chicken nuggets (Control) was investigated. Replacement of NaCl significantly affected (P&#x2009;&lt;&#x2009;0.05) emulsion and product pH, emulsion stability, cooking yield, ash content while PHF had additional effect on moisture and protein. Dietary fibre content in the product significantly (P&#x2009;&lt;&#x2009;0.05) increased at each level of PHF. The colour parameters remained similar to control due to salt replacement while added PHF decreased their values. Textural properties were lower (P&#x2009;&lt;&#x2009;0.05) in the treated products. Addition of PHF significantly (P&#x2009;&lt;&#x2009;0.05) decreased cholesterol and glycolipids contents at 8&#xA0;% and 12&#xA0;% levels, respectively. Sensory evaluation exhibited that 40&#xA0;% NaCl can efficiently be replaced and 8&#xA0;% PHF can be incorporated as a source of fibre in low fat chicken nuggets without significant effect on various attributes.
