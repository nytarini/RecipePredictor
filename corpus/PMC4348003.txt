   With vast improvements in newborn screening techniques (1) and heightened clinical awareness from general practitioners, Cystic Fibrosis (CF) is frequently diagnosed very early in life, prior to the onset of pulmonary symptoms (2). As several longitudinal studies have linked early nutritional status to improved pulmonary function and respiratory symptoms later in childhood (3, 4), aggressive recommendations have been made to optimize nutritional status immediately after diagnosis. In a 2008 report (5), the Cystic Fibrosis Foundation's (CFF) Subcommittee on Growth and Nutrition released their recommendation that infants and toddlers diagnosed early with CF attain weight-for-length (WFL) status of ≥50th percentile, based on the Center for Disease Control (CDC) growth references, by age two. Subsequent studies have shown that children who maintain above average growth in early childhood are more likely to have normal lung function into adulthood and have a survival advantage over those that are in lower growth percentiles (5)1. In this issue of JPGN, Evans et al (7) present the first analysis examining pulmonary function outcomes based on anthropometric measurements from early childhood using the World Health Organization (WHO) growth standards. This study assesses whether CDC-based growth recommendations can be directly applied to patients measured using WHO standards and begins an important discussion on how best to measure growth and nutritional status in children with CF.

Since their release in 2006, WHO growth standards have been widely adopted for assessment of growth in pediatric clinics worldwide. Owed to their rigorous methodological development in a sampling of predominantly breastfed infants across 6 countries (Norway, India, Ghana, Oman, Brazil and the US) (8), the CDC recommends use of the WHO growth standards for plotting anthropometric weight and length measurements in US children between birth and age two. However, the transition to following growth of children with CF on the WHO growth curves is not trivial. While the CDC and WHO growth curves follow similar patterns for the first six months of age, the rate of rise in weight-for-age is steeper on the CDC curves from age six months through two years. Via review of CFF registry data, Evans et al showed that WFL measurements at age two were significantly higher based on WHO curves (median 65th percentile versus 48th on CDC curves). Further, almost half (43%) who were in the 10th-50th percentile WFL on the CDC growth charts were ≥50th percentile using WHO standards. This finding presents important implications for infants and toddlers with CF, most of whom, along with their parents, fight daily battles to take pancreatic replacement enzymes and a variety of nutritional supplements in order to meet guidelines for growth. Children with CF struggle with multiple barriers to digestion and absorption of nutrients beyond pancreatic insufficiency, which coupled with increased metabolic demands, often lead to gastrostomy tube placement for nutritional supplementation (9). If pulmonary outcomes for those reaching 50th percentile WFL on the WHO curves alone were equivalent to those reaching 50th percentile on the CDC curves, it would allow for more modest caloric intake and growth goals, a likely welcome change for patients and families.

However, data presented by Evans et al show that pulmonary function, based on FEV1% predicted at age 6, was significantly better in those attaining 50th percentile WFL at age two on both the WHO and CDC curves, versus those that met 50th percentile on the WHO curve alone. Though the difference between the two groups was modest clinically (median FEV1% predicted differed by only 4 points between the two groups), the difference in pulmonary function and overall respiratory status may become more pronounced later in childhood and into early adulthood. It will be key to pursue further longitudinal studies to better understand whether growth recommendations using the WHO standards may need to be increased to confer the same longer-term benefits that are seen with CDC-based growth recommendations. Further, there are interesting theoretical implications to the Evans et al finding that maintenance of weight ≥50th percentile, on both CDC and WHO curves, between ages two and 6 years, correlated with improved pulmonary function. While better nutritional status and growth early in life are associated with better pulmonary function and outcomes later in life, the nature of the relationship is not well explained.

Over the past 20 years, significant improvements in the medical management of pulmonary manifestations of CF have led to overall improvements in lung function in childhood (10)10. However, the maintenance of adequate nutritional status has continued to be a struggle for CF patients and has lasting consequences for their overall health. Longitudinal outcomes data based on growth status early in childhood can be used to give patients, families and providers important goals for nutritional supplementation. Novel treatments such as those that potentiate defective CFTR channels are already helping patients with CFTR gating mutations, improving lung function and also leading to more robust nutritional status (11). However, until similar treatments have been developed for CF patients with non-gating CFTR mutations, who are the vast majority, it will be important to continue to refine and publicize nutritional recommendations that are easily interpretable for families and practitioners and can be clearly linked to improved pulmonary function and extended expected survival rates. The WHO growth standards are now the recommended tool for tracking anthropometric growth in children from birth to age two—therefore, it is necessary to establish how early growth on WHO growth charts correlates with pulmonary function and survival into adulthood.
