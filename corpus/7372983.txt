nd is one of the main factors that drive
consumer accept foods (Maughan et al., 2012).
Meat flavor is created by components that are derived from either lean or fat
tissues and can be divided into two categories - the general meat flavor of all
animal species and the specific flavor of beef, pork, lamb or other species (Myers et al., 2009). Species-specific flavors
have been traditionally associated with many factors, such as fat, fat-soluble
volatile compounds, and phospholipids (Melton,
1999). And those specific flavors vary in meats from different animal
species (Rhee et al., 2005).
      Donkey is one of the most important domestic animals and plays a vital role in
transporting people and goods across the old world. Today, in many countries,
donkeys are multi-purpose, as they not only provide transport, but also milk, blood
and meat (Camillo et al., 2018). In China,
donkey skin is applied as traditional medicine (Colla Corii Asini)
to treat anemia (Shi et al., 2011). Donkey
meat has recently been recognized as nutritive food for human consumption with good
quality proteins, vitamins, and minerals (Lorenzo et
al., 2014). Moreover, the leaner meat, with less fat and consistent
quality is favored by current consumers, and thus donkey meat is mainly produced by
young animals to avoid undesirable characteristics such as the lack of tenderness
(Polidori and Vincenzetti, 2013).
However, the consumption of donkey meat in the world is very scarce and limited to
some countries, such as China, Spain, Bulgaria, Italy, and several countries in
Africa (Aganga et al., 2003; Camillo et al., 2018). Several reports mentioned
that meat of some other animal species such as buffalo and goat, with favorable
nutritional profile, similar as meat products from donkey can be an alternative in
the beef and pork markets (Madruga and Bressan,
2011; Marino et al., 2015; Paleari et al., 2003). Previous study have
shown that taste nucleotides, taste activity value (TAV), and the flavor content and
amino acids in donkey neck meat were higher than any other part of that animal such
as lame, ribs and ridge meats (Li et al.,
2019). In order to provide new insights into donkey neck meat flavor
components and predict its more possible consumption, the present work was carried
out to evaluate the flavor substances in neck meat of four different animals
(donkey, swine, bovine, and sheep) and try to find out the main causes of these
flavor differences.

      Materials and Methods

        Sample collection
        Donkey meats (Xiaohei Donkey, 2-year-old, male) were obtained from Shandong
Dong-E-E-Jiao Co. Ltd. (Shandong, China). The bovine (Charolais, 2-year-old,
male), swine (Large White pig, 6-month-old, male) and sheep (Charolais sheep,
1-year-old, male) neck meats were provided and appraised by School of Food
Science and Technology, Jiangnan University. All the muscles of the pectoral
girdle were picked, aseptically trimmed, and divided to experiment immediately
after post mortem.

        Chemical analysis

          Volatile compound profiling by electronic nose
          For the detection of volatile compounds, each sample (5.0 g) with five
replicates were weighed, sealed, and placed in a constant temperature water
bath at 80&#xB0;C for 30 min. After cooling to room temperature
(20&#xB0;C), the volatile compound analysis was performed on a fast gas
phase electronic nose (model Heracles II made by Scientific System, Inc.
SSI) with 2 hydrogen flame (FID) detector and an autosampler. The samples
were double-column synchronous analysis with a non-polar column DB-5-FID1
and a polar column DB-1701-FID2 (2 m&#xD7;1 mm). The analytical condition
was as follows: program temperature 10&#xB0;C/s, injection speed 125
&#x3BC;L/s, injection time held continuously at 13s with temperature
200&#xB0;C; injection volume 2,000 &#x3BC;L; an initial temperature of
search trap was 50&#xB0;C, temperature of detector was 260&#xB0;C.

          SPME-GC&#x2013;MS analysis
          The meat samples were preheated as the above mentioned in electronic nose
analysis. The headspace solid phase extraction conditions were as follows:
extraction head model 50/30 &#x3BC;m DVB/CAR/PDMS; 250&#xB0;C, 30 min
aging, then extraction head was placed in 80&#xB0;C heating tray, constant
temperature headspace extraction for 50 min. After extraction, the needle
was pulled out and inserted into the GC inlet immediately, and the test was
completed in 2 minutes. GC-MS was analyzed on a DB-5 capillary column
(Agilent J &amp; W GC, 30 m&#xD7;0.25 mm&#xD7;0.25 &#x3BC;m) with
high purity helium at 1.0 mL/min flow rate. The inlet temperature was
250&#xB0;C. The GC-MS analysis methods as follows: set initial temperature
at 40&#xB0;C, held for 3 min, then increased to 240&#xB0;C at a rate of
10&#xB0;C/min, held for 5 min. The transfer line temperature was kept at
240&#xB0;C, and the ion source temperature was 240&#xB0;C. The detector
operated in scan mode from 35 to 500 m/z with an ionization voltage of 70
eV.

          Fatty acid composition analysis
          Lipids were extracted from the meat as described by Gao and Zhang (2010). For the fatty acid composition
analysis after saponification and methyl esterification, the lipid sample
(750 &#x3BC;L) was dissolved in 2% sodium hydroxide methanol
solution (8 mL), the sample was heated at 80&#xB0;C, and 15% boron
trifluoride methanol (7 mL) was added, then cooled to room temperature. The
fatty acids methyl esters were extracted with normal heptane and 1 &#x3BC;L
was injected into a gas chromatograph. Chromatographic conditions: Supelco
SP-2560 vapor phase capillary column (30 m&#xD7;0.25 mm&#xD7;0.2
&#x3BC;m, 100% dicyanopropyl polysiloxane as a stationary phase);
helium was used as the carrier gas; 1.0 mL/min constant flow; the column
temperature was held at 140&#xB0;C for 5 min, and then increased with
speed of 4&#xB0;C/min up to 200&#xB0;C and held for 1 min, then
increased with speed of 3&#xB0;C/min from 200&#xB0;C to 220&#xB0;C and
hold for 26 min; final inlet temperature was 230&#xB0;C.

          Free amino acids analysis
          For the free amino acid determination, 5.0 g sample was homogenized and
filtered by 0.45 &#x3BC;m microporous membrane, as described by previous
report (Kobayashi et al., 2016). An
amino acid analyzer was used to amino acid determination. The analytical
conditions were: Na-type ion exchange column (4.6 mm&#xD7;60 nm, 3 um)
with lithium salt buffer as the eluent; two-channel detection, at the flow
rate of 0.35 mL/min, with a detection wavelength was 420 and 570 nm,
respectively; column temperature was 57&#xB0;C, post-column
derivatization, the derivatizing agent was ninhydrin buffer and the reaction
temperature was 135&#xB0;C.

          Taste nucleotides analysis
          Nucleotides were extracted and analyzed as described by Dai et al. (2011) with little modification. Meat samples
(5.0 g) were homogenized with pre-cooled 5% perchlorate (15 mL), then
centrifuged at 10,000&#xD7;g for 5 min. The supernatant was transferred to
a 100 mL beaker, 15 mL of pre-cooled 5% perchloric acid was added,
shaken, and the supernatant was centrifuged and mixed again, and the above
operation was repeated twice. The pH of the supernatant was adjusted to 6.5,
and ultrapure water was adjusted to 50 mL volumetric flask. The liquid phase
filtered prior to high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) injection.
The HPLC system consisted of a SPD-20A UV detector and a Galaksil EF-C18Bio
column (5&#xD7;250 mm). The mobile phases were A: 0.05 M
NaH2PO4/H2O, B: methanol. The gradient
was A: B (100:0 for 0&#x2013;6 min, 100:95 for 6&#x2013;7 min, 100:95 for
7&#x2013;16 min, 0:100 for 16&#x2013;30 min). Nucleotides of standard
substance and samples were detected at 260nm and flow rate was 1.5 mL/min.
Each nucleotide was identified with 37 Component FAME Mix standard substance
which was purchased from sigma.
          Weighing standard product dissolved in ultra pure water to prepare 1,000
&#x3BC;mol/L mother liquor, then diluted to 100, 40, 20, 10, 5
&#x3BC;mol/L, the injection volume was 20 &#x3BC;L. Nucleotide
identification was made by comparing the retention time of the solution in
the standard. The peak area was taken as the abscissa, and the concentration
of each standard was the ordinate, and a standard curve was drawn. The HPLC
chromatogram of the mixed standard solution is seen in LI (Li et al., 2019). The peak order and
retention time of each individual standard in the meat samples were:
guanylate (GMP): 4.939 min; muscle glycosylate (IMP): 5.344 min;
hypoxanthine (Hx): 6.513 min; adenylate (AMP): 8.804 min; inosine (HxR):
15.579 min. The gradient concentration of the nucleotide standard was
analyzed, and the standard curve for establishing five nucleotides was as
shown in follow: GMP: Y=1,2636x+4,211.5,
R2=0.9999; IMP: Y=8,147.3x&#x2013;4,717.9,
R2=0.9999; Hx: Y=9,825.1x+ 3,1443,
R2=0.9958; AMP: Y=1,5176x&#x2013;3,953.7,
R2=0.9999; HxR: Y=8,825.4x+2,353.6,
R2=0.9999.
          Estimation formula of umami nucleotide content as followed:
X=C&#xD7;V&#xD7;m (Wen and Wu,
2010), and a general linear models (GLM) procedure was also used.
X: target substance content (mg/100 g); C: concentration of target substance
(mg/mL); V: sample&#x2019;s volume (mL); m: weight (g).
          Taste activity value (TAV) = C/T (Chen
and Zhang, 2007a). C: weight; T: odour threshold.

        Statistical analysis
        Data was analyzed using SPSS software, version 20.0 (IBM-SPSS, Chicago, IL, USA).
One-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) was used to determine significant
differences between means, with the significance level taken at
p&lt;0.05.

      Results and Discussion

        Flavor compounds
        Flavor volatile components of different animals&#x2019; neck meat was assessed by
Heracles II fast gas phase electronic nose. Furthermore, the principal component
analysis (PCA) was performed with flavor compounds in different samples; so as
to linearly convert the raw data vector of the sample, and change the coordinate
axis to achieve the purpose of distinguishing the sample. Possible flavor
differences among the samples of neck meat were analyzed according to the
retention index designation library (Fig.
1). It was reported that the unidirectional distance of the sample in the
horizontal and vertical coordinates in PCA plot represented the difference
between the samples. Indeed, if the lateral distance of the two samples is
larger, it indicates that there is a large difference between the samples, and
vice versa; since the longitudinal distance has a small contribution rate
between samples, the influence on the difference between samples was also small
(Huang et al., 2018; Tian and Sun, 2008), and more than
70% to 85% of the overall contribution rate can be tested
experimentally. It can be seen that principal component 1 (PC1) contributed to
96.19% of the data variability while principal component 2 (PC2)
contributed to the 3.32% of the variability. And these two principal
components explained 99.51% of the variability. Therefore, most of the
valid information of representative samples can be compared (Xin et al., 2014), and the quadrilateral
regions where the four samples are located do not overlap each other, indicating
that the electronic nose can effectively distinguish the flavor differences
between the four different meat necks. It can be obviously seen that PC1 is the
main flavor difference component, which has a great influence on the overall
flavor. The distance between the neck meat of donkey and bovine is larger, that
is, the difference between PC1 is larger, and the difference between the neck
meat of donkey and swine is smaller in the abscissa, indicating that the PC1 has
less difference. The difference in ordinate distance is large, but because of
its small contribution rate, the overall flavor difference between the neck
meats of donkey and swine is small. Thus, in general, the difference in flavor
between the neck of donkey, bovine and sheep is more significant, and slightly
lower difference in flavor between the neck meat obtained from donkey and
swine.

        It was shown in Fig. 2 that the number 1
indicated the retention time under the DB-5-FID1 column and the number 2
indicated the retention time of the DB-1701-FID2 column. Comparing the
chromatograms of two different polar columns, the flavor components shown the
difference initially identified, with the retention time on 15.04-1-A and
16.88-2-A, 16.20-1-A and 19.59-2-A, 17.30-1-A and 21.04-2-A, 18.44-1-A and
23.92-2-A, 26.54-1-A and 33.40-2-A. Different flavor components were listed in
Table 1, and the aldehydes were in
the highest amount. The GC&#x2013;MS analysis (Fig. 3) was applied on verifying the results in the electronic nose
analysis and analyzing the composition of the volatile components and the
results were shown in Table 2, Table S1,
Table S2 and Table S3. A total number of 73 compounds were identified in four
samples. Among them, 25 volatiles [n-hexanal (0.52 mg, 46.85%), heptanal
(0.07 mg, 6.31%) and octanal (0.07 mg, 6.31%)] were detected in
donkey neck meat; 40 volatiles in swine neck meat, mainly including n-hexanal
(1.79 mg, 38.74%), nonanal (0.50 mg, 10.82%), and n-caproic acid
vinyl ester (0.35 mg, 7.58%); 42 volatiles were detected in the neck of
sheep, mainly including hexanal (0.96 mg, 24.12%), nonanal (0.70 mg,
17.59%) and 2,3-octanedione (0.26 mg, 6.53%); and 33 volatiles in
bovine neck meat, mainly including n-hexanal (1.69 mg, 28.89%), nonanal
(0.90 mg, 15.38%) and octanal (0.43 mg, 7.35%). Previous work on
meat flavor (Xie et al., 2008; Zhao et al., 2017) corroborated with these
results that the aldehydes accounted for the largest (Table 3), followed by the alcohols and hydrocarbons;
considered as the key volatile flavor compounds in neck meats. The result was
consistent with the possible flavor differences in Table 1. Among the aldehydes, n- hexanal is the most
volatile flavor in the neck of the four neck meats, known for its clear
fragrance of grass, mainly derived from the oxidative decomposition of oleic
acid, linoleic acid and arachidonic acid. Alcohols is the second largest flavor
compounds in donkey neck meat, and the alcohols is mainly produced from the
automatic oxidation of fat in the meat. The majority of those alcohols is
1-octene-3-ol which belongs to the unsaturated alcohols and the nature of low
odor thresholds. Thus, it could be easily detected and contributed a lot to the
oil odor of the donkey neck meat. The different content of hydrocarbon compounds
in the donkey and other animal&#x2019;s neck meat inevitably led to their
different aroma profiles. Hydrocarbons are common volatile components, but with
a higher aromatic threshold or even no odor, they have little contribution to
flavor. In agreement with the electronic nose PCA analysis results and compared
with the swine neck meat, donkey neck meat has analogous amount of alcohols,
though slightly higher number of aldehydes, and less flavor contribution from
hydrocarbon; it can be seen that the flavors of swine and donkey neck meat are
similar.

        Fatty acid profile
        Fatty acid composition profile of donkey and three other animals&#x2019; neck
meat was shown in Table 4. Donkey neck
meat appeared to have the highest level (39.00%) of oleic acid; followed
by palmitic acid (25.32%) slightly higher than the other three samples.
Linoleic acid accounted for 15.83% in donkey neck meats, significantly
higher than bovine and sheep and slightly higher than swine ones. It appeared
that the fatty acids in donkey neck meats were mainly unsaturated fatty acids,
accounting for 63.18%. The oxidation of enzymes in fat oxidation is the
primary oxidation reaction of unsaturated fatty acids under the catalysis of
lipoxygenase. The primary hydroperoxides form secondary oxidation products by
homogenization or &#x3B2; fission decomposition, such as aldehydes and ketones
make great contribution to meat flavor (Chen and
Zhang, 2007). Oleic acid and linoleic acid are the two most abundant
unsaturated fatty acids in the donkey neck meats, two sums for 54.83% and
higher than those of thee others. The n-hexanal and other aldehydes detected in
this experiment, such as heptanal and non-aldehyde were the main volatile
oxidation products of unsaturated fatty acids. N-hexanal was considered to have
unpleasant rancidity and grass odor (Kobayashi
et al., 2016), mainly from oleic acid, linoleic acid and arachidonic
acid oxidation. The decomposition of hydroperoxide produced in the process was
consistent with the high content of unsaturated fatty acids in the donkey neck
meat. Heptanal has odors with salty taste, barbecued fat, oily aroma and citrus
aroma (Huang et al., 2018), derived from
the oxidative decomposition of linoleic acid. The oxidative decomposition of
arachidonic acid derived from nonaldehyde (Tian
and Sun, 2008) give a strong fat taste and citrus fragrance. The
1-octene-3-ol, a high-content unsaturated alcohol in the donkey neck, is a
product of auto-oxidation of linoleic acid and produce a
&#x201C;mushroom&#x201D; flavor (Luo et al.,
2010).

        Free amino acids
        Free amino acids are great contributors of flavor and taste in meat products by
generating volatile compounds through Maillard reaction and Strecker degradation
(Dashdorj et al., 2015). Furthermore,
amino acids are also the basic substances that constitute the protein needed for
animal nutrition, and participate in many physiological activities of the human
body. The content and taste parameters of free amino acids in the neck meats
were shown in Table 5. The type and
content of amino acids determine the nutritional value of food proteins. As can
be seen from Table 5, the main amino
acids in the donkey neck meats were alanine (Ala), lysine (Lys), glutamic acid
(Glu), glycine (Gly), and serine (Ser). And low-content amino acids were
asparagine (Asp), leucine (Leu), and arginine (Arg). Other less abundant amino
acids were tyrosine (Tyr), proline (Pro), phenylalanine (Phe), valine (Val),
isoleucine (Ile), histidine (His) and threonine (Thr). Among them, 6 kinds of
essential amino acids and 9 of non-essential amino acids were detected. The
concentration of essential amino acids in neck meat samples were
donkey&gt;bovine&gt;swine&gt;sheep (donkey: 42.55 mg/100 g, bovine:
7.37 mg/100 g, swine: 7.13 mg/100 g, sheep: 5.28 mg/100 g), indicating that
donkey neck meat is nutritious and could better provide necessary amino acids
for human consumption which body cannot synthesize. The total amount of amino
acids in donkey neck meats is the highest when compared with three other types
of animals, indicating that the taste of the donkey neck meat may be more
delicious. Among them, the sweet amino acid Ala and the umami amino acid Glu
content in the donkey neck meat are significantly higher than other meats. The
umami taste in meat products mainly depends on the content of umami amino acids.
The composition and concentration of free amino acids such as Asp, Ala, Gly and
other umami amino acids play an important role in enhancing savory or umami
taste. Besides, different amino acid combinations will form different flavors
with characteristic properties (Arnau et al.,
1998; Est&#xE9;vez et al.,
2003). For instance, Gly, Ser, Pro, Thr and Ala for the sweet and
savory taste (Rico et al., 1991); mainly
umami amino acids including Asp and Glu; those containing a sour taste such as
His, Asp, Pro; Arg, Phe, Try, His, Val, Met, Ile, Tyr and Lys has the bitter
taste (Arnau et al., 1998; Rico et al., 1991). As it can be seen from
Table 6 the highest proportion of
amino acids in the donkey neck meats was the sweet amino acid, while the bitter
taste amino acid content in the bovine, swine and sheep neck meat was relatively
high. In all neck meats, the proportion of umami amino acids was relatively low.
In comparison, it was found that the proportion of sweet amino acids in the
donkey neck meats was significantly higher than that in the neck of other meats.
The sum of the sweet and umami amino acids in donkey neck meat was also higher
than that of other meats, especially the sweet amino acid Ala and the umami
amino acid Glu were significantly higher than other animal neck meats,
indicating that the sweet umami amino acid contributed a lot to the overall
taste of donkey neck meats.

        Flavor nucleotides
        Umami taste is described as savory, brothy, or beefy, which is triggered by the
flavor-potentiating compounds, such as 5&#x2019;-inosine monophosphate (IMP) and
5&#x2019;-guanosine monophosphate (GMP) and by the synergism of these
nucleotides with L-glutamate (Dashdorj et al.,
2015). The umami taste of L-glutamate can be significantly enhanced
by 5&#x2019;-ribonucleotides and the synergy is a property of this taste quality
(Zhang et al., 2010). The ATP rapidly
drops within a few hours after slaughter by getting converted into ADP, AMP, and
other derived compounds by the action of several enzymes. Both ADP and AMP act
as intermediate compounds, and then they decrease to negligible values (Batlle et al., 2001. For example, AMP is
deaminated into IMP, and this compound is progressively changed into inosine and
hypoxanthine in the fresh meat within few hours after slaughter depending on
muscle type (Ishiwatari et al., 2013;
Zhang et al., 2010). In this study,
HPLC was used to analyze the contents of five kinds of flavor nucleotides of
guanylate, inosine, hypoxanthine (Hx), adenylate and inosine in the neck of four
kinds of meat (Table 7). As shown in
Table 7, the nucleotides in the neck
of the donkey were mainly IMP and inosine HxR, while the contents of AMP, GMP
and Hx are relatively low. After slaughtering, cooling and maturating, ATP is
decomposed into ADP, AMP, IMP, etc. IMP was the most abundant in samples of
donkey neck meat, indicating that of ATP was rapidly degraded into IMP under the
action of endogenous enzymes. However, due to the very slow degradation of IMP,
that was accumulated (Han et al., 2017),
indeed, the content of IMP was higher than that of other odorants. Therefore,
IMP and AMP are the most important nucleotides for the taste of donkey neck
meat. Studies have shown that there is a synergistic effect between IMP and AMP
in enhancing the umami taste of food (Wu et al.,
2014). Comparing the total amount of taste nucleotides in the neck of
four kinds of meat, it can be found that
swine&gt;donkey&gt;sheep&gt;bovine, indicating that the taste of the
donkey neck meat may be better than samples from sheep and bovine. The content
of IMP and Inosine were higher in both donkey and swine, and the content of IMP
in the donkey neck was higher than that in the swine neck. IMP is a very strong
freshener and is the main flavoring substance. IMP contributes mostly to the
&#x201C;umami&#x201D; taste and has been widely used as a flavor enhancer to
increase palatability (Dashdorj et al.,
2015). It can be inferred that the taste of the donkey neck meat is
superior to other neck meats. GMP and IMP are the most representative umami
nucleotides (Mau et al., 1997). Their
flavor thresholds are 12.50 mg/100 g and 25.00 mg/100 g, respectively, by
calculating the neck meat of donkey, swine, bovine, and sheep. The TAV was used
to determine the degree of influence of flavor nucleotides on the taste of the
meat. The results were shown in Table 8.
A TAV value greater than 1, indicating that the taste of the nucleotide can be
perceived by people taste, and a TAV value of less than 1 cannot be perceived.
Table 8 showed that the TAV values of
GMP in the neck of the four meats were all below 1, indicating that AMP has no
significant contribution to the sweetness characteristics of the neck&#x2019;s
meats. The TAV value of IMP in the donkey and swine was greater than 1,
indicating that IMP has a significant contribution to the umami characteristics
of the donkey neck and swine neck. In donkey neck meat, ATP is rapidly degraded
to IMP under the action of endogenous enzymes, but IMP degradation is very slow,
IMP is mainly accumulated in animals (Xin et
al., 2014) so the content of IMP is higher than other related
substances. IMP is the main flavor nucleotide of donkey and swine neck meat,
while the IMP in bovine and sheep neck meat had a TAV value of &lt;1, which
is not the main flavor nucleotide.

        The simultaneous presence of taste amino acids and taste nucleotides can produce
a synergistic effect and significantly improve the umami taste of meat foods. In
terms of taste amino acids, the sum of the specific gravity of sweet and umami
amino acids in donkey neck meat were higher than that of other animal neck
meats. The content of sweet amino acid Ala and umami amino acid Glu are
prominent, that is, compared with the neck meat of other samples, the taste of
the donkey neck meat was more sweet; in terms of taste nucleotides, the TAV
value of IMP is donkey meat&gt;swine&gt;sheep&gt;bovine studied have
shown that Glu and Ala can synergize with IMP to enhance the umami taste, and
the presence of IMP can also enhance the sweetness intensity of sweet amino
acids. In the end, IMP and the sweet umami amino acid represented by Ala and Glu
were umami substances in the donkey neck meat, and they synergistically
responsible for its more delicious taste. In summary, the donkey neck meat has a
certain degree of nutritional value and significant taste characteristics, which
is an important basis for people to lay their choice on the donkey neck
meat.

      Conclusion
      Our investigation demonstrates that the aldehydes are the main volatile flavors in
the donkey neck meat, and particularly n-hexanal, the most abundant volatile flavor,
is mainly derived from the oxidative decomposition of oleic acid, linoleic acid and
arachidonic acid. The comparison with unsaturated fatty acid in donkey, beef, pork
and lamb neck meat, evidenced that aldehydes in donkey neck meat were more abundant
than other animals due to higher unsaturated fatty acid contained, which
significantly influenced meat flavor. According to the analysis of nonvolatile
flavor substances that confirmed that donkey neck meat possesses unique flavor,
attributed to presence of umami substances such as IMP, Ala and Glu inside.
Therefore, there is significant difference between donkey meat and other meats
(swine, bovine and sheep) in flavor and nutrients contents.
