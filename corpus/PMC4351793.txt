Malnutrition may impact the pharmacokinetics (PK) of antiretroviral medications and virologic responses in HIV-infected children. We therefore evaluated the PK of nevirapine (NVP), efavirenz (EFV) and lopinavir (LPV) in associations with nutritional status in a cohort of HIV-infected Ugandan children.

Methods
Sparse dried blood spot (DBS) samples from Ugandan children were used to estimate plasma concentrations. Historical PK data from children from three resource-rich countries (RRC) were utilized to develop the PK models.

Results
Concentrations in 330 DBS from 163 Ugandan children aged 0.7–7 years were analyzed in reference to plasma PK data (1189 samples) from 204 children from RRC aged 0.5–12 years. Among Ugandan children 48% was malnourished (underweight, thin or stunted). Compared to RRC, Ugandan children exhibited reduced bioavailability of EFV and LPV; 11% (P=0.045) and 18% (P=0.008) respectively. In contrast, NVP bioavailability was 46% higher in Ugandan children (P&lt;0.001) with a trend towards greater bioavailability when malnourished. Children receiving LPV, EFV or NVP had comparable risk of virologic failure. Among children on NVP, low height and weight for age Z-scores were associated with reduced risk of virologic failure (p=0.034, p=0.068 respectively).

Conclusions
Ugandan children demonstrated lower EFV and LPV and higher NVP exposure compared to children in RRC, perhaps reflecting the consequence of malnutrition on bioavailability. In children receiving NVP, the relation between exposure, malnutrition and outcome turned out to be marginally significant. Further investigations are warranted using more intensive PK measurements and adequate adherence assessements, to further assess causes of virologic failure in Ugandan children.


   Background
More than 90% of the world’s 2.3 million HIV-infected children live in sub-Saharan Africa.1 The pharmacokinetics (PK) of antiretroviral medications (ARV) in children in general, and those residing in sub-Saharan Africa specifically, have not been well characterized.2 ARV exposure in these children may be affected by both developmental changes due to growth3 as well as malnutrition;4–6 with the latter far more common in sub-Saharan Africa then in resource-rich countries (RRC).7 Food insecurity, an upstream determinant of malnutrition, can result in decreased adherence to ARV.8,9 This is a more blatant contributor to variability in ARV exposure beyond any potential effects of nutritional status on drug absorption and metabolism. PK variability for ARV has serious implications for clinical outcomes. Erratic exposure to nevirapine (NVP) efavirenz (EFV) or boosted lopinavir (LPV) is associated with increased risks for virologic failure and/or drug resistance10–20 and may elucidate why malnutrition is associated with worsening the clinical course of HIV infection.8,21–25

Previous studies investigating ARV exposures in malnourished children are inconclusive.26–30 Studies suggest that WHO dosing guidelines for ARV based on weight yield suboptimal exposure to ARV in children, specifically for LPV and EFV.31–33 Additionally, early studies report further reduced concentrations of ARV in sub-Saharan children.26–28,30,34 Since it remains unknown why WHO dosing guidelines leads to suboptimal exposures in sub-Saharan children and whether malnutrition alters pediatric ARV exposures, more information is needed. Ultimately this knowledge may help guide optimal ARV treatment in malnourished children. To determine the effects of malnutrition on ARV PK in children, we investigated the PK of NVP, EFV and LPV in a cohort of HIV-infected children with diverse nutritional status residing in Tororo, Uganda. To determine if malnutrition was affecting the PK in Ugandan children, we evaluated levels following treatment in a model developed using datasets from RRC children and determined whether, within this cohort, measures of malnutrition were predictive of PK differences. To also explore the clinical impact of PK variability due to malnutrition, we compared virologic outcomes by treatment arm.

Methods
Sparse DBS samples from EFV, LPV and NVP from Ugandan children were collected. Datasets from the United States, The Netherlands and France, referred from this point forward as “resource-rich countries” (RRC) were utilized to develop a PK model that enables study of the effect of malnutrition on ARV PK of Ugandan children.31,35,36

Study population and sample collection
For this analysis, children were drawn from the “HIV Protease Inhibitors for the Prevention of Malaria in Ugandan Children” trial (PROMOTE-PEDS, NCT00978068, http://clinicaltrials.gov/show/NCT00978068). PROMOTE-PEDS was a prospective randomized clinical trial that enrolled Ugandan children between 2 months and 5 years of age. ARV details and procedures for the clinical study have been described previously.37 Briefly, the purpose of PROMOTE-PEDS was to evaluate differences in malaria and HIV outcomes among children randomized to receive either a non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor-based (NVP or EFV) or HIV protease inhibitor (boosted LPV) based- ARV regimen. Uncomplicated malaria was treated using artemether-lumefantrine, and complicated malaria using quinine. Children who were already receiving ARV were randomly assigned to continue their current regimen or to switch to LPV while continuing the same nucleoside analogue backbone. ARV-naïve children or their mothers who had received any dose of NVP in the past 24 months were excluded. Dosing was performed according to the Working Group on Antiretroviral Therapy and Medical Management of HIV-Infected Children,38 as summarized in Table 1.

Children were followed at the study clinic with monthly routine visits; CD4 counts and percentages, and HIV RNA levels were determined every 12 weeks for the first year and every 24 weeks thereafter as previously described.39 Weight and age were obtained at each sampling time point for all patients Z-scores - calculated using WHO growth standards (2007)40 - lower than −2 was used to classify low weight-for-age (WAZ, underweight), low height-for-age (HAZ, stunting) 41 and low BMI for age (BAZ, thinness).42 Malnutrition was defined as underweight, stunting and/or thinness. 8. Food insecurity was measured using the Household Food Insecurity Access Scale (HFIAS), 43 and household hunger using the Household Hunger Scale (HHS).44 All covariates are listed in Table 1. All parents/guardians of the children provided written informed consent. The study protocol was approved by the Faculty of Medicine’s Research and Ethics Committee at Makerere University, the Uganda National Council of Science and Technology, and the Committee on Human Research at the University of California San Francisco.

Dried blood spots (DBS) for EFV, LPV and NVP measurements were collected during regularly scheduled monthly visits between May and August 2011. As samples were obtained after a minimum of 4 weeks after the start of treatment, all children were expected to have reached steady state ARV at the time of DBS sampling. At each visit, a single DBS was obtained and the time of collection was recorded. DBS were collected using a standardized amount of blood on Whatman™ Classic cards, Whatman™ 903 Cards, or chromatography paper. The samples were stored at −20°C and shipped on dry ice, in zip lock bags with a desiccant packet in each bag and considered stable.45 Time of the last ARV dose was determined per parent/guardian-report. DBS samples from Ugandan children were analyzed for EFV, LPV and NVP using a validated liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry method as described previously with similar assay conditions for NVP; 46 lower limits of quantification (LLOQ) for EFV, LPV and NVP were 0.1 mg/L, 0.01 mg/L and 0.01 mg/L, respectively. DBS concentrations were corrected to estimate the corresponding plasma concentrations as described previously.46

Historical pediatric datasets from RRC and corresponding population PK models
We developed the PK model for EFV using rich sampled data with up to six plasma samples collected over a dosing interval and the corresponding population PK model from a previously published Dutch study evaluating the efficacy and safety of EFV, abacavir, didanosine and lamivudine in children, aged 0.9 to 19 years.31 For our analysis, children &gt;12 years of age were excluded.

The PK model for LPV was developed using a sparse sampled dataset using single plasma samples obtained during routine clinical practice visits and the corresponding population PK model from a French study,36 that included children, aged 0.5 to 7.9 years who were receiving LPV for the treatment of HIV infection or the prevention of mother-to-child transmission and underwent therapeutic drug monitoring for LPV concentrations as part of clinical care. The PK model for NVP was developed using a rich sampled dataset with up to wevern plasma samples collected in one dosing interval from a phase I/II study in the USA; International Maternal Pediatric and Adolescent AIDS Clinical Trials Network (IMPAACT) 377.47 HIV-infected children from 4 months to 17 years were randomly assigned to one of four stavudine-containing regimens, three of which contained NVP. The validated literature-based population PK model of NVP, used in the current analysis, was based on a larger dataset of NVP PK data from eight pediatric clinical trials,35 while only the USA data were available for our analysis of Ugandan and RRC children. Children &gt;12 years of age were excluded from the analysis.

Pharmacokinetic analyses
Using the validated literature-based models for EFV, LPV and NVP,31,35,36 we first evaluated whether measures of nutritional status in the RRC children could explain variability in oral clearance (CL/F) and volume of distribution (V/F). Therefore, WAZ and other measures of malnutrition, if available, were plotted independently against the individual PK parameters predicted by the previously published models.

This was followed by an analysis of the current data generated in Ugandan children. First, the differences in PK profiles of the three drugs between children from RRC countries and Uganda were studied using visual predictive checks (VPC). Using a VPC we compared the observations and simulated predictions to assess ability of the validated PK-models to reproduce the central tendency and the variability in the observed Ugandan data. A total of 1000 simulations were run based on dosing regimens of the patients, and using the PK-parameter values (including the inter- and intra-individual variability) obtained from the validated literate-based models of the RRC data.31,35,36 CYP2B6 polymoprhisms at published allele frequencies were incorporated into the NVP and EFV model and was assumed to be the same in RRC and Ugandan children.48 In order to determine whether nutritional status explained the difference between RRC and Ugandan children, we joined the RRC data and Ugandan data in one analysis. The literature-based models were refitted to the RRC and Ugandan datasets and all parameters were re-estimated (joint base model). Differences in Cl/F and V/F were studied between the estimations in RRC children dataset and the joint Uganda + RRC datasets. We determined whether measures of nutritional status could explain the variability in ARV apparent bioavailability (F1), oral clearance (CL/F) and volume of distribution (V/F) between the RRC and Ugandan children and within the cohort of the Ugandan children. This covariate search was performed using a stepwise covariate model-building procedure, described elsewhere.49–52

Analyses were performed using Nonlinear mixed-effects modeling (NONMEM VI, Globomaxx LLC, Hanover, MD, USA). Concentrations below the LLOQ were excluded from the first PK analyses. The estimation of the final PK-models was repeated including LLOQ data, with LLOQ values set at the value of ½ LLOQ.

Virologic outcome analysis
The observed PK variability between EFV, NVP and LPV and contrasting changes in exposure between Ugandan and RRC children suggests differences in virologic outcomes may occur. Thus, we sought to investigate distinctions in virologic outcomes for each treatment group (LPV, EFV, NVP). The primary outcome for this analysis was confirmed virologic failure (CVF), defined as having 2 sequential plasma HIV RNA levels of &gt; 400 c/ml after at least 24 weeks of ARV as previously described within the first 96 weeks of follow up.37 Multivariate COX regression models of CVF were developed, adjusting for age, baseline CD4 and baseline HIV RNA levels. As the number of ARV-naïve and -experienced children differed between treatment arms, outcomes were compared first between ARV-naïve and -experienced children. Then stratified Cox regression was performed with ARV-naïve versus experienced as a stratification factor. Comparisons were performed between NVP, LPV and EFV treated patients (subgroup analysis). To evaluate whether baseline nutritional status was an important predictor of CVF, we utilized the same models, but added, individually, baseline WAZ, HAZ, BAZ or “malnutrition”. In order to explore the relationship between PK of ARVs and CFV, we compared outcomes between patients without and with one or more concentrations below LLOQ and explored the correlation between exposure (estimated using individual AUC values) and CVF. Statistical analyses were performed using SPSS version 20.0 (IBM, Armonk, NY).

Results
Concentrations of EFV, LPV or NVP for 330 DBS from 163 Ugandan children were combined with concentrations for 1189 plasma samples from 204 RRC children. Ten percent of the concentrations for Ugandan children were below LLOQ. Overall, 14% of children with any value below LLOQ were malnourished while 7% of patients with all concentrations above LLOQ were malnourished (P=0.694). The median age of Ugandan children at the time of sampling was 4.0 yrs (range 0.7–7.2 years, Table 1), while children from RRC were slightly older with a median age of 5.8 yrs (range 0.5–12). While 22% of Ugandan children were underweight, only 8% of children from RRC were deemed underweight. 48% of Ugandan children were malnourished (underweight, thin and/or stunted). Most Ugandan children experienced moderate or severe household food insecurity (96%) and 40% experienced moderate to severe household hunger.

Population PK model
Using the historical RRC datasets and literature-based models for EFV, LPV and NVP.31,35,36 PK-parameters CL/F and V/F were estimated. No correlation between CL/F and nutritional status was seen for EFV, LPV nor NVP in RRC children. The prediction corrected VPCs indicate that the observed EFV and LPV concentrations in Ugandan children were in agreement with the simulated concentrations expected in these children based on the RRC population models (figure 1). In contrast, the observed NVP concentrations in Ugandan children were consistently above the median of the simulated concentrations expected in these children. Comparison of PK parameters between RRC models and joint base models showed that inclusion of Ugandan children in the model resulted in an increase in CL/F by 9% and 11% for EFV and LPV and a decrease in CL/F by 11% for NVP (Table 2). V/F was similarly altered (+4% for EFV, +6% for LPV, and −10% for NVP). As CL/F and V/F were both altered in the joint model, an altered F1 in Ugandan children was estimated. Compared to RRC children, F1 of EFV and LPV were reduced by 11% (P=0.045) and 18% (P=0.008) and F1 of NVP was 46% (P &lt; 0.001) higher in Ugandan children. The introduction of apparent bioavailability (F1) explained 4%, 2% and 6% of the inter-individual variability in EFV, LPV and NVP exposures respectively (Table 2). Although not significant, the introduction of F1 resulted in a large decrease in objective function value in comparison with estimating altered CL/F (P=0.655, P=0.403, P=0.371 for NVP, EFV and LPV respectively).

We compared ARV F1 between non-malnourished and malnourished Ugandan children and other measures of nutritional status. No significant difference in EFV F1 between non-malnourished and malnourished Ugandan children was observed. There was a trend toward lower LPV (P=0.114) exposures and higher NVP exposures (P=0.046) in malnourished in comparison to the non-malnourished Ugandan children (Table 2). In the Ugandan children the measures of HFIA and HHS were not predictive of ARV PK (data not shown).

As it is possible that children with concentrations below LLOQ were severely malnourished and had severe malabsorption, the estimation of the final PK-models was repeated after including LLOQ data. The inclusion of LLOQ data only affected the estimation of the volume of distribution of the drug and did not influence clearance. Including the LLOQ data did not affect any correlation between malnutrition and ARV PK (data not shown).

In order to assess the scope of potential problems using WHO dosing guidelines, minimum concentrations (Ctrough) in children from Uganda and RRCs, were predicted using the final PK model for EFV, LPV and NVP and the WHO dosing guidelines.38 Simulated EFV Ctrough fell below the minimum recommended Ctrough of 1 mg/L38,53 in 23% of Ugandan and RCC children (Table 3). For LPV, simulations suggest that weight based dosing will result in appropriate Ctrough38,53 concentrations in 97% Ugandan children. For NVP, Ctrough concentrations exceeded the minimum recommended Ctrough of 3 mg/L38,53 in 98% of Ugandan children (Table 3).

Virologic outcome analyses
Based on the relatively low bioavailability of EFV and LPV and high bioavailability of NVP in the Ugandan children compared to RRC, we hypothesized that there would be differences in virologic outcomes between the ARV treatment groups. All patients used in the PK-analysis were included in the outcome analysis. One patient was lost to follow up after three weeks of treatment and 1 patient did not reach 1 year follow up. All other patients reached at least 1 year follow up.

In adjusted multivariate models of CVF, no differences in CVF were noted between patients who were ARV-naïve or ARV-suppressed for the whole group or per treatment arm, Table 4). After stratification, no differences in CVF were noted between children receiving EFV, LPV or NVP (P= 0.773, P= 0.428, P= 0.729 respectively). Two children discontinued from NVP due to adverse reactions (Stevens-Johnson Syndrome and hepatitis), but EFV or LPV/r treatments were never changed due to concern for adverse reactions.39 Patients with one or more concentrations below LLOQ showed a higher chance of treatment failure in the whole group and specifically in the LPV treated patients (HR=2.08 and P=0.080, HR=4.09 and P=0.012 respectively). CVF was not explained by the exposure to ARVs (data not shown).

Based on the PK variability due to malnutrition, we hypothesized that poor nutrition may predict failure among the LPV and EFV, or conversely be protective against failure in NVP. None of the parameters of malnutrition were predictive of CVF (WAZ P=0.389, HAZ P= 0.587, BAZ P= 0.566, Malnutrition P=0.204, Table 4), even when restricting to ARV naïve (data not shown). In subgroup analyze, among children receiving LPV or EFV, baseline nutritional measures were not predictive of CVF (Table 4), but in the NVP arm, low WAZ and low HAZ were each at least marginally significantly associated with lower risk of CVF (WAZ HR= 1.54, P= 0.068, HAZ HR=1.48 P=0.034, Table 4).

Discussion
This study showed that EFV and LPV exposures were reduced by 11% and 18% among HIV-infected Ugandan children compared to children residing in resource-rich settings. Conversely, NVP exposures were 46% higher among Ugandan children. Notably, 23% of children on EFV exhibited trough concentrations less than the target level of 1 mg/L. Overall findings are attributed to distinctions in ARV bioavailability and nutritional detriments in our Ugandan cohort. Reduced exposure especially EFV may be clinically relevant for these children.54 Despite altered ARV bioavailability and a significant proportion of children from our cohort exhibiting CVF, there were no differences in virologic outcomes between the LPV/r, EFV or NVP treatment arms; findings that differ from the results of P1060, where children (&lt; 3 years) randomized to LPV/r versus NVP had superior virologic outcomes.55 Although exposures and CVF malnutrition were not directly predictive of CVF in our study, malnourished Ugandan children (compared to non-malnourished Ugandan children) showed a lower risk of CVF plus higher NVP exposure. Two children in the NVP group experienced significant adverse events which raise concerns over excessive NVP exposure. Individual virologic outcomes reflect an integral of drug exposure over a long period time resulting in a steady recovery of height and weight for the PROMOTE-PEDS trial children.56 Therefore, drug exposures and nutritional status which were captured only at specific points in time in our study may not adequately have captured differences in drug exposure throughout treatment.

The RRC and Ugandan cohorts emanate from different populations, variable in age, ethnicity and genetic background, pretreatment, drug dosing, lack of randomization, use of antimalarials and differences in adherence. In the analyses some variables could not fully be accounted for. As mutation frequency was unknown in our cohort, a literature based assumption was made that mutation frequency in the Ugandan children48 and RRC children35,57 were similar. Time of dosing was recorded by the patient and not observed by clinic staff. Guardians of 83% of children reported 100% adherence which suggests overly optimistic reporting. The fact that 13% of patients showed one or more concentrations below LLOQ suggests that these patients had missed full doses of LPV, despite adherence reporting suggesting otherwise. Patients with concentrations below LLOQ showed a higher CVF risk, suggesting that low ARV exposures due to non-adherence may lead to treatment failure. Previous studies show that food insecurity decreases adherence to ART,6 and poor adherence is associated with ART PK variability.58–60 Savic et al. showed that adherence, assessed using Medication Event Monitoring System (MEMS), explained much of the variability in atazanavir pharmacokinetics 35 European HIV infected adults.61 Future dedicated PK-studies using denser sampling techniques at specific times throughout treatment, (pre-existing) drug mutations and incorporating objective biomarkers of ARV adherence, would increase the understanding of PK variability and virologic outcomes due to malnourishment.

This is the first study which is specifically designed to study malnutrition in children. Nutritional status lowers bioavailability of EFV and LPV and increases bioavailability of NVP in Ugandan children. EFV and LPV was also previously studied by our group in Ugandan women from the PROMOTE-Pregnant women trial with food insecurity and these changes in PK are consistent with that study.46 Earlier PK-studies in malnourished children do not clearly show a correlation between malnutrition and ARV exposures. In a study of 41 HIV-infected Ugandan children receiving EFV, no relationship between WAZ or HAZ and EFV exposures was observed.34 Pollock et al. showed no independent effect of malnutrition on NVP exposures in 43 Malawian children.29 Ellis et al. showed reduced NVP concentrations in stunted children, but increased exposures in wasted children.26

Mechanistically, malnutrition may reduce albumin or α-acid glycoprotein concentrations,62,63 thereby increasing the free fraction of highly protein bound drugs such as LPV and EFV thus enhancing drug metabolism and elimination. High NVP exposures may also be explained by diminished auto-induction of NVP metabolism64,65 due to malnutrition.4,6 The lack of nutrition and/or a diet low in fat may also affect ARV absorption,66–70 or ARV cellular transport, especially of protease inhibitors.59,60,71,72 Future studies into the mechanisms by which malnourishment contributes to altered ARV-specific bioavailability will show whether the findings are generalizable to other malnourished children and may guide optimal ARV treatment in malnourished children.

In summary, the current study shows that altered ARV exposure in a cohort of Ugandan children with high rates of malnutrition and food insecurity results in modestly reduced bioavailability of EFV and LPV and increased bioavailability of NVP. In spite of previous findings, no difference in CVF was seen between treatment groups. Further studies to assess the impact of malnutrition on ARV pharmacokinetics, drug adherence and clinical outcomes in children residing in resource-limited settings are warranted.

* Simulations were performed using prediction corrected visual predictive checks.

Concentrations were predicted validated literate-based models for EFV, LPV and NVP. A visual predictive check compares the observations and simulated predictions and can be used to assess ability of the validated PK-models to reproduce the central tendency and the variability in the observed Ugandan data. correction is performed by normalizing the observed and simulated dependent variable within a single bin (clustered data) based on the typical population prediction for the median independent variable (eg. The individual clearance for a patient of 18 kg, is normalized to the population predicted clearance of a patient of that weight). The solid lines represent the 5th percentile, median and 95th percentile of the prediction corrected observed plasma concentrations. The semitransparent dark grey field represents a simulation-based 95% confidence interval for the median and the semitransparent light grey fields show the 95% confidence intervals of the simulated data.

1 Uganda: NVP suspension was dosed 10mg/ml (Aurobindo®, India) or as a 200mg tablet (Hetero® India) 160–200mg/m2. For the first 14 days of treatment, NVP was administered only once daily. After the first 14 days, NVP was administered every 12 hours. The NVP dose could be increased as long as there were no clinical concerns and Aspartate Aminotransferase (AST) and Alanine Aminotransferase (ALT) were normal.

RCC: NVP maintenance dose of 120mg/m2 was used in all patients (liquid or tablet formulation, Table 1)

2 Uganda: EFV was dosed as a suspension (Stocrin®30mg/ml solution Merck Sharp &amp; Dohme, Netherlands) 19.5 mg/kg/dose or as a 200mg tablet (Strides, India) 15mg/kg/dose once daily, with a maximum of 600mg/dose.

RRC: EFV dose in this trial ranged from 27mg/kg in young children to 10 mg/kg in children older than 5 years of age, and was administered as syrup, capsule or tablets. 31

Uganda: Ritonavir boosted LPV suspension (Kaletra ®, 80/20mg solution Abbvie, Germany) was dosed according weight, &lt; 7kg: 16/4mg/kg/dose, 7 to &lt;15 kg: 12/3mg/kg/dose, 15 to 40 kg: 10/2.5mg/kg/dose, &gt; 40 kg: 400/100 mg/dose, or as a 100/25mg tablet (Aluvia ® Abbvie, Germany): 15–25 kg: 200/50mg/dose &gt;25–35 kg: 300/75 mg/dose &gt;35 kg: 400/100 mg tabs)/dose twice daily.

RRC: The LPV dosage ranged from 8.9 – 26.0 mg/kg twice daily.36

3 Z-scores for weight, height and body mass index (BMI) were computed using WHO growth standards (2007).40

4 Underweight: &lt;−2SD WAZ,

5 Stunted &lt;−2SD HAZ41

6 Thin: &lt;−2SD BAZ42

7 Malnourished was classified as: underweight, stunted, and/or thinness.

8 Food insecurity was measured using the Household Food Insecurity Access Scale (HFIAS).43 Children were classified as living in households that were food secure, mild, moderately or severely food insecure.

9 Household hunger was classified using the Household Hunger Scale (HHS).44 Children were classified as living in households that were categorized as having little to no household hunger, moderate household hunger or severe household hunger.

10 Adherence in the Ugandan children was based on patient or parent/guardian report using a 3-day adherence recall and a visual analog scale. For the RRC studies, EFV adherence was monitored by telephone and at each follow-up visit, while LPV and NVP adherence was not specifically monitored.

EFV: efavirenz, LPV: lopinavir, NVP: nevirapine, WAZ: weight-for-age Z-score, BAZ: Body Mass Index for age Z-score. HAZ: height-for-age Z-score

In RRC we used the validated literate-based models and pediatric data for EFV, LPV and NVP, to calculate all PK-parameters.

In the Joint base model, the RRC data and Ugandan data were joined. The literature-based models were refitted to the RRC and Ugandan datasets and all PK-parameters were re-estimated (joint base model).

In the joint final model differences in exposures between Ugandan and RRC children were corrected for using an apparent F1. In the split Uganda model, ARV F1 was compared between non-malnourished and malnourished Ugandan children and other measures of nutritional status.

F1=apparent bioavailability, CL=clearance V= volume of distribution RRC= resource rich countries
