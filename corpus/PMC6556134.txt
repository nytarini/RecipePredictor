Conditioned eating in response to external food cues may contribute to obesity risk in young children.

Objectives:
To develop a brief, parent-reported scale to measure external food cue responsiveness for preschool-age children.

Methods:
Focus groups with parents of preschool-age children were conducted to create an initial pool of items reflecting children’s behavioral responses to external food cues. Items were included in a nationally-distributed online survey of parents of preschool-age children (n=456). Factor analysis was used to reduce the initial item pool, the scale’s psychometric properties were assessed, and scores were correlated with reported snacking behaviors.

Results:
Nine items met inclusion criteria in the final scale, which had high internal consistency (alpha=0.86). Final scores were the mean across the nine items. External food cue responsiveness was greater among children with, versus without, usual TV advertisement exposure. Furthermore, greater external food cue responsiveness mediated the relationship between children’s usual TV advertisement exposure and snacking during TV viewing. Findings remained statistically significant when adjusted for food responsiveness as measured with the Child Eating Behavior Questionnaire.

Conclusions:
Findings provide preliminary evidence that external food cue responsiveness is measurable by parental report in preschool-age children.

   Introduction
Childhood obesity remains a public health epidemic, as rates of obesity continue to rise in children.1 Currently, nearly one in four preschool-age children in the United States (US) have overweight or obesity,2 which greatly increases the lifetime risk of obesity and its associated comorbiditites.3,4 For example, children with overweight by the age of 5 years face a 4–5-fold increased risk of having overweight as adolescents3,4 and a significantly increased risk of having obesity as adults.5 The preschool years are a key formative time period in which to shape food preferences and eating behaviors,6–8 as habitual dietary patterns that are developed during childhood typically persist into adulthood.9 Therefore, early intervention on factors that encourage overeating during the preschool years may ultimately help children reduce their lifetime risk of obesity and improve their overall quality of life.10

A major factor contributing to the childhood obesity epidemic is exposure to an obesogenic environment,11–13 and for young children, the obesogenic environment is largely defined by ever-present and pervasive food marketing.14 Food marketing campaigns are carefully designed to influence and ultimately change attitudes, emotional reactions, and societal norms around food and eating behaviors.15,16 Frequent exposure to food marketing is concerning, as it may socially normalize the intake of energy-dense, nutrient-poor foods, such as processed snack foods.17 Furthermore, children may develop conditioned responses to the images and logos presented in food marketing campaigns, whereby these images themselves serve as a cue to eat specific food products.12,18,19 For example, neuroimaging studies among pre-adolescent children have demonstrated that exposure to food brand images20,21 and dynamic TV food advertisements22–25 cause distinct physiological responses in the brain, and these responses correlate with subsequent food choices,25 laboratory energy intake,21 and longitudinal weight gain24,26.

Indeed, behavioral studies have observed effects of external food cues on eating behavior in preschool-age children. For example, Robinson et al. demonstrated that food branding alters taste preference of foods in preschoolers;27 their study presented children with identical food items in plain and branded packaging and found that children preferred the branded items to the plain-packaged items. In another study, it was shown that even a brief 30-second exposure to televised food ads was able to shift food preference from a desired food to the advertised foods in 2–6-year-old children.28 It also has been repeatedly demonstrated that acute exposure to food marketing influences immediate snacking behaviors among children.29–32 For example, Keller et al. observed that the presence of food branding related to an increased intake of food during a meal in 4–6-year-old children with overweight but not their healthy weight counterparts33,34 Furthermore, exposure to food advertisements, relative to non-food advertisements, embedded within a children’s TV program related to greater consumption of snack foods among 3–5-year-old children in a randomized experiment.32

While these studies collectively provide some insight into the acute effects of environmental food cues on eating behaviors, relatively little is still understood about external food cue reactivity among preschool-age children outside of the laboratory setting. Being able to measure exposure and susceptibility to external food cues in naturalistic settings may be useful in identifying those who may be particularly vulnerable to the effects of an obesogenic food environment. Furthermore, identifying children who are vulnerable to such cues early in the lifespan may also help healthcare professionals quickly determine who would most benefit from interventions designed to reduce unhealthy cued eating prior to the onset of excessive weight gain.

Heightened responses to external or environmental food cues, herein defined as external food cue responsiveness, was first operationalized with a psychometric scale by van Strein and colleagues with the external eating subscale of the Dutch Eating Behavior Questionnaire (DEBQ).35,36 While the DEBQ was developed for adults, it has been adapted for children aged 7–12 years old (DEBQ-C)36,37 and includes six items related to children’s responses to external food cues (e.g., Desire to eat when walk past candy store, tempted when food is being prepared). However, to date, no scale exists that measures external food cue responsiveness as relevant to a contemporary preschool-age population. Overall food responsiveness among young children is often measured with the food responsiveness subscale of the Children’s Eating Behavior Questionnaire (CEBQ).38 That subscale includes five items related to children’s desire for food and the tendency to overeat (e.g., Given the choice, my child would eat most of the time). However, the CEBQ food responsiveness subscale does not specifically address children’s responsiveness to external cues, such as visual, environmental or social cues. A scale to specifically measure responsiveness to external foods is important to understand how aspects of the current obesogenic environment, including exposure to food marketing, may impact a young child’s obesity risk. The goal of the current study was to extend previous research and develop a brief, parent-reported scale to measure external food cue responsiveness for preschool-age children that could be employed easily in their natural environments. We sought to provide face validity for the usefulness of this new scale under free-living conditions in three ways. First, we correlated scores with an existing validated scale of food responsivity, the CEBQ.38 Second, the scale was compared against child weight status. Third, the scale was correlated with a common Cued snacking behavior, eating while watching TV. This line of research is important for identifying how aspects of a young child’s natural environment, including obesogenic features, may impact eating behaviors during this critical stage of development.

Methods
This study was conducted in two stages. In the first stage, focus groups were conducted with parents to create an initial pool of items to be included in an external food cue responsiveness scale for preschool-age children. In the second stage, items from the initial pool were included as part of a nationally-distributed online survey administered to parents recruited via social media, and statistical analyses were conducted to reduce the scale and assess the scale’s psychometric properties.

Initial Scale Construction
A series of eight focus groups among parents of 2–5-year-old children were completed between May and July 2017 in four communities located in Vermont and New Hampshire. Communities were selected to achieve a range of socioeconomic statuses; for example, the percent of school-age children eligible for free or reduced-price school lunch across the communities ranged from 3.9% to 50.5%.39 Focus groups were held in the morning, at lunchtime, or in the evening. Four of the six focus groups met at large local community centers, while the other two were held at large businesses with diverse workforces. Focus groups were one hour in length except for one, which was limited to 35 minutes to fit within employees’ lunch breaks. Participants were recruited via email list-serves, social media, flyers, and word of mouth. Participants were compensated $40 for participating. A total of 53 parents enrolled in the focus groups; 50 females and 3 males. If parents had multiple children within the age range being discussed (2–5 years) they were prompted not to focus on any one child. All procedures were approved of by the Dartmouth College Committee for the Protection of Human Subjects, which is the institutional review board at Dartmouth, and all participants provided written informed consent.

Two trained research assistants led each focus group, and the study’s principal investigator observed all focus groups but did not participate. Focus groups were moderated using a prepared script to query parents about their children’s behavioral reactions to external food cues in multiple situations including: environmental cues (e.g., passing by restaurants), locations that promote snacking (e.g., check-out aisles at grocery stores), social cues (e.g., seeing other eat), contextual cues (e.g., being at a party), sensory cues (e.g., hearing food wrappers, smelling food), and food marketing (e.g., food brand recognition). Two example series of questions were, Image you are in a grocery store or a big-box store like Walmart or Kmart; how does your child act when he or she sees some of his favorite brands of food or drinks, and, what about passing by a restaurant [that your child likes]– either driving in a car or walking by. What would your child do? Those types of questions enabled us to determine how much parents identified certain situations as prompting reactions among children and allowed us to understand the types of behaviors exhibited by children in these situations.

The study team ran one focus group to practice and refine the script before conducting the six focus groups used for the study. The maximum amount of time to spend on each section of questions was predefined to ensure all sections were addressed during the focus group. Each focus group was moderated by one research assistant as the lead moderator, and the second assistant discretely helped the lead moderator maintain the timeline. All focus groups were audio recorded with two portable audio recorders. The recordings were transcribed by a third research assistant who was not involved in the focus groups; any identifying information, including names, were recoded using generic terms. The study’s principal investigator listened to three to five, five minute random segments of each audio recording to assess the accuracy of each transcript; all segments were transcribed accurately.

A pool of potential scale items was developed using an iterative process. First, the research assistants and the principal investigator each independently created items to reflect children’s behaviors in response to external food cues based on their notes from the focus groups and from reading the transcripts. The study team was encouraged to include items from each of the multiple situations included in the interview script. All items were combined into one list and reviewed by the team to clarify items and to reduce redundant items. All items were also reviewed to ensure they were grammatically consistent.

A final pool of 33 potential items for the initial External Food Cue Responsiveness scale was created. All items were phrased to enable parents to rate how well each behavior described their own child’s behaviors and were scored on a 4-point Likert scale as rarely (1), sometimes (2), often (3), or a lot (4). The initial scale of 33 items was administered to a national sample of parents of 2–5-year-old children who were recruited via social media (Facebook, Twitter, Instagram, and Google Ads) using targeted, paid advertisements between November-December 2017. Most parents in the US use social media (e.g., 75% of parents in 2014).40 Interested participants who clicked on the study advertisement were brought to a secure website to complete a brief study screener. Neither the advertisement nor the study screener disclosed the true study intent. Eligibility included being a parent of a 2–5-year-old and living with that child at least 50% of the time. If parents had multiple children within the age range of the study (2–5 years) they were asked to answer questions considering their child who most recently had a birthday. Eligible participants who enrolled were compensated with a $20 gift card to a popular online retailer. All procedures were approved of by the Dartmouth College Committee for the Protection of Human Subjects, which is the institutional review board at Dartmouth, and all participants provided electronic written informed consent.

Child eating behaviors
As part of the online questionnaire, parents also completed the food responsiveness and satiety responsiveness subscales of the Child Eating Behaviors Questionnaire,38 a parent-reported questionnaire of young children’s eating behaviors. The food responsiveness subscale (CEBQFR) measures children’s desire to eat38, 41 and a tendency for obesogenic eating (e.g., If given the chance, my child would always have food in his/her mouth). Satiety responsiveness (CEBQ-SR) reflects children’s reactions to internal signals to stop eating (e.g., My child gets full easily). Both CEBQ-FR and CEBQ-SR include five items scored on a 5-point Likert scale, and final scores for each are the mean across the five items (range 1–5). Both subscales have high test-retest reliability38 among preschool-age children and have been validated against objective measures of eating among 4–5-year-olds.41

Child weight status
Parents classified their children’s weight (underweight, normal weight, overweight, or obese). Children with overweight or obesity are all grouped as having overweight in this study because only one child in the sample was reported as having obesity.

Child snacking when watching TV or movies
Snacking while watching TV was selected as an outcome measure because it is a common cued-eating behavior among young children.31 Parents reported the frequency with which their child asked for snacks when watching TV or movies: rarely, sometimes, often, or a lot, and responses were dichotomized as rarely/sometimes vs. often/a lot.

Child usual TV advertisement exposure
Viewing of advertisement-supported (i.e., ad-supported) TV is a valid proxy for exposure to TV food commercials.42 Parents reported the frequency (never, rarely, sometimes, often, or a lot) with which their children watched programs or shows over a series of children’s TV networks or streaming services (herein referred to as networks) in the past three months. The list includes seven primarily ad-free (PBS, Sprout, Nick Jr., Disney Jr., Disney, Netflix, and Amazon Prime) and seven ad-supported (Cartoon Network, Nickelodeon, Nick Toons, Teen Nick, Freeform/ABC Family, Disney XD, and Discovery Family) networks. Frequent viewing of each type of network was defined as watching that network often or a lot, and children were classified as either: not frequently watching any of the 14 networks, frequently watching only ad-free networks, or frequently watching any ad-supported networks.

Additional measures
Parents additionally reported their child’s age, gender, ethnicity, and race as well as their own age, relationship to the child, education level, and annual household income.

Statistical Analyses: Scale reduction and face validity
Consistent with the external eating subscale of the DEBQ-C,32 a one-dimensional scale for external food cue responsiveness was created. First, a series of revisions among the study team was conducted to remove highly redundant items and items that did not reflect children’s reactions to external food cues preceding a potential opportunity to eat (e.g., my child saves food wrappers or packages), resulting in a final pool of 22 items. Those 22 items were included in an orthogonal factor analysis with one factor using varimax rotation and polychoric correlations for ordinal data. Items that loaded on the factor at 0.60 or greater were retained in the final score, similar to the development of the DEBQ-C.32 Internal consistency of the final scale was assessed with an alpha coefficient for ordinal data,39 and a final score was computed as the mean across all scale items (range 1 to 4).

A sensitivity analysis was conducted to assess the stability of the scale items; specifically, the overall sample was randomly divided into two subsamples of equal size, the factor analysis was repeated in the two random subsamples, and the final items retained in the final scale were compared across the two samples to check for consistency. We also repeated the analyses, stratified by child sex, to determine if the model results were similar by sex.

Sample characteristics were summarized numerically, and External Food Cue Responsiveness scale scores were compared by child characteristics using one-way ANOVA with Tukey’s HSD post-hoc tests when comparing means between three or more groups, or t-tests when comparing means across two groups.

Face validity of the External Food Cue Responsiveness scale was assessed in three ways. First, final scores were compared to the CEBQ-FR and CEBQ-SR subscales using Pearson’s correlation coefficients to assess convergent and divergent validity, respectively. It was hypothesized that external food cue responsiveness would be positively correlated with CEBQFR and uncorrelated with CEBQ-SR. Second, mean scores were compared by child weight status using a one-way ANOVA, and a Poisson regression with robust standard errors was used to fit the risk of a child being overweight versus normal weight/underweight, both unadjusted and adjusted for CEBQ-FR. It was hypothesized that scores would be greater for children with overweight, independently of CEBQ-FR. Third, linear regression was used to model external food cue responsiveness by children’s usual TV advertisement exposure, adjusted for CEBQ-FR and covariates selected a priori (child’s age, gender, ethnicity, and race; and parental education level and annual household income). It was hypothesized that greater exposure to TV food advertisements would be predictive of higher external food cue responsiveness, independent of CEBQ-FR.

Finally, we assessed the ability of our novel scale to predict cued-eating related to food marketing exposure. Exposure to TV food advertisements is known to cue eating in children,31, 32 and we hypothesized that greater external food cue responsiveness would mediate that relationship. Therefore, we assessed if external food cue responsiveness would mediate the relationship between children’s usual TV advertisement exposure and snacking while watching TV or movies. The step-wise approach of Barron and Kenny43 was used to test for mediation, where a series of Poisson regression models with robust standard error estimation were used to model the relative risk of a child snacking while watching TV on children’s usual TV advertisement exposure, both unadjusted and adjusted for external food cue responsiveness. External food cue responsiveness was considered a mediator if main effects existed between snacking while watching TV and 1) children’s usual TV advertisement exposure and 2) external food cue responsiveness, separately, and if the main effect between children’s usual TV advertisement exposure and snacking while watching TV became non-significant once adjusted for external food cue responsiveness. We further examined if external food cue responsiveness would be more predictive of children’s snacking while watching TV than CEBQ-FR in that model. All regression models were adjusted for covariates as noted above. All main effects were considered statistically significant at P&lt;0.05, and analyses were completed with the R Language for Statistical Computing, version 3.4.2.

Results
Study sample recruited via social media
Among all respondents to the study advertisement placed in social media, 540 parents met the study eligibility criteria and 535 consented and enrolled. After a careful data cleaning process, we excluded 79 potential duplicates or entries from the same household, for a final sample size of 456 enrolled parents. The final study sample was socioeconomically diverse (Table 1).

Scale reduction
In the total sample, nine items met the inclusion criteria for the final scale with factor loadings ≥0.60 (Table 2). In the sensitivity analysis that completed the factor analysis among two random subsamples of equal sizes (Supplemental Table 1), six of the nine items in the final scale had factor loadings &gt;0.6 in both subsamples. The three remaining items had loadings &gt;0.5, indicating a strong correlation with external food cue responsiveness in the subsamples and so these items were retained in the final scale.

Loadings for the scale items were also similar when stratified by child sex (Table 2). For males, one item in the final scale did not meet the 0.60 threshold yet had a high loading at 0.59. For females, two items in the final scale did not meet the 0.60 threshold yet had high loadings at 0.55 and 0.56. Internal consistency of the final scale was high overall (ordinal alpha=0.86) and by sex (0.88 for males and 0.85 for females). The overall mean external food cue responsiveness score was 2.1 (SD=0.6). Mean scores did not differ by child age (ANOVA P=0.26) or gender (t test P=0.83), yet were greater for Hispanic (mean [SD] = 2.4 [0.6]) versus vs. non-Hispanic (2.1 [0.6]; t test P=0.01) children and greatest for Black children (2.5 [0.6]) versus children of other races (range of means=1.9–2.1; ANOVA post-hoc Tukey’s HSD t tests P&lt;0.001).

Face Validity
External food cue responsiveness was positively and linearly correlated with CEBQ-FR (r=0.68; P&lt;0.001) and inversely correlated with CEBQ-SR (r=−0.09; P=0.04), although the latter association was small in magnitude as hypothesized. External food cue responsiveness scores were highest for children with overweight (2.7 [0.6]) versus children with normal weight (2.1 [0.6]) or underweight (2.1 [0.5]; ANOVA P&lt;0.001). The relative risk of being overweight was 4.44 for each 1-unit increase in external food cue responsiveness (95% CI: 3.17, 3.23), and that risk remained elevated after adjusting for CEBQ-FR (RR: 2.86; 95% CI: 1.69, 4.83). Results did not change when excluding children who were reported as underweight.

In an adjusted linear regression model (Table 3), children’s usual exposure to TV advertisements was predictive of external food cue responsiveness, independently of CEBQ-FR and sociodemographic characteristics. Specifically, external food cue responsiveness was, on average, 0.38 points greater (P&lt;0.001) for children who frequently viewed any ad-supported network compared to children who did not frequently view any of the included networks. Notably, there was no statistically significant difference between the average scores of children who frequently viewed only ad-free networks and those who did not frequently view any of the included networks. External food cue responsiveness did not differ by child ethnicity or race in this adjusted model.

The risk of a child snacking while watching TV was elevated with frequent viewing of only ad-free networks (RR: 1.37; 95% CI: 0.95,1.98) and frequent viewing of any ad-supported network (RR: 1.87; 95%: 1.30, 2.68), yet only the latter was statistically significant (Table 4, model 1). However, once adjusted for external food cue responsiveness, the main effect between frequent viewing of any ad-supported network was attenuated 30% and was no longer statistically significantly associated with snacking while watching TV (Table 4, model 2), supporting that external food cue responsiveness mediated the association between children’s usual TV advertisement exposure and snacking while watching TV. Conversely, while CEBQFR was related to snacking while watching TV, it did not fully explain the relationship between children’s usual TV advertisement exposure and this outcome (Table 4, model 3), and CEBQ-FR was not related to the risk of snacking while watching TV once further adjusted for external food cue responsiveness (Table 4, model 4).

Discussion
This study aimed to develop and provide preliminary face validity of a brief, parent-reported scale to assess external food cue responsiveness among preschool-age children that we have termed the External Food Cue Responsiveness scale. Findings supported a 9-item scale with high internal consistency that was consistent in both male and female children. The scale demonstrated convergent and divergent validity in the expected directions against validated measures of children’s eating behaviors, scores were positively associated with both children’s weight status and usual TV advertisement exposure above and beyond CEBQ-FR, and external food cue responsiveness mediated the relationship between children’s usual TV advertisement exposure and snacking while watching TV, a common cued-eating behavior among young children. Collectively, findings suggest that this novel scale effectively captures children’s behavioral responsiveness to external food cues and, in particular, cues related to food marketing.

As expected, external food cue responsiveness was positively associated with food responsiveness, as measured with the CEBQ-FR. CEBQ-FR was also predictive of children snacking when watching TV when not adjusted for external food cue responsiveness. These findings are not unexpected as the CEBQ-FR is reflective of obesogenic eating behaviors,41 and it is likely that children who score high on the CEBQ-FR are quick to develop conditioned responses to external food cues. However, our findings suggest that the external food cue responsiveness scale captures a unique aspect of conditioned eating above and beyond that measured by the CEBQ-FR. Specifically, external food cue responsiveness was indirectly responsible for facilitating the effects of children’s usual TV advertisement exposure on snacking while watching TV, while CEBQ-FR did not. However, both may be useful in identifying children that are at risk of developing overweight or obesity. For example, greater food responsiveness as measured with the CEBQ-FR has been associated with a genetic predisposition to obesity,44 and measuring external food cue responsiveness and CEBQ-FR jointly may better identify children’s obesity risk.

Our work extends that of previous groups36 by developing a scale to measure external food cue responsiveness specifically in preschool-age children. The DEBQ-C is a validated scale that has been shown to measure external food responsiveness in children as young as seven. Interesting, our scale differs from the DEBQ-C in several ways that may indicate the different ways that food marketing influences young children. For example, our scale has several items that relate to snacking; and specificity around snacking may be particularly important, as exposure to food marketing has been shown consistently to influence snack intake,31 but not necessarily meal intake,45 in young children. Our scale also includes items about branded packaging, product placement, and restaurant logos, which are all aspects of food marketing that impact young children’s eating behaviors yet have not been operationalized into an easy-to-administer scale. Our scale also includes items related to social aspects of food consumption behavior, which are likely important, as consumption behaviors of peers have been shown to influence eating behaviors in preschool-age children,46 and food marketers attempt to exploit children’s focus on peer modeling in their advertisments.17 Therefore, the External Food Cue Responsiveness scale provides a succinct, parent-report tool for the measurement of external food cue responsiveness in preschool-age children that demonstrates preliminary validity in measuring children’s conditioned behavioral responses to food marketing.

Future studies may benefit from comparing results of the CEBQ-FR, DEBQ-C and the External Food Cue Responsiveness scale in both young and older children to assess the comparability between these two scales. Furthermore, the External Food Cue Responsiveness scale needs formal validation in the laboratory setting against standard methods for measuring external food cue responsiveness such as eating in the absence of hunger (EAH) protocols. Our analysis found that External Food Cue Responsiveness scores were greatest among Hispanic and Black children. That is not surprising, as studies suggest that food marketers specifically targeted these demographics.47–49 Therefore, this finding supports our underlying hypothesis that external food cue responsiveness may be related to food marketing exposure. However, future studies are needed to clarify that relationship before any conclusions can be made.

There are several strengths to this study. The use of focus groups to shape the initial item pool, rather than adapting an existing scale, ensures that our scale items are specific to a contemporary preschool-age population. This study also has a large and diverse, nationally recruited sample, providing more generalizability than regional samples might afford.50 While our findings are promising, we caution over-interpretation of these results pending replication of these findings and further validation of this questionnaire, particularly against objective measures of external food cue exposure such as EAH. Furthermore, this scale should be formally tested and compared with other existing scales such as the CEBQ-FR and DEBQ-C. It is important to note that the results of this study are based on cross-sectional, self-reported measures, including the reported weight status of the children. Additionally, we lack an objective measure of children’s food marketing exposure. However, initial results are promising, as they demonstrate that the construct of external food cue responsiveness, and its relationship to eating behaviors, is existent and measurable by our scale in preschool-age children.

In conclusion, this study developed a brief, parent-reported scale to measure response to external food cues in preschool-age children known as the External Food Cue Responsiveness scale. Our findings provide preliminary evidence that external food cue responsiveness is measurable by parental report. This study further demonstrates that external food cue responsiveness may be predictive of cued-snacking behaviors in preschool-age children. While additional validation employing objective measures of various food cue exposures is needed, this new scale may provide a better understand for how an obesogenic food environment shapes the development of children’s eating behaviors at a young age.

Sample included 456 parents of preschool-age children; parents were recruited via social media.

1 Each model is a Poisson regression model with robust standard errors, adjusted for child age, gender, ethnicity and race; and parent education and annual household income.

2 Parents reported how often their children asked for snacks when watching TV or movies, and analyses compared those who asked “often” or “a lot” for snacks, n=214, to those who asked “rarely” or “sometimes”, n=242.

3 Advertisment-free children’s networks included PBS, Sprout, Nick Jr., Disney Jr., Disney, Netflix and Amazon Prime. Advertisement-supported children’s networks included Cartoon Network, Nickelodeon, Nick Toons, Teen Nick, Freeform (ABC Family), Disney XD and Discovery Family. Parents reported the frequency in which their children watched each of the 14 networks; responses of “often” or “a lot” (versus never, rarely or sometimes) were defined as frequent viewing.
