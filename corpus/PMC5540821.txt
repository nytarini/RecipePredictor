Foodborne illness affects 1 in 4 US residents each year. Few of those sickened seek medical care or report the illness to public health authorities, complicating prevention efforts. Citizens who report illness identify food establishments with more serious and critical violations than found by regular inspections. New media sources, including online restaurant reviews and social media postings, have the potential to improve reporting.

Objective
We implemented a web-based Dashboard to identify and respond to tweets about food poisoning from St. Louis City residents.

Design &amp; setting
This report examines the performance of the Dashboard in its first seven months after implementation in the City of St. Louis Department of Health.

Main outcome measures
We examined the number of relevant tweets captured and replied to, the number of foodborne illness report received as a result of the new process, and the results of restaurant inspections following each report.

Results
In its first seven months (October 2015 – May 2016), the Dashboard captured 193 relevant tweets. Our replies to relevant tweets resulted in more filed reports than several previously existing foodborne illness reporting mechanisms in St. Louis during the same time frame. The proportion of restaurants with food safety violations was not statistically different (p=.58) in restaurants inspected after reports from the Dashboard compared to those inspected following reports through other mechanisms.

Conclusions
The Dashboard differs from other citizen engagement mechanisms in its use of current data allowing direct interaction with constituents on issues when relevant to the constituent to provide time-sensitive education and mobilizing information. In doing so, the Dashboard technology has potential for improving foodborne illness reporting and can be implemented in other areas to improve response to public health issues like suicidality, spread of Zika virus, and hospital quality.


   Introduction
Foodborne illness affects 1 in 4 Americans and costs approximately $2–$4 billion annually in the US.1 Although the CDC classifies foodborne illness as a winnable battle,2 or a priority “with large-scale impact on health and known effective strategies to address [it],” as few as 2.9% of those who become sick seek medical care and most do not report their illness.3,4 As a result, existing systems capture a small fraction of the disease burden, making prevention and evaluation of policies and programs challenging.3,5

Local health departments (LHDs) nationwide license and inspect restaurants to ensure food safety and respond to reports of suspected foodborne illness. Restaurants with lower inspection scores have higher foodborne illness outbreak rates,6 and inspections prompted by consumer reporting tend to identify more serious and critical violations than regular inspections.7 In 2012–2013, the New York City Department of Health and Mental Hygiene used Yelp reviews to identify restaurants where patrons became ill.7 In 2013–2014, the Chicago Department of Public Health (CDPH) used Twitter to identify and respond to food poisoning tweets.8 These programs were successful in identifying and addressing food safety violations,7,8 providing evidence of the potential of new media to improve foodborne illness reporting.

In St. Louis, reporting suspected food poisoning to the Department of Health (STL-DOH) can happen in seven ways: a phone call, tweet, fax, or email to the Citizen Service Bureau (CSB), direct contact with inspectors by another health department or source, or completing a form on the STL-DOH website. These reporting mechanisms resulted in 46 consumer reports in 2014 from a city of 318,000 residents.

In 2015, the STL-DOH partnered with Washington University in St. Louis to implement the HealthMap Foodborne Dashboard (Dashboard) developed at Boston Children’s Hospital. The Dashboard monitors Twitter for food poisoning tweets globally but can focus on a specific geographic area. This evaluation examines the performance of the Dashboard after implementation in St. Louis.

Methods
We set the Dashboard to capture tweets including “food poisoning”, “foodpoisoning”, or both, and to classify them as relevant, unclear, or not relevant using a supervised machine learning classifier. The two terms were selected based on informal tests during development that found these terms together captured most relevant tweets with the fewest irrelevant tweets. Starting October 2015, the Dashboard displayed machine-classified tweets within a 50 mile radius around St. Louis and a human reviewed each tweet to verify or change the machine classification. Tweets were reviewed and classified daily; Table 1 shows example tweets.

After machine and human classification, we used a reply feature in the Dashboard to construct a reply to each tweet human classified as relevant or unclear; reviewing, classifying, and replying to a tweet takes less than one minute. Following work by CDPH,9 reply tweets included an empathy statement expressing concern for the person (e.g., Sorry to hear you’re ill), an authority statement identifying the official source of the tweet (e.g., The City can help you report it), and a call-to-action (e.g., Click here) with a link to a form for reporting illness to STL-DOH. An example of a full reply would be: Sorry to hear you’re ill. The City can help you report it. Click here: [URL]. The @FoodSafetySTL Twitter account used to send reply tweets is an official account linked to the STL-DOH website in the Twitter profile.10 Information from reports submitted through the form was treated the same as information from other reporting mechanisms. This study was approved by the Institutional Review Board at Washington University in St. Louis (ID#201601097).

Results
In its first seven months of operation, the Dashboard identified 442 tweets, or approximately two tweets per day, within the radius including one or more food poisoning terms. Of these, the machine classified 214 tweets as relevant, 24 as unclear, and 204 as not relevant (Table 1). Human coding agreed for 66.4% of relevant tweets, 8.3% of unclear tweets, and 77.5% of not relevant tweets. A human classified 217 tweets as relevant or unclear; 24 of these were not in St. Louis or were from a user who had tweeted and been replied to recently, so 193 tweets received a reply. Thirteen replies, or 6.7% of tweets replied to, resulted in a report submission. Five of the 13 reports were in the STL-DOH jurisdiction, while eight were in neighboring jurisdictions and were forwarded to those jurisdictions. During this same time frame, the STL-DOH received 32 other foodborne illness reports by fax or direct tweet (none), the existing web form (three), directly from the county health department (three), directly from other sources (three), through email (six), and by phone (17; Figure 1 Supplemental).

The STL-DOH inspects all restaurants reported by patrons as a possible source of illness. One restaurant was identified in two reports (one phone and one email report) on the same day and was only inspected once, another report had no evidence of illness, and one inspection was not entered into the database properly so the score was unclear. The 34 total inspections completed and entered during the study period included five from Dashboard forms and 29 from other sources. Of the five via the Dashboard, 2 (40%) had no violations, 2 (40%) had non-critical violations, and 1 (20%) had non-critical and critical violations. Of the 29 other inspections, six (21%) had no violations, 13 (45%) had non-critical violations, and 9 (31%) had non-critical and critical violations. A Fisher’s Exact Test found no significant difference in the proportion of restaurants with and without violations (p=.57) reported via the Dashboard compared to other reporting methods.

Discussion
In our pilot study, we found the Dashboard to have the potential for improving foodborne illness reporting through increased citizen engagement. In the first seven months of Dashboard use, the only mechanisms resulting in more reports than the Dashboard were phone and email. The large number of phone reports is consistent with research identifying phone numbers and web forms as recommended ways to increase foodborne illness reporting by the public.4 Inspection results were not significantly different for reports originating with the Dashboard compared to other reports.

We identified a few limitations during this pilot phase to address as we work with existing and new partners on Dashboard implementation in health departments. First, we observed disagreement between human and machine classification. This likely happened because the Dashboard was designed to label and display all tweets fitting a broad search criteria rather than setting a stricter threshold and missing relevant tweets, and the process of developing a reliable machine learning classifier is iterative implying that as more data becomes available, the accuracy of the machine learning labelling should improve. We are examining the features of the misclassified tweets and will use the information to retrain the classifier with these features in order to improve machine-human agreement. Second, St. Louis City borders St. Louis County, which is home to many restaurants. We forwarded complaints about county restaurants to the county health department but were not able to track their progress. In future efforts, we will encourage Dashboard partnerships in geographic areas served by multiple LHDs. In addition, while government agencies in urban areas often implement innovative public health programs through new technology,11 the project was the first of its kind in St. Louis City and recipients of a @FoodSafetySTL tweet may have been skeptical given the lack of a local track record. As adoption of new technology for citizen engagement in public health increases, we expect @FoodSafetySTL trust and engagement to also increase.12,13 The Dashboard is still in use by the STL-DOH; you can find @FoodSafetySTL on Twitter and more information on the STL-DOH website.

The Dashboard differs from other citizen engagement mechanisms in its use of current data allowing interaction with constituents on issues when the issue is relevant to the constituent to provide education and mobilizing information. Prior studies have demonstrated that the interactive and real-time nature of social media benefits government and the public during emergencies and for everyday concerns.12 Government use of social media also improves perceived transparency and increases trust in government,13 resulting in increased public interaction with government. Given extremely low reporting rates for foodborne illness3,4 and limited public knowledge of reporting processes,4 increasing trust and interaction between government and the public through social media is a promising strategy for food safety. About 23% of the US population uses Twitter including more urban residents, men, college graduates, and higher income earners, but fewer whites or adults aged 65+.14 Extending the Dashboard to other social media could also improve reporting among non-Twitter users.

The Dashboard technology also has potential to aid in educating the public by retweeting food safety tweets captured by the Dashboard and alerting citizens to the process of reporting foodborne illness to their health department. In addition, there are uses for the Dashboard beyond food safety. Dashboard technology has been adapted to examine tweets about hospital quality15 and a similar approach has been used to identify tweets associated with suicidality.16 The Dashboard could also be used to alert health departments of local tweets about concerns like standing water that encourages spread of Zika in a community.
