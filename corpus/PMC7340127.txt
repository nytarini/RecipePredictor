To evaluate breakfast location and children’s food choices.

Methods:
Cross-sectional analysis of 1,371 fourth- through sixth-grade students in 2013. Foods and beverages in 17 categories characterized breakfast choices: (1) ≥ 1 fruits or vegetables, (2) ≥ 1 foods high in saturated fats and added sugars (SFAS), and (3) meeting School Breakfast Program (SBP) requirements.

Results:
Among breakfast eaters (n = 1,133; 82.6%), 46.0% ate at home, 13.1% ate at school, 41.0% ate at multiple locations; and 21.8% ate at a corner store. Those eating at school were more likely to consume ≥1 fruit or vegetable (odds ratio [OR] = 1.90; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.26–2.87), less likely to eat ≥1 SFAS food (OR = 0.46; 95% CI, 0.22–0.94), and more likely to meet SBP requirements (OR = 2.47; 95% CI, 1.42–4.29). Those eating at corner stores (n = 247) were more likely to consume high-SFAS foods (63.9% vs 9.2%; P &lt; .001).

Conclusions and Implications:
Eating school breakfast increased the odds of consuming fruit, choosing lower SFAS, and meeting nutritional requirements of the SBP relative to other locations.

   INTRODUCTION
Among US children aged 6–11 years, breakfast provides 18% to 19% of total daily energy intake but a relatively greater proportion of daily intake of several nutrients of public health concern among Americans,1 includ-ing vitamin D (40% to 42%), calcium (26%), fiber (21%), and iron (32%).2

Breakfast consumption has been positively associated with academic outcomes.3–5 Conversely, 12% to 34% of US children report skipping break-fast, which has been associated with a 2–5 times lower likelihood of meeting recommended nutrient intakes,6 poorer memory,5,7 and a twofold increased risk of obesity.3,8–11 Thus, whether children eat breakfast is important.3,11–15 This study exam-ined the extent to which the types of breakfast foods children consume are influenced by location.

School has become an increasing-ly important context for breakfast. The US School Breakfast Program (SBP) was permanently authorized in 1975 to provide nutritious breakfasts, target-ing lower-income children.16 Currently, the SBP serves approximately 11.2 million children per day.17 Eating breakfast at school vs home is associated with higher daily intakes of some nutrients including energy, protein, and sodium.6,18 Alternatively, many youth report eating in the morning at corner stores,9,19–21 where food pur-chases tend to be rich in energy and low in nutrients.21 However, little is known about the influence of loca-tion on children’s breakfast food choices.

The objective of this research was to evaluate children’s breakfast food choices based on location(s) among low-income, urban, fourth- to sixth-grade youth. Specifically, the research team evaluated whether consump-tion of fruits and vegetables (FV) or foods high in saturated fats and added sugars (SFAS), as well as meeting nutritional (ie, meal component) requirements of the SBP at breakfast varied based on whether consump-tion occurred at school, home, and/ or corner stores.22 Currently, a majority of school-aged children do not meet recommended guidelines for FV and exceed the 2015 Dietary Guidelines for Americans’ SFAS recommendations.1,23 Understanding the role of location in the quality of children’s breakfast choices may inform interventions to improve breakfast consumption among youth.

METHODS
Design
The researchers conducted a cross-sectional analysis using baseline data from a randomized control trial to promote school breakfast consump-tion. All participating schools had universal breakfast policies in which breakfast was available to all stu-dents free of charge before school in the cafeteria. Data were obtained in October through December, 2013. Stu-dents completed measures in the morning, after the cafeteria breakfast was offered and before scheduled lunches. No schools offered snacks before lunch. Students completed surveys independently on electronic tablets. Trained research staff provid-ed instructions and were available during survey administration to answer questions. The school district provided additional student sociodemographic data.

Participants and Setting
Participants were fourth- to sixth-grade students recruited from 16 kindergarten to eighth-grade Philadel-phia public schools. Schools were eligible if they met the following in-clusion criteria for the larger trial from which baseline data presented here were taken: (1) at least 50% of students qualified for free or reduced price lunch, (2) they did not have an exist-ing classroom breakfast feeding program (or were willing to give up classroom breakfast feeding for the du-ration of the study), and (3) they received Supplemental Nutrition Assis-tance Program–Education nutrition programming. The student-level exclusion criterion was developmental or behavioral disorders affecting the ability to understand and/or com-plete the breakfast survey.

Schools were matched for school size, race/ethnicity composition, and food service type (full-service vs sat-ellite cafeterias); 25 schools were invited to participate. Nine schools de-clined owing to an unwillingness to accept randomization. Eligible and par-ticipating schools were similar to other schools in the district with respect to percent minority, size, and percent qualifying for free and reduced lunch.24 Mean ± SD percent eligibility for free or reduced-price meals from the Na-tional School Lunch Program for the 16 schools at the time of school recruit-ment (spring, 2013) was 89.7% ± 6.3%. The study was approved by and con-ducted in accordance with the ethical standards of the Office of Research and Evaluation at the School District of Philadelphia and the Institutional Review Board at Temple University.

Research staff visited each class-room to explain the study and distribute consent and assent forms. All fourth- through sixth-grade class-rooms in the enrolled schools participated in the study. Among the 2,715 eligible students, active paren-tal consent and child assent were obtained for 1,463 students (53.9%); consent rates did not differ by condi-tion (intervention: 54.6%, control: 53.7%). Students did not receive com-pensation for participation; the 16 schools each received $1,000 for par-ticipating. From the sample, 91 children were removed from analy-ses (42 transferred schools before data collection, 31 started the classroom breakfast portion of the intervention during the baseline period, 10 were in special education, 4 had incomplete height and weight measurements, 1 was chronically absent, and 1 had missing survey data). The final sample consisted of 1,371 children.

Measures and Data Collection Procedures
The school district provided chil-dren’s race/ethnicity, sex, month and year of birth, and grade level. Chil-dren’s race/ethnicity, as categorized by the school district based on parent report, was black, Hispanic, white, Asian, or other.

Children’s self-reported breakfast intake on the day of the breakfast pat-terns survey was assessed using a questionnaire developed for ethnical-ly diverse, low-income, school-aged children in New York City.9,20 Foods and beverages in 17 categories in-cluded typical breakfast foods (eg, milk and eggs categories) from school menus used in Philadelphia9,21 and New York City,20 as well as nontypi-cal breakfast foods (eg, chips and candy categories). Children were first asked, Did you eat/drink anything today? Children who answered affirmatively marked foods and beverages con-sumed in 17 categories separately for each of 4 locations: home, corner store, school cafeteria, and other. Students were instructed to omit foods that had been acquired but not yet consumed. Foods were recorded as being con-sumed in the location where the food was acquired. Children who reported drinking only water were not counted as having consumed breakfast. On average, students took approximate-ly 5–10 minutes to complete the survey.

Children’s food choices at break-fast were characterized in several ways. Consumption of high-SFAS foods was characterized by intake of ≥1 foods in the following categories (yes/no): chips, candy, and sugar-sweetened bev-erages. Consumption of SFAS was evaluated with and without the cat-egories of muffins, donuts, and pastries because low-saturated fat versions of these foods were served as part of the SBP at the time of the study. Con-sumption of FV was characterized by eating ≥1 foods in the following categories (yes/no): fruits, vegetables, and 100% fruit juice; consumption was evaluated with and without 100% fruit juice. Meeting nutritional require-ments of the SBP was characterized by 1 of the following meal component combinations in accordance with 2014–2015 guidelines22: (1) 1 FV, 1 grain, and 1 milk; (2) 1 FV and 2 grains; or (3) 1 FV, 1 grain, and 1 meat or meat alternative. Of the 17 food cat-egories assessed, consumption of foods and drinks from the fruits, vegetables, and 100% fruit juice categories were counted as meeting the FV component. Consumption of foods from the 192 categories of cereal; bread; waffles, french toast, and pancakes; muffins, donuts, and pastries; and breakfast sandwiches were counted as meeting the grains component. Consump-tion of a breakfast sandwich, meat, eggs, or yogurt/cheese was counted as a component of the meat/meat alternatives. Breakfast was defined as any food or drink consumed between when participants woke up in the morning and when they filled out the survey. Number of breakfasts con-sumed was defined by number of locations at which children consumed food or drinks.

Data Analyses
The researchers used Stata/SE (Release 14, Stata Statistical Software, StataCorp LP, College Station, TX, 2015) for all statistical analyses. Descriptive statis-tics were generated for all relevant variables. Wald chi-square tests of in-dependence were used to describe differences in child race/ethnicity, sex, and grade level by breakfast loca-tion. Logistic regression models and margins estimated at covariate means were used to predict probability of FV consumption, SFAS food consumption, and meeting SBP nutrition requirements by breakfast location(s), as well as comparisons of food and beverage categories across location combinations. Breakfast location vari-ables were used to predict FV and SFAS outcomes. All models were adjusted for race/ethnicity, sex, and grade. P &lt; .05 was considered to indicate statistical significance. All analyses used clus-tered sandwich estimators to adjust for within-school clustering.

RESULTS
Demographics
The sample was 51.3% female and 66.5% black. Students were divided approximately equally across the 3 target grades (fourth grade: 35.2%; fifth grade: 34.8%; sixth grade: 30.0%). Approximately 80% of students qualified for free or reduced-price meals, as defined by federal poverty guidelines (Table 1). Location of breakfast con-sumption did not differ by grade level but varied with sex (degrees of freedom = 5; n = 1,133; P &lt; .001) and race/ethnicity (degrees of freedom = 5; n = 1,133; P &lt; .001). Compared with boys, girls were more likely to eat at home only (49.1% vs 42.7%; P &lt; .05) and home or a corner store (11.8% vs 6.4%; P &lt; .05), and less likely to eat at school or home (17.7% vs 12.1%; P &lt; .05). Black children (66.4% of the sample) were less likely to eat at home only (39.9% vs 58.0%; P &lt; .05) and more likely to eat at school only (14.6% vs 10.0%; P &lt; .05), home or a corner store (11.0% vs 5.5%; P &lt; .05), school or home (15.3% vs 13.9%; P &lt; .05), and other location combina-tions (14.0% vs 8.7%; P &lt; .05, compared with non-black children.

Breakfast Locations
On the morning of data collection, almost 20% of children skipped break-fast (17.4%; n = 238), half ate breakfast in 1 location (51.8%; n = 710), and almost a third ate breakfast in multi-ple locations (30.9%; n = 423). Most children reported consuming a food or beverage at home (79.3%) and more than a third of children reported having a food or beverage at school (38.6%); 21.8% of children reported having a food or beverage at a corner store and 7.1% of children reported consuming a food or beverage ob-tained from another location such as a relative’s home.

Among students who ate in mul-tiple locations (n = 423), home or school (39.7%), home or a corner store (24.6%), and home or school or a corner store (12.8%) were the most fre-quent location combinations.

Associations of Type of Breakfast Location with Foods and Beverages Consumed
Table 2 lists associations among break-fast location and children’s odds of consuming FV and SFAS, and meeting SBP requirements. Children who ate at school had higher odds of consum-ing FV than did children who did not eat at school (OR = 4.09; 95% CI, 2.66– 6.28). Children had greater odds of consuming FV when they ate break-fast only at school (OR = 1.90; 95% CI, 1.26–2.87), at school or home (OR = 4.01; 95% CI, 2.69–5.99), at school or home or a corner store (OR = 4.42; 95% CI, 2.37–8.25), or at other location combinations (OR = 2.68; 95% CI, 1.91–3.74), com-pared with eating breakfast only at home. When juice was excluded from the FV analysis, children had lower odds of consuming FV when they ate at school only (OR = 0.46; 95% CI, 0.26–0.83) and greater odds of consuming FV when they ate at home or a corner store (OR = 1.78; 95% CI, 1.0– 3.1, home or school or a corner store (OR = 3.1; 95% CI, 1.5–6.2), and school or home (OR = 1.7; 95% CI, 1.1–2.6) compared with children who at break-fast only at home.

The odds of consuming high-SFAS foods were greater among children who reported eating at corner stores, compared with children who did not report eating at corner stores (OR = 18.81; 95% CI, 14.04–25.21). Compared with children who ate breakfast only at home, children who ate only at school had lower odds of consuming high-SFAS foods (OR = 0.46; 95% CI, 0.22–0.94) but higher odds when they ate at home or a corner store (OR = 19.05; 95% CI, 10.82–33.53), at school or home or a corner store (OR = 29.17; 95% CI, 18.70–45.5), at school or home (OR = 1.92; 95% CI, 1.02–3.61), and at other location combinations (OR = 16.54; 95% CI, 9.78–28.0). When muffins, donuts, and pastries were in-cluded in the SFAS analysis, children had higher odds of consuming SFAS when they ate at school only (OR = 4.17; 95% CI, 1.92–905) and other combinations involving school (data not shown), compared with chil-dren who ate only at home.

Overall, only 7.2% of children who ate breakfast consumed foods and bev-erages, including juice, that met the national SBP meal component require-ments. Fourteen percent of children who ate exclusively at school met SBP requirements, compared with 6.1% of children who ate exclusively at home. Compared with children who ate breakfast only at home, children who ate exclusively at school had greater odds of meeting SBP requirements (OR = 2.47; 95% CI, 1.42–4.29). The number of breakfast locations re-ported was unassociated with the odds of meeting national SBP requirements.

Across all locations, the 5 most frequently consumed foods were milk (46.7%), cereal or oatmeal (37.7%), 100% fruit juice (30.2%), waffles, french toast, and pancakes (22.2%), and muffins, donuts, and pastries (21.5%) (Table 3). The percentage of children reporting consumption of cereal, oatmeal, eggs, meat, and whole FV was lower for those who ate ex-clusively at school vs exclusively at home. The percentage of children re-porting consumption of 100% fruit juice and muffins, pastries, and dough-nuts, however, was higher among eating those exclusively at school than those eating exclusively at home. The percentage of children reporting consumption of candy, chips, and SSB was higher among those who ate break-fast at a corner store in combination with other locations, compared with children who ate breakfast exclu-sively at home.

DISCUSSION
This research reveals that the type of breakfast foods consumed by urban school-aged youth differed by loca-tion. Consistent with previous studies,9,20,25 children ate breakfast in varied locations, with almost a third eating in multiple locations. School breakfast was positively associated with FV intake, which was primarily due to children’s consumption of 100% fruit juice. This finding is notable because more than three quarters of US grade-schoolchildren do not meet national recommendations for FV intake.26 Furthermore, children who ate exclusively at school were more likely to consume a breakfast that met meal compo-nent requirements of the SBP; however, this proportion (14%) was relatively small. Finally, children who ate breakfast only at school were less likely to consume SFAS foods than were children who ate only at home. Consumption of SFAS foods was most pronounced among children who ate at corner stores, which is important given the role of SFAS in weight man-agement and chronic disease risk.1 Taken collectively, these findings suggest that school breakfast may have some potential nutrition benefits for urban youth relative to eating break-fast at other locations.

The positive association of school breakfast with FV consumption is consistent with previous studies reporting that nutrient-dense foods such as cereal, milk, and FV, are among the breakfast foods most frequently con-sumed at school.9,27 In this study, the association was driven by children’s consumption of 100% fruit juice, which was difficult to interpret. On the one hand, concerns regarding exces-sive juice consumption led to recommendations to limit 100% fruit juice to 8–12 oz daily among chil-dren aged 7–18 years.28 On the other hand, 100% fruit juice represents only 28% to 33% of school-aged children’s total daily fruit intake,29 which is lower than recommended for many US children.30 Furthermore, a recent meta-analysis of prospective studies showed no associations of 100% fruit juice consumption with changes in body mass index among children aged 7–18 years.31 In light of these observa-tions, the current findings suggested that the provision of 100% fruit juice in the SBP makes beneficial contribu-tions to fruit intake among school-aged youth. However, SBP guidelines consider 100% fruit juice to be an ac-ceptable alternative to whole fruit. The extent to which the SBP can better promote whole FV intake is an im-portant nutritional issue that merits additional consideration.

The SBP guidelines allow for pro-cessed as well as whole-grain foods and do not require consumption of protein-rich foods such as meat and eggs.22 Reflecting those guidelines, this study found that consumption of muffins, donuts, and pastries was higher at school and that of break-fast sandwiches, eggs, and meat was lower at school than home. These findings indicated that the nutritional quality of school breakfast may not be superior to that of other locations in all regards and highlights areas for potential improvements in SBP regu-lations and offerings. Similarly, although children who ate at school were more likely to meet nutritional requirements outlined in the SBP, the percentage of children who met these guidelines was low. This finding sug-gested that children eat fewer of the meal components (eg, 1 FV, 1 grain, and 1 milk) than are provided and un-derscored the need to understand better the institutional, operational, and behavioral factors that encour-age healthy food choices at school.

Rates of skipping breakfast seen in this study were within the range of those seen in previous reports (12% to 34%).3,12 That fewer than half of chil-dren in this study ate school breakfast despite having a universal breakfast policy was also consistent with previ-ous studies documenting underuse of the SBP.9,32,33 Universal breakfast poli-cies do not appear to influence rates of breakfast skipping in elementary school.32 Furthermore, focus groups revealed that students and parents were wary of the SBP owing to the per-ceived low quality of foods served and social stigma.33 Results from this and other studies suggested that novel strategies are needed to address stigma and facilitate access to SBP, such as classroom breakfast programs.9,20,33

A number of limitations merit discussion. First, this research evaluated self-reported breakfast consumption on a single day; the extent to which these data reflect children’s usual intake at breakfast is unknown. Previous re-search also demonstrated that school-aged children often underreport food intake.34 This potential source of bias, however, was mitigated by the fact that children were surveyed shortly after breakfast and were asked only about single-meal. Second, information about portion sizes, the number of foods consumed within a given cate-gory, and nutrient content of foods was not assessed. Thus, these data cannot be used to infer nutrient intake. Third, analysis of high-SFAS foods did not include muffins, donuts, and pas-tries because healthier, low–saturated fat versions that met SBP guidelines were frequently served at the time of the study. That children were more likely to consume SFAS at school when this category was included is consis-tent with this observation, but it makes those results more difficult to inter-pret. Fourth, although the Breakfast Patterns Survey scale was developed for urban school-aged children, its psy-chometric characteristics are not well described.9,20 Finally, the cross-sectional study design does not permit causal inference.

IMPLICATIONS FOR RESEARCH AND PRACTICE
This research revealed positive associations of school breakfast with the quality of children’s breakfast choices. Eating school breakfast increased the odds of consuming fruit, lower-SFAS choices, and meeting nutritional re-quirements of the SBP relative to other locations. Eating school breakfast in-creased the odds of consuming FV and meeting nutritional requirements of the SBP regardless of whether chil-dren ate at other locations. The relatively low rates of SBP participation suggest a need for additional research to investigate innovative ap-proaches for promoting school breakfast. In an attempt to increase school breakfast participation, inno-vative interventions to promote school breakfast, such as classroom break-fast and grab-n-go carts, have been implemented.33,35 Finally, more re-search is needed regarding the quality of foods parents serve children for breakfast at home, as well as the role of corner stores and other retail loca-tions in shaping the quality of children’s breakfast consumption patterns.19,21,36
