        In this study, to preserve the quality of a fresh meal based on a mix of meatballs and semi-dry vegetables, two main strategies were combined: during process the meat before grinding was dipped in sodium lactate and during packaging different modified atmospheres were applied (30:70 CO2:N2, 70:30 CO2:O2, 5:5:90 O2:CO2:N2). The parameters monitored during the storage at 4&#xA0;&#xB0;C were the headspace gas composition, the microbial loads (Total viable count, Pseudomonas spp., lactic acid bacteria and Enterobacteriaceae), the pH and the sensory quality. Overall, the results indicate that the sodium lactate acted in synergy with MAP improving above all the microbial quality. A significant shelf life prolongation was obtained with 30&#xA0;% CO2 in the package, corresponding to a 168&#xA0;% shelf life increase compared to the control sample in air.
