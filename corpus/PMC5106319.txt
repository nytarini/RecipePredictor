To determine the prevalence and accuracy of patient-reported provider advice on
weight gain, physical activity, and nutrition during prenatal visits and to examine the
associations of provider advice with women’s behavioral intentions toward weight
gain, physical activity, and nutrition.

Methods
A mixed-methods study design was used to assess patient-report of provider
advice and health intentions in women between 20-30 weeks gestation (n=188). Bivariate
analyses examined patient-reported provider advice on weight gain, physical activity,
and nutrition with women’s behavioral intentions. Linear and logistic regression
models examined associations of provider weight gain recommendations with women’s
intended weight gain.

Results
Approximately 52% of women reported provider advice on weight gain, 63% on
physical activity, and 56% on nutrition. Of those who reported weight gain advice, 79%
cited provider recommendations within the Institute of Medicine guidelines, 9% below,
and 11% above. Patient-report of provider advice on physical activity and nutrition were
consistent with guidelines, but limited in scope. Provider advice (yes/no) was
significantly associated with women’s intentions to meet physical activity
(p=0.01) and nutrition (p=0.02), but not weight gain guidelines (p=0.86). Provider
recommended weight gain (pounds) was significantly associated with women’s
intended weight gain in linear and logistic regression models.

Conclusions for Practice
A large percentage of women report receiving no advice from providers on weight
gain, physical activity or nutrition during pregnancy. Of those who receive advice, most
report recommendations consistent with current guidelines. Provider advice was
associated with women’s weight gain, physical activity, and nutrition intentions
in pregnancy.

   Introduction
The Institute of Medicine (IOM) gestational weight gain guidelines were developed
to optimize health outcomes for mother and child (1).
However, the majority of women do not gain appropriate weight in pregnancy, with up to 50%
exceeding recommendations (2-4). Excessive pregnancy weight gain is associated with many adverse health
outcomes for both mother and child, including an increased risk of cesarean delivery,
postpartum weight retention, and future overweight and obesity in the child (3).

The American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists (ACOG) released a committee
opinion report in 2013, recommending that providers determine a woman’s body mass
index (BMI) at the initial prenatal visit, and counsel her on the benefits of appropriate
weight gain, physical activity, and nutrition, with emphasis placed on the need to limit
excessive weight gain to achieve optimal pregnancy outcomes (5). The implication of this report is that providers are well positioned to help
women gain appropriate weight in pregnancy. However, few studies have examined provider
compliance with the ACOG counseling recommendations, or the extent to which provider advice
influences women’s intended behaviors during pregnancy.

Evidence suggests that patient-provider communication on weight gain, physical
activity, and nutrition is inadequate in the prenatal care setting. Approximately 30-50% of
women report no advice from a provider on weight gain in pregnancy, and accuracy of reported
advice varies (6-11). Less is known about provider advice on physical activity or nutrition in
prenatal care. Qualitative studies have found that pregnant women receive limited advice on
physical activity and nutrition (12, 13). Women report that advice on physical activity is
generally vague and largely limited to being told to walk, while advice on dietary intake is
overwhelming, not individualized, and constantly changing (13). In light of the recent release of the ACOG committee opinion report, it is
important to reassess patient-provider communication on weight gain, physical activity, and
nutrition.

It is also important to assess if provider advice is associated with women’s
weight gain, physical activity, and nutrition intentions during pregnancy. Behavioral
intention is the strongest predictor of actual behavior across a variety of populations and
behaviors, including physical activity and healthy eating (14, 15), and intended pregnancy weight gain
is strongly associated with actual weight gain (7).
Limited research has examined provider weight gain advice with women’s intended or
actual pregnancy weight gain, with mixed results (6-8, 11, 16). To our knowledge, no studies have
examined associations of provider advice with pregnant women’s intentions to meet
physical activity or nutrition guidelines.

The current study aims to: (1) determine the
proportion of women who report provider advice on weight gain, physical activity, and
nutrition during prenatal care visits, (2) determine
the accuracy of patient-reported provider advice, and (3) examine if patient-reported provider advice is associated with women’s
intentions to meet the weight gain, physical activity, and nutrition (i.e. weight-related)
recommendations during pregnancy. We hypothesized that report of provider advice on weight
gain, physical activity, and nutrition would be associated with more favorable
weight-related intentions during pregnancy.

Materials and Methods
Participants were recruited through pregnancy-related Internet chat forums, blogs,
and social media sites from April-August 2014. Advertisements placed on websites (e.g.
babycenter.com, pregnantchicken.com, Facebook) included a brief description of the survey
with a link to access the screening form. Inclusion criteria were: 20-30 weeks pregnant,
18-44 years old, pre-pregnancy body mass index (BMI) between 18.5-45.0 kg/m2,
singleton pregnancy, and attended first prenatal visit before 16 weeks gestation. If
eligible, women were invited to complete an Internet-based survey to assess provider advice
on weight gain, physical activity, and nutrition and women’s intentions to meet the
respective behavioral recommendations. Participants had the option to enter their contact
information to enter into a drawing to win one of eight $50 Amazon gift cards. The
University of South Carolina Institutional Review Board approved all study protocols.

Report of Provider Advice
In three separate questions, women were asked if a health care provider
discussed weight gain, exercise, and nutrition with them during their current pregnancy
(yes/no for each). If women responded ‘yes’ to receiving weight gain advice,
they were asked to report how many pounds their provider recommended they gain (open-ended
response). The 2009 IOM guidelines were used to define whether providers’ advice
was below, within, or above these guidelines. If women reported advice on exercise or
nutrition, they were asked what recommendations were given for each outcome (open-ended
response).

Women’s Weight Gain, Physical Activity, and Nutrition Intentions
Weight gain intentions were assessed using two different methods. First, women
were asked to report how much total weight they plan on gaining during their pregnancy in
pounds (open-ended response). The 2009 IOM guidelines were used to define whether
women’s intended weight gain was below, within, or above these guidelines. Second,
intentions to meet the 2009 IOM weight gain guidelines were assessed with the statement
“I plan on gaining between [recommended weight gain range] total
pounds during this pregnancy,” using a seven-point Likert scale ranging from
−3 (strongly disagree) to 3 (strongly agree). The survey was designed to
automatically populate the recommended IOM weight gain range (i.e. 25-35, 15-25, or 11-20
pounds) (1) based on the woman’s
self-reported pre-pregnancy BMI. Report of provider recommended weight gain and
women’s intended weight gain in pounds were both assessed before informing women of
the recommended weight gain ranges to reduce social desirability bias.

Intentions to meet the guidelines for physical activity (17) and nutrition (18) were
assessed using the statements “I plan on exercising at a moderate intensity for 150
minutes per week (e.g. 30 minutes per day, 5 days per week) during my pregnancy,”
and “I plan on eating a healthy diet during my pregnancy,” using the same
seven-point Likert scale. Women first read a short description explaining the terms
‘moderate intensity’ (i.e., any activity that noticeably increases heart and
breathing rate, like brisk walking) and ‘healthy diet’ (i.e., including
plenty of fruits and vegetables, low fat dairy products, protein, fiber, and whole wheat
breads and pastas instead of refined grains like white bread, rice, and pasta, watching
portion sizes, and avoiding eating too much of very sugary and fatty food) before
answering these questions. Intentions were assessed using the score on the 1-item question
with a possible range of −3 to 3 for each health behavior. This scale is a
recommended and commonly used method for measuring behavioral intentions (19, 20). Higher
scores indicate stronger intentions to meet weight gain, physical activity, and nutrition
recommendations in pregnancy.

Personal history questionnaire
Self-reported height and pre-pregnancy weight were assessed and used to
calculate prepregnancy BMI. While underreporting of weight has been previously cited in
the literature, particularly among non-pregnant overweight and obese women (21), self-reported weight is the most commonly used
measure of pre-pregnancy weight. Furthermore, evidence suggests self-reported
pre-pregnancy weight during pregnancy is both reliable and valid (22, 23). Additional measures
included race, age, gestational age, highest grade or years of education, annual household
income, employment status, marital status, parity, smoking status before and during
pregnancy (every day, some days, not at all), and perceived health (excellent, very good,
good, or fair).

Qualitative Analyses
Responses from open-ended questions assessing women’s report of provider
advice on physical activity and nutrition were entered into NVivo 10 for computer-assisted
qualitative data management. A content analysis approach was used to identify common
recommendations for physical activity and nutrition (24). To increase the validity of the analysis, the first author (KW) and a
second rater independently read and coded the response data. Discussion and consensus
between the two raters guided the organization of the responses; frequencies and
percentages were estimated.

Statistical Analyses
Differences between those who reported provider advice and those who did not
were examined using t-tests, chi-square or fisher’s exact tests, as appropriate.
Bivariate associations between women’s report of provider advice on weight gain,
physical activity, or nutrition (yes/no for each) with women’s intentions
(seven-point Likert scale for each) were assessed using Wilcoxon Exact Tests. A
sub-analysis was conducted in those who responded ‘yes’ to weight gain
advice and then specified the amount of provider recommended weight gain. Linear
regression models examined associations between provider recommended weight gain in pounds
and women’s intended weight gain in pounds (continuous variables). Categorical
models initially assessed associations of provider recommended weight gain and
women’s intended weight gain (below, within, or above IOM guidelines for each). Due
to the small percentage of women who reported weight gain recommendations and weight gain
intentions below or above IOM guidelines, the model failed to converge and therefore we
further categorized recommendations and intentions as meeting or not meeting IOM
guidelines. All models controlled for maternal race, age, education, parity, and
pre-pregnancy BMI. All analyses were conducted using SAS version 9.3.

Results
Participant Characteristics
Of the 724 women who accessed the web-link, 549 completed the screening form and
197 women were excluded for the following reasons: not pregnant (n=20), first prenatal
visit after 16 weeks gestation (n=19), not between 20-30 weeks gestation (n=130), outside
the age range of 18-44 years (n=3), or body mass index outside inclusion criteria (n=25).
A total of 352 women were deemed eligible to participate (64.1%), and of which, 199 women
completed the survey (56.5%). Participants primarily resided in the U.S. (90.5%) and
Canada (7.5%). Those with IP addresses outside the U.S. or Canada (n=4), who did not
report a pre-pregnancy weight (n=1), or who later reported values inconsistent with
eligibility criteria (n=6) were excluded from analyses, resulting in a final sample of 188
women. When examining survey completion by U.S. geographical region, approximately 37% of
women resided in the South, 27% in the Midwest, 23% in the West, and 13% in the Northeast.
Participant characteristics are located in Table
1.

Report of Provider Advice
Approximately 52% of women reported provider advice on pregnancy weight gain,
63% on physical activity, and 56% on nutrition. As seen in Table 2, there were differences in provider advice by parity,
race, education, perceived health, and pre-pregnancy BMI. Nulliparous women were more
likely to report advice on weight gain and physical activity than multiparous women. White
women were more likely to report advice on physical activity than non-White women.
Physical activity advice was also associated with higher education, income, and rating of
perceived health. Obese women were more likely to report provider advice on nutrition,
followed by normal weight and overweight women.

When using the 2009 IOM guidelines to categorize provider weight gain advice,
79% of women reported provider recommendations within the guidelines, 9% below guidelines,
and 11% above guidelines (see Table
3). While not statistically significant, a higher percentage of normal
weight women reported advice within guidelines (86.7%), compared with overweight (64.3%)
and obese (64.8%) women.

Women’s report of provider advice on physical activity and nutrition are
summarized in Table 4. For physical
activity, women most commonly reported recommendations to continue their previous exercise
routine (36%). Providers also discussed type (32%), intensity (22%), and duration or
frequency of activity (21%). According to the FITT principle (i.e. frequency, intensity,
time, and type) of exercise (25), approximately 75%
of women reported one physical activity recommendation from their provider (e.g.
recommended walking as type of exercise), 17% reported two recommendations, and 8%
reported three. Overall, providers were encouraging of women to exercise during
pregnancy.

When listing nutrition recommendations, women reported provider advice to eat
plenty of fruits and vegetables (45%), increase protein intake (34%), and consume a
well-balanced or healthy diet (33%). Approximately 30% of women reported one dietary
recommendation from their provider, 34% reported two recommendations, and 38% reported
three or more recommendations. While advice on nutrition was limited in detail, 67% of
women reported rovider recommendations consistent with the USDA dietary guidelines for
pregnant women (18).

Women’s Intentions
Approximately 51% of women reported an intended weight gain within the IOM
guidelines, 29% below, and 20% above. Weight gain intentions differed by pre-pregnancy BMI
with overweight and obese women being more likely to report intended gains above IOM
guidelines, while normal weight women were more likely to report intended weight gain
below guidelines, χ2(4, N=188)=21.4, p&lt;0.001).

Bivariate Analyses of Provider Advice and Women’s Intentions
Women’s report of provider advice on physical activity and nutrition
(yes/no) was associated with women’s intentions (7-point Likert Scale) to meet the
guidelines for physical activity (p=0.007) and nutrition (p=0.025), but not weight gain
during pregnancy (p=0.860).

Multivariable Analyses of Provider Advice and Women’s Intentions
Women’s report of provider recommended weight gain in pounds was
significantly associated with women’s intended weight gain in pounds before and
after adjustment for race, age, education, parity, and pre-pregnancy BMI (β = 1.10,
p&lt;.001) (see Table 5). The
crude and adjusted odds ratios for women’s intended weight gain among those who
reported provider advice within or outside of IOM guidelines is presented in Table 6. After adjustment, women who reported
provider advice to gain less or more than the IOM guidelines were 6.68 (95% CI 1.87-23.94)
times more likely to report an intended weight gain outside guidelines as compared to
women who were advised to gain within the IOM guidelines.

Discussion
The first objective of this study was to assess the proportion of women reporting
provider advice on weight gain, physical activity, and nutrition during prenatal visits.
Approximately 52% of women reported advice on weight gain. This is largely consistent with
the existing literature (9-11), although some studies have reported counseling rates on pregnancy
weight gain closer to 70% (7, 8, 26). Of note, a large study of
U.S. Obstetricians and Gynecologists found that over 85% of providers report discussing
pregnancy weight gain with their patients (27),
indicating a discrepancy in perceptions. For physical activity and nutrition, 63% and 56% of
women reported provider advice, respectively. These findings are consistent with a study
conducted in the San Francisco Bay area in a diverse sample of women, where 65% reported
provider advice on exercise and 69% on nutrition (26).

We found multiple differences between those who reported advice on physical
activity and those who did not. Women who were less educated, lower income, non-White,
multiparous, and who reported poorer perceived health were less likely to report physical
activity advice. Lack of provider advice, particularly among less educated and lower income
women, may indicate differential counseling practices among providers. Alternately, this may
reflect a problem with patient-provider communication, where advice is not given in a way
that is meaningful or memorable. It is also possible that certain sub-groups are more likely
to ask about physical activity, and therefore providers are prompted to initiate these
discussions. The lower rate of physical activity advice reported by Non-White women is
concerning as many ethnic minority populations are less active and experience obesity at
greater rates than White women (28, 29).

The second objective of this study was to determine the accuracy of provider
advice on weight gain, physical activity, and nutrition. Nearly 80% of women who received
advice on weight gain reported provider recommendations within IOM guidelines. This is a
higher percentage than previously found in the literature (8, 10), with the exception of a study
published by Phelan and colleagues where 85% of women reported accurate provider advice
(9). These findings may indicate that the IOM
guidelines are becoming more widely known and utilized among prenatal care providers, or may
reflect sampling differences.

When examining specific recommendations for physical activity, pregnant women
generally reported that providers encouraged them to be active. However, few women recalled
provider advice that described the duration, frequency, and intensity needed to meet current
physical activity recommendations. These findings may indicate that some healthcare
providers lack knowledge about the current physical activity recommendations for women in
pregnancy, or do not advise women in such a way that they accurately recall
recommendations.

Nutrition recommendations included advice consistent with the USDA dietary
guidelines for pregnant women; however, there was a general lack of detail in participant
report of provider advice. Nearly one-third of women simply reported provider
recommendations to “eat healthy.” It is unclear if women received insufficient
information from their providers or if detailed advice was provided and simply not reported
in this survey. Future studies should match patients and providers in the prenatal care
setting in order to directly compare report of advice across health behaviors. Qualitative
study designs would also allow for further probing on the content of patient-provider
communication.

While not a primary objective of this study, it is worth noting that only 50% of
women reported an intended weight gain within IOM guidelines. Among normal weight women,
almost 40% stated an intended weight gain below guidelines. While weight gain below
recommendations poses little risk to the mother, moderate to strong evidence suggests an
association between inadequate weight gain and preterm delivery, low birth weight, small for
gestational age infants, and failure to initiate breastfeeding (30). Among overweight and obese women, 28% and 35% reported an intended
weight gain above guidelines, respectively. Excessive pregnancy weight gain is also
associated with many adverse health outcomes for both mother and child (31). It is critical that women and their health care
providers understand the risks of both insufficient and excessive weight gain during
pregnancy, and that providers clearly communicate these risks to their patients.

The final objective of this study was to examine if provider advice on weight
gain, physical activity, and nutrition was associated with women’s intentions to meet
respective recommendations. Supporting our hypothesis, we found significant associations
between report of provider advice and women’s intentions to meet physical activity
and nutrition recommendations. Report of provider advice on weight gain was not associated
with weight gain intentions in bivariate analyses. However, the amount of weight gain
recommended by providers was associated with women’s intended weight gain in pounds.
Furthermore, provider recommendations to gain weight outside of IOM guidelines were
associated with an increased risk of intended weight gain outside of guidelines. Due to the
small sample size we observed wide confidence intervals and therefore findings must be
interpreted with caution. Together, these findings illustrate the potential role of the
health care provider in guiding women’s intentions to meet weight gain, physical
activity, and nutrition recommendations.

Although healthcare providers are well positioned to discuss weight-related
behaviors in pregnancy, there are also many barriers to patient-provider communication,
including: lack of time, insufficient training, concern about the sensitivity of the topic,
and the perception that advice is ineffective (32-34). If providers are to consistently
and correctly advise patients, they must be given the appropriate intervention tools. Future
studies should examine the efficacy of provider-based interventions aimed at increasing the
rate and accuracy of provider counseling on weight gain, physical activity, and
nutrition.

This study contributes to the existing literature in multiple ways. Assessment of
patient-provider communication on physical activity and nutrition during prenatal care fills
an existing gap in the literature. Furthermore, to our knowledge this is the first study to
quantitatively examine the associations of provider advice on physical activity and
nutrition with women’s intentions to meet nutrition and physical activity
recommendations. Findings provide evidence that healthcare providers influence
women’s weight-related intentions during pregnancy. However, further education and
training for providers is needed to increase the percentage who discuss these topics and who
do so accurately.

While this study contributes novel findings to the literature, multiple
limitations must be noted. First, pre-pregnancy weight was self-reported and underreporting
of weight may have occurred. This could have resulted in misclassification of pre-pregnancy
BMI and therefore the weight recommendations populated in the survey would have been
incorrect. Second, we used women’s self-report of provider behavior and did not
include provider assessments. Recall or social desirability bias may have led women to
inaccurately report weight gain, physical activity, and dietary recommendations. Future
studies should consider assessing patient report of provider advice early on and throughout
pregnancy to limit recall bias. Furthermore, the study design did not allow for probing and
follow up questions, which may have limited the depth of responses on physical activity and
nutrition recommendations. However, in a different sample population, we found high levels
of consistency between patient and provider report of counseling on weight gain, physical
activity, and nutrition (34). Third, we did not
assess women’s actual pregnancy weight gain, physical activity, or dietary intake
during pregnancy, but rather focused on women’s intentions to engage in these
behaviors. Studies are needed that women over time to see if provider advice is associated
with women’s weight-related behaviors during pregnancy. Finally, respondents were
primarily White Internet-users with higher levels of education and income and lower mean BMI
than national averages, which limit the generalizability of study findings.

Overall rates of patient-reported provider advice on weight gain, physical
activity, and nutrition are less than ideal. However, when advice is reported it is largely
consistent with current guidelines. It appears that providers may play an important role in
guiding women’s weight gain, physical activity, and nutrition intentions in
pregnancy. It is imperative that providers are knowledgeable about current guidelines.
Interventions are needed to increase the percentage of healthcare providers who accurately
advise women on weight gain and related behaviors during pregnancy.

Significance
Weight gain, physical activity, and dietary intake all directly influence pregnancy
outcomes and the health of mother and child. Providers are encouraged to discuss weight gain
and related behaviors with pregnant patients; however, evidence suggests that provider
advice is limited. In this study, a large percentage of women reported receiving no advice
on weight gain, physical activity, or nutrition during pregnancy. However, report of
provider recommendations was associated with women’s intentions to engage in healthy
weight-related behaviors. Further education and training of providers is necessary to
increase communication on weight gain, physical activity, and nutrition during
pregnancy.
