iving in Korea have contributed to an
increased focus on personal health (Lee et al.,
2018). Korean&#x2019;s diets, food preferences, and consumption patterns
are highly dependent on nutritional information, which is a crucial factor in a
healthy lifestyle. Koreans tend to select healthier processed meats when given the
opportunity (Kim, 2011). Consumers recognize
there are other high-quality protein sources in addition to meats and processed
meats (Chung et al., 2018).
      In Korea, the annual per capita consumption of chicken has increased from 5.98 kg in
1995 to 13.8 kg in 2016, and further increases are expected (Korea Meat Trade Association [KMTA], 2016). In 2017, chicken
meat (13.3 kg) was the second most highly preferred and consumed meat in Korea after
pork (24.5 kg) (Ministry of Agriculture Food and Rural Affairs, 2018). Recently
there has been an increase in the consumption of portion cuts of meat, including
breast, thigh, wing, and drumstick, as opposed to whole chickens. Korean consumers
prefer the tender cuts of chicken, such as the legs and wings rather than the drier
breasts. Preferences for particular cuts of chicken have considerable influence on
imports. The number of chicken legs and wings imported (100,596 tons) was
substantially higher than the number of chicken breasts imported (1,966 tons) (KMTA, 2016). Producers have attempted to
physically and chemically modify chicken breast meat (CBM) to align with consumer
preferences through tumbling, massaging, marinating, and curing by injection (Alvarado and McKee, 2007). CBM has generally
been ground and used to make sausages or reconstructed ham. CBM consists of white
muscle containing ~2% fat and ~20% protein, and fewer calories (109
kcal) than other meat and meat portion sources (Barbanti and Pasquini, 2005). CBM products are economically and
industrially favorable. However, dryness and blandness have reduced consumer
acceptance.
      Whey protein (WP) is a nutritious soluble protein consisting of &#x3B1;-lactalbumin
and &#x3B2;-lactoglobulin. It is a source of amino acids and performs a regulatory
function as a biological reagent (Renner and
Abd-EL-Salam, 1991; Moon and Jung,
2010). WP is used to increase the emulsification, solubility, bubble
formation, water holding capacity (WHC), gelatinization, and viscosity of various
foods, including meat products. Furthermore, WP can decrease the shear force and
modify texture (Tungland and Meyer, 2002). WP
has been added to processed meats (Cofrades et al,
2000), fermented foods, and functional foods (Kulmyrzaev et al., 2000; Moon,
2006) and is utilized to improve the overall quality of processed meats,
reconstructed meats, coarse ground meats, comminuted meats, low-fat meats, and
surimi (Youssef and Barbut, 2010). However,
there are few studies on the effects of WP injection into meats as a curing
solution, and its contribution to the overall quality and storage stability of CBM.
This study was designed to investigate the quality and storage stability of CBM
injected with WP. The data from this study will provide basic information for the
development of CBM-based products that meet consumer needs.

      Materials and Methods

        Formulation and processing procedure
        The five different CBM formulations used are provided in Table 1. Fifty 28-d-old Ross CBMs were purchased from
Cheongam Food (Jeungpyeong, Korea) and trimmed to remove the skin, visible fat,
and fascia. The CBMs were weighed and injected with a 30% curing solution
(w/w) containing WP (Agri-mark Inc., Andover, ME, USA) using an injector
(LJZ02-2, Leeseph, Beijing, China). Curing solutions were prepared with various
concentrations of WP [0% (control), 1% (WP1), 3% (WP3),
5% (WP5), and 7% (WP7); w/w; n=10]. Each group was analyzed
for the experiments after vacuum-packing and storage at 4&#xB0;C for 24 hours.
All the data was reported as a mean with standard deviation.

              C, no WP added control; WP1, WP3, WP5, and WP7, added 1%,
3%, 5%, and 7% of WP.

        Proximate composition
        Moisture, protein, fat, and ash contents of the CBM were assessed according to
standard method (AOAC, 2012; Bae et al., 2019).

        pH
        Ten grams of each CBM sample was dissolved in 100 mL of distilled water and
homogenized using a Stomacher (400 Lab blender, Seward, London, UK). The pH
values were recorded using a standardized pH meter (WTW pH 720, Weilheim,
Germany).

        Meat color and water holding capacity (WHC)
        The color and WHC of the CBM was assessed by a previously described methods
(Bae et al., 2019).

        Cooking and drip loss
        Each CBM sample (approximately 4 cm cube) was vacuum-packed into a polypropylene
bag and cooked in a water bath at 70&#xB0;C for 40 min and cooled down to room
temperature for 30 min to determine the cooking loss (%). The cooking
loss (%) was determined by the following equation: [(initial CBM sample
weight&#x2212;CBM weight after cooking)/initial CBM sample weight]&#xD7;100.
To determine the drip loss (%), the vacuumed-packed CBM samples were
refrigerated for 1 day. The drip loss (%) was determined by the following
equation: [(initial CBM sample weight&#x2212;CBM weight after storage)/initial
CBM sample weight]&#xD7;100.

        Texture profile analysis (TPA)
        For the TPA analysis, each CBM sample was cooked and cooled as described in
cooking loss. TPA values were determined from the minced approximately 1 cm
cubes using a rheometer (Sun Scientific Co., Tokyo, Japan, with Rheology data
systems version 3.0 for Windows) using a constant table speed (60 mm/min) and 2
kg maximum load cell capacity.

        Volatile basic nitrogen (VBN), 2-thiobarbituric acid reactive substances
(TBARS) and total microbial count (TMB)
        The VBN, TBARS and TMB values were measured using a set of standardized in-house
experimental methods (Bae et al.,
2019).

        Statistical analysis
        The data were tested by analysis of variance using the SAS program (2012) with the general linear model, and the
difference between samples were analyzed using Duncan's multiple range test.

      Results and Discussion

        Proximate analysis
        The proximate analysis results of the CBM according to the WP injection
concentration are presented in Table 2.
The moisture content of the CBM samples with WP injection was
77.54%&#x2013;78.26%. The water content decreased with increasing
concentration of WP injected (WP1, WP5 and WP7), with the lowest water content
observed when 7% WP (WP7) was injected. This result is expected because
the water content in formulation was decreased by increase of WP percentage. A
previous study also showed that increased WP addition into meatballs reduced the
moisture content (Serdaroglu, 2006). The
protein content was significantly increased in the WP7-treated CBM. Hughes et al. (1998) also observed that WP
addition increased the protein content in Frankfurter sausages. The fat content
of the CBM samples decreased significantly when the WP injection exceeded
5% (WP5 and WP7). The ash content of the control and WP-treated groups
ranged from 0.98 to 1.30, and there was no statistical difference between the
control and treatment groups. Injection of curing solutions containing WP
increased the amount of protein in CBM. WP consists of various proteins such as
&#x3B1;-lactalbumin, &#x3B2;-lactoglobulin, serum albumin and immunoglobulin
(Farrell et al., 2004). Although
leaner meat is generally preferred, some countries such as Korea and Japan are
not (Ngapo et al., 2007). Therefore, a
sensory evaluation study may necessary to understand the acceptability, flavor,
taste and other characteristics of WP-injected CBM containing higher
protein.

        Quality characteristics
        The quality characteristics of CBM according to WP injection are summarized in
Table 3. The injection of WP into CBM
significantly increased the pH value regardless of the concentration of injected
WP; WP3 and WP7 displayed the highest pH. In a previous supportive study, the pH
of turkey breast meat was also elevated upon the addition of different
concentrations of WP (Sammel and Claus,
2003). WP is a surface-active globular protein that enhances WHC,
gelatinization, and emulsification, and has the potential to stabilize lipid
globules in food (Huffman, 1996; Sammel and Claus, 2003; Sun et al., 2007). The calculated WHC
ranged from 58.52 (control) to 62.73 in CBM. The WHC was significantly increased
when CBM contained over 3% WP (WP3, WP5, and WP7). Moreover, the
injection of WP into CBM dramatically decreased the level of cooking loss when
the concentration of WP injected was higher than 3% (WP3, WP5, and WP7).
The drip loss in control and WP-injected CBM ranged from 1.26 to 1.33, which was
not statistically different regardless of WP injection percentage. The pH level
is an excellent indicator of the potential meat quality during meat processing.
An increase in the pH in meat influences the texture profile and meat color by
improving WHC. Consequently, the sensory evaluation of the meat and the meat
quality may be potentially affected by characteristics such as lipid oxidation
or protein degradation. The increase in pH and the gel-forming ability that
occurs upon addition of WP (Lazidis et al.,
2016) is considered to improve the WHC and, thus, possibly reduces
cooking loss in CBM. In a previous study, the pH of turkey breast meat was
elevated by the addition of different concentrations of WP (Sammel and Claus, 2003). In addition, Serdaroglu and Ozsumer (2003) also reported
similar observations in a study using meatballs.

              C, no WP added control; WP1, WP3, WP5, and WP7, added 1%,

        Instrumental color and pigment determination
        The color of WP-treated CBM are presented in Table 4. The lightness value (L*) was higher (brighter) in all
WP-injected groups than in the control. However, there was no difference in L*
among the different concentrations of WP. The a* decreased in a dose-dependent
manner with the injection of WP to CBM. The b* decreased significantly when over
5% WP was added to CBM. Our experimental findings support an earlier
study which demonstrated that WP addition to beef or pork Frankfurter sausage
increased L* but decreased a* (Atughonu et al.,
1998). Another study reported that WP addition to meat products did
not affect the b* (Serdaroglu et al.,
2006). However, presently the b* gradually decreased as the WP
concentration in CBM increased. A previous study (Andres et al., 2006) compared the meat color in CBM sausage with
addition of 0.64% and 1.94% WP. While previous studies
demonstrated no significant differences in the brightness and the redness,
1.94% WP significantly increased the yellowness in comparison with
0.64% WP group. These results also support our experimental findings.
Moreover, Youssef and Barbut (2010)
showed that the addition of 1.5% WP significantly increased the
brightness and decreased the redness of the meat while simultaneously increasing
the hardness of meat (Atughonu et al.,
1998).

        Texture profile analysis (TPA)
        TPA data (springiness, cohesiveness, chewiness, and hardness) after WP injection
are presented in Table 5. The springiness
was markedly elevated in all the CBM groups injected with WP
(52.05&#x2013;55.22) compared to the control (44.10). Cohesiveness and chewiness
were enhanced in WP1 and WP5 compared to the control, but that of the WP3 and
WP7 was similar to the control. We observed a trend of reduction in hardness
with an increase in the concentration of the WP injected into CBM
(1.03&#x2013;1.20) compared to the control (1.43). Up to 3% WP (WP1 and
WP3) injected into CBM considerably decreased the hardness compared to the
control. WP is widely accepted as a texture-enhancing additive (Andres et al., 2006; Holland, 1984; Shie,
2004), and it has been reported that WP addition attenuates the
hardness and chewiness but elevates the cohesiveness in sausages. Taken
together, the introduction of WP into meat contributes to the formation of solid
texture of the meat emulsion due to the alteration of gel-forming ability.
However, the hardness of CBM significantly decreased after WP injection, which
may imply that WP is retained in the moisture in CBM and can enhance the
tenderness of the meat.

        Storage stability
        The storage characteristics of CBM based on the concentration of WP injection are
shown in Table 6. The TBARS value on day
0 ranged from 0.11 to 0.15 mg malondialdehyde/kg meat protein with the WP3 group
showing the highest value and WP1 showing the lowest
(WP3&gt;WP7&gt;C=WP5&gt;WP1). The TBARS value on day 3 was
higher than that on day 0, with WP7 (0.46 mg malondialdehyde/kg meat protein)
and WP5 (0.33 mg malondialdehyde/kg meat protein) showing higher TBARS values
than the control (0.20 mg malondialdehyde/kg meat protein). The TBARS value on
day 7 was also increased, and all the WP-treated CBM had higher TBARS values
(0.28&#x2013;0.46 mg malondialdehyde/kg meat protein) than the control (0.25 mg
malondialdehyde/kg meat protein). The initial storage VBN value on day 0 was
higher in WP5 (10.98) than WP1 (9.79). The VBN values, expressed as mg/100 g,
were significantly higher for all WP-injected CBM than the control on day 3 and
7 after storage. In the control group, the VBN values were 17.11 and 14.55
mg/100 g on day 3 and 7 after storage, respectively. In the WP-injected groups,
the VBN values ranged between 18.62&#x2013;23.28 mg/100 g (on day 3 of storage),
and between 20.63&#x2013;26.95 mg/100 g (on day 7 of storage), respectively. The
guidelines from the Ministry of Food and Drug
Safety (2002) state that the VBN content should be maintained below
20 mg/100 g, but the WP injection exceeded this limit. Cresopo et al. (1978) reported that, during storage, food
proteins were degraded into smaller amino acids and produced inorganic nitrogen.
In general, the VBN in fresh meat should be under 10&#x2013;20 mg/100 g, and it
is thought that early spoilage can change these values to 30&#x2013;40 mg/100 g.
Total microbial count (TMC) was higher in the WP-injected CBM than in the
control initially and 3 days after storage. The TMC values for the control were
3.61 and 4.45 log colony forming units (CFU)/g on day 0 and day 3 after storage,
respectively. In the WP-injected groups, the TMC values ranged between
5.46&#x2013;5.76 Log CFU/g at initial storage and 6.94&#x2013;7.49 Log CFU/g at
3 days after storage, respectively. The TMC values on day 7 after storage ranged
between 6.8 Log CFU/g (WP5) and 7.23 Log CFU/g (WP7); the TMC value was
significantly lower in WP5 than in WP3 and WP7. Lamkey et al. (1991), who reported that TMC values higher than 8 Log
CFU/g indicated that the meat was in the spoilage stage caused by microbial
activities.

              C, no WP added control; WP1, WP3, WP5, and WP7, added 1%,
3%, 5%, and 7% of WP; TBARS, 2-thiobarbituric
acid reactive substances; VBN, volatile basic nitrogen; TMC, total
microbial count.

        Rajesh Kumar et al. (2007) reported that
the addition of 20% WP into pork nuggets instead of water resulted in
very low values of TBARS during a 28 day storage period. This observation
reflected that the protein and lactose content of WP that can lead to the
formation of antioxidants due the Maillard reaction upon heating (Pena-Ramos and Xiong, 2001). In addition,
Pena-Ramos and Xiong (2003) reported
that the addition of 2% WP into pork patty resulted in higher
antioxidative activity compared to the control. However, WP injection in our
study did not alter the antioxidative activity since WP was an extracted protein
product.
        Meat protein decomposes during storage due to microorganism- or enzyme-dependent
breakdown. The VBN content is an important indicator to evaluate the freshness
of meat or meat products. There was no difference in the VBN content between the
control and WP-injected groups after the initial storage. However, after
refrigeration, the VBN content increased markedly compared to control group on
day 3 and 7. Hence, WP may play a role in protein decomposition of CBM, since
WP-injected CBM had high concentrations of proteins such as
&#x3B1;-lactalbumin, &#x3B2;-lactoglobulin, serum albumin, and immunoglobulin.
In addition, the values of the total TMC were higher in WP-injected CBM than in
the control CBM due to the proliferation of microorganisms-produced metabolites
during storage. On the other hand, WP injected-groups showed higher level of the
initial TMC, because WP may possess probiotics or other beneficial
microorganisms.

      Conclusion
      The collective results indicate that the injection of WP-containing curing solution
into CBM enhances WHC and textural quality. However, it may have negative effects on
the storage properties. Further studies are needed to overcome the limitation of WP
in storage stability, which is important for its industrial usage. Natural
components, such as spices and herbs, have strong antimicrobial activity (Bae et al., 2019; Holley and Patel, 2005). Their addition to the WP solution may
help alleviate the storage issue in WP-injected CBM.
