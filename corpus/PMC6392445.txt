   Since the earliest reports describing a connection between the α-Gal syndrome and tick bites it has been clear that the prevalence of IgE sensitization to galactose-α-1,3-galactose (α-Gal) in some regions and select populations is ≥ 10%, with population estimates of ~20% in studies from VA, NC, and TN1–3. The question of the prevalence of cases of bona fide α-Gal syndrome (ie, subjects who manifest allergic symptoms upon ingestion of mammalian meat or innards), on the other hand, has not been investigated in the U.S. The best evidence comes from the work of Fischer et al. who assessed a high-risk population of 300 hunters and forest workers in southwest Germany and determined that only 8.6% of those who were sensitized (at an α-Gal specific IgE cut-off of ≥0.35 IU/mL) had clinical histories or allergic reactions to mammalian meat3. Although this finding warrants additional investigation, it suggests the possibility that the majority of subjects with detectable IgE to α-Gal are not clinically ‘allergic’. This is not different from other food allergies as practicing clinicians are often faced with the dilemma of making sense of positive specific IgE (sIgE) blood tests with a negative or indeterminate clinical history. Further complicating matters, because the α-Gal syndrome has a characteristic delay between ingestion and symptom onset of 3-6 hours, conducting oral food challenges with red meat in clinic presents significant challenges (and potentially risks).

On this backdrop Mehlich et al. set out to determine whether the basophil activation test (BAT) could provide a useful tool to discriminate between subjects who had α-Gal syndrome (n=21) and those who were sensitized to α-Gal but tolerated mammalian products (n=12)4. As previously described, basophil activation reflects a number of biologic variables that are not necessarily accounted for by serum IgE testing5. The approach taken in the present report was to isolate and stimulate PBMCs with a panel of different α-Gal containing proteins or foods (eg, pork kidney), and to assess by flow cytometry the % of basophils that were positive for the surface activation marker CD63 (positive cut-off &gt;15%) (see
Fig). An additional metric included a ratio calculated based on the % of basophils activated with α-Gal exposure as compared to the % activated by anti-FcεR1 antibody treatment. Several test conditions performed well for discriminating between the two populations and achieved an area under the curve (AUC) in receiver-operator characteristic (ROC) analysis of 0.95, which exceeded the AUC of 0.78 for α-Gal sIgE testing. The authors conclude that BAT could be a tool for clinicians to stratify allergy risk and inform decision-making amongst α-Gal sensitized patients with indeterminate history.

BAT could indeed hold promise in the future, though there are several caveats worth considering. In contrast to skin testing or serum sIgE testing, BAT is not readily available to most practicing allergists. Moreover, implementing BAT outside of research settings also introduces questions about reproducibility and cost that have not been satisfactorily addressed to date. In addition, it is not clear that the performance characteristics of BAT in this cohort, which only included 26 subjects in the final analysis (of 33 enrolled), are sufficiently superior to warrant their implementation in a clinical setting. Despite the high AUC reported for the BAT, it seems unlikely there is a single cut-point that is both highly sensitive and highly specific for predicting which subjects that are sensitized to α-Gal are clinically allergic (a feature that is shared by skin testing and serum IgE testing). For example, pork-kidney stimulation at 0.227 ng/mL, which was one of the optimal-performing BAT conditions (AUC 0.95), was positive in 57% of subjects with α-Gal syndrome and 0% of the sensitized group (using 15% basophil positivity as the cut-point). By contrast, intra-cutaneous skin testing with a commercial gelatin preparation (4% gelafundin) was positive in 93% of subjects with α-Gal syndrome, but only 13% of the sensitized but asymptomatic subjects. Thus, the intra-cutaneous skin test had greater sensitivity but only a modest loss in specificity compared to the BAT. A similar result to the intra-cutaneous testing was revealed with serum sIgE testing by calculating % α-Gal sIgE in relation to total IgE using a cut-off of 3% α-Gal sIgE (90% vs 17%). Nonetheless, a real strength of the work by Mehlich et al. is the head-to-head comparison of different testing modalities in a well-defined patient population.

A further caveat to consider relates to the possibility that IgE sensitization to α-Gal could have health risks that extend beyond anaphylaxis. This stems from a recent report demonstrating an association between sIgE to α-Gal and coronary artery disease6. Although the cohort was small and there are currently no mechanistic studies to support the observation, the association is biologically plausible. A working model to explain the connection proposes that chronic ingestion of mammalian products in subjects who are sensitized to α-Gal could contribute to persistent low-grade inflammation in the walls of coronary arteries. Although the data are currently insufficient to make recommendations for changing clinical practice, this study has given us pause in thinking about the advice we give to our α-Gal-sensitized patients about diet, particularly those that have established risk factors for heart disease.

Beyond the possible clinical merits of BAT, perhaps the greatest contribution of the current report relates to insights into the biology of α-Gal that are suggested. Previously it has been proposed that differences in gut microbiota, gut barrier function or systemic metabolism could explain why some subjects who are sensitized to α-Gal react clinically to mammalian products but others do not7. Although the current work does not preclude those possibilities, it is interesting that subjects with α-Gal syndrome had significantly higher tryptase levels as well as baseline basophil activation. This suggests that some of the differences between responders and non-responders could be accounted for by differences in the intrinsic activation of allergic effector cells (ie, mast cells and basophils), a possibility that would be consistent with the recent report by Carter et al8. It is also important not to discount the effects that sIgE titer or affinity could be playing. After all, subjects with α-Gal syndrome had significantly higher titers on serum testing in this cohort. Conducting BAT with a passive sensitization technique could be another way to approach this. It is also important to recall that an ex vivo BAT study has already provided important mechanistic evidence that support the characteristic delay of 3-6 hours that is observed clinically9 (see
Fig).

Taken together, although basophil activation testing has the potential to be a useful tool in clinical practice, to date BAT has played a more important role in addressing questions regarding the immune mechanisms that contribute to hypersensitivity reactions. This has been particularly true in the case of the α-Gal syndrome, a food allergy with several unusual features. It is clear that BAT, but also mast cell activation testing, will provide additional insights in the future10.

Figure. Three forms of basophil activation tests. A, The current report demonstrated that basophil activation can occur rapidly with in vitro stimulation by α-Gal bearing foods or proteins. Basophil activation was greater in subjects with α-Gal syndrome than in subjects who were sensitized but tolerated mammalian products. Importantly, baseline levels of basophil activation, as assessed by cell surface expression of CD63, were also higher in subjects with α-Gal syndrome. B, The ex vivo test demonstrated that the activation of basophils in subjects with α-Gal syndrome occurs after challenge with similar kinetics as the characteristic delay of 3-6 hours that is observed clinically. C, Possible experiment using passively sensitized basophils. In this approach basophils from an unrelated donor are isolated, stripped of surface-bound antibodies by an acid-treatment step, and serum from a patient is incubated and allowed to bind to the basophils. Compared to model A, this approach would provide information about the role of serum constituents (ie, IgE and IgE antibodies) versus the intrinsic properties of allergic effector cells (ie, basophils) in determining clinical reactivity in subjects who are sensitized to α-Gal.
