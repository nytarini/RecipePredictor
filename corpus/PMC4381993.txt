A reduction in glycogen after the switch to an isoenergetic high-fat diet might promote a compensatory increase in food intake in order to reestablish carbohydrate balance. We assessed the effect of an isoenergetic switch from a 49%-carbohydrate to 50%-fat diet on nutrient balance and ad-libitum food intake. We hypothesized that carbohydrate balance would be inversely related to ad-libitum energy intake.

Methods
In 47 males and 11 females (22.6 ± 0.4 y; 26.1 ± 0.5 kg/m2), fuel balance was measured in a respiration chamber over 4 days. During the first day, an isoenergetic, high-carbohydrate diet was provided followed by a 3-day isoenergetic, high-fat diet. At the end of this period and after 16 hours of fasting, three options of foods (cookies, fruit salad and turkey sandwich) were offered ad-libitum for 4 hours. The relationships between post-chamber ad-libitum intake and macronutrient oxidation and balance measured day-to-day and over the 4-day respiration chamber stay were studied.

Results
After switching to a high-fat diet, 24-h respiratory quotient decreased from 0.87 ± 0.02 to 0.83 ± 0.02 (p&lt;0.0001) resulting in a 4-d cumulative carbohydrate, fat and protein balances of −183 ± 368, 342 ± 480 and 65 ± 267 kcal, respectively. Cumulative energy balance (224 ± 362 kcal/4 d) did not influence ad-libitum energy intake. However, we detected that 4-d carbohydrate balance was a positive and independent predictor of post-chamber ad-libitum energy intake (R2=0.10; p=0.01), whereas no significant influence of fat and protein balances was found.

Conclusion
In response to an isoenergetic change from a high-carbohydrate to high-fat diet, higher carbohydrate balance related to increased energy intake.

   Introduction
Carbohydrate balance has been implicated in the regulation of food intake in animals and humans (1, 2). Decreased carbohydrate intake or increased carbohydrate oxidation will rapidly affect carbohydrate stores, because the balance between the amount of carbohydrate oxidized and ingested in a day is equivalent to the amount of carbohydrate stored. In mice, one day’s carbohydrate balance predicts ad-libitum food intake during the subsequent day (2). This observation supported Flatt’s hypothesis that weight maintenance can be achieved by a regulation of food intake geared primarily toward the maintenance of stable carbohydrate stores (2). In humans, the manipulation of carbohydrate stores shows controversial results. Some studies have shown no effect on energy intake (3–5); whereas, increased energy intake after lowering carbohydrate store has also been reported (6, 7). In line with these latter studies, lower carbohydrate balance measured over three days under weight maintenance conditions predicted increased energy intake (8). Lack of consistency in human studies might be due to small sample sizes used in most of the studies (n = 8 – 9), the type of foods provided when individuals were allowed to eat ad-libitum, duration of the intervention or differences in multiple hedonic stimulus which can override metabolic regulation. In contrast to findings from short-term studies, long-term studies seem to be more consistent. Eckel et al. (9) found that subjects having higher carbohydrate balance after a 14-day high-carbohydrate diet gained less weight and fat mass after 4 years of follow-up. Similarly, high 24-h carbohydrate oxidation that may lead to reduced carbohydrate stores is a predictor of prospective weight gain in humans (10). Additionally, insulin sensitivity is also a significant predictor of weight gain (11). It is known that glucose oxidation during a hyperinsulinemic clamp is higher in those individuals having greater insulin sensitivity (12), which could decrease carbohydrate stores and then promote increased energy intake and subsequent higher weight gain. Altogether, this evidence suggests that the size of carbohydrate stores may regulate weight gain.

Acutely, isoenergetic low-carbohydrate, high-fat diets lead to decreased carbohydrate balance (13, 14). This scenario might be particularly important in individuals with impaired ability to up-regulate fat oxidation or down-regulate carbohydrate oxidation leading to sustained carbohydrate oxidation and decreased carbohydrate balance. Our goal was to evaluate the metabolic adaptation to a 3-day isoenergetic high-fat diet and its influence on ad-libitum energy intake in humans. We hypothesized that carbohydrate balance would be inversely related to ad-libitum energy intake.

Methods
Subjects
Fifty eight (47 males and 11 females) young, non-smoking volunteers were recruited by public advertising. They were healthy as indicated by physical examination and routine medical laboratory tests (Table 1). They had a change in body weight of less than 2 kg over the preceding 6 months. Women were asked to participate in the follicular phase of the menstrual cycle as determined by menstrual history. All subjects provided written informed consent prior to their study participation.

Experimental design
This paper reports on a project called ADAPT study which is a short-term, cross-sectional interventional study designed to examine inter-individual differences in fat oxidation on an isoenergetic high-fat diet (HFD). The protocol was approved by the Institutional Review Board of the Pennington Biomedical Research Center.

After completing the screening process, participants presented at the Pennington Center In-Patient Unit three days before entering the respiration chamber and ate for 3 days a weight-maintaining diet consisting of 49% carbohydrate, 35% fat and 16% protein. If completely oxidized this diet would produce a carbon dioxide produced to oxygen used ratio (VCO2/VO2) of 0.87, which is called the Food Quotient (FQ). A euglycemic-hyperinsulinemic clamp was performed the day before entering the respiration chamber. During the first day in the respiration chamber, participants consumed the same weight-maintaining diet. However, energy intake was decreased by 15% to account for the decrease in activity due to confinement. Then, for 3 days they were fed an isoenergetic HFD consisting of 50% fat, 34% carbohydrate and 16% protein (FQ = 0.83). Total daily energy expenditure, fat oxidation, protein oxidation, and carbohydrate oxidation were measured at energy balance using an algorithm to balance intake and expenditure within the day as previously described (15). Briefly, free-living energy intake was estimated from free-living energy expenditure determined by accelerometer (RT3 monitor. Microlife Inc, Dunedin, FL). The 24-h energy expenditure was predicted after 3 h and 7 h of respiration chamber assessment. If the difference between predicted 24-h energy expenditure after 7 h was 100 kcal/d higher or lower than the prescribed energy intake, energy intake was adjusted by adding or taking out unit muffins. Each unit muffin contained 100 kcal and was composed of the same macronutrient composition as the test diet. After exiting the chamber on the fourth day, volunteers were required to stay on the inpatient unit for 4 more hours while staying fasted, after which they were offered a post-chamber test meal.

Test meal
A test meal was provided to assess ad-libitum food intake. The foods were provided in large quantities and consisted of fruit salad, turkey sandwiches and chocolate chip cookies. Nutritional and food composition of these foods are shown in Table 2. Subjects were instructed to choose which food they wanted to eat first and were allowed to eat as much as they wanted of this food. Then, they selected the next food to eat while the first food was removed. After finishing with the second food, the same procedure was followed with the last food. Participants were not required to eat from all foods or to finish any food if they were not interested. However they were required to eat at least one food. Only water was provided with meals. Participants were unaware of the purpose of the test meal protocol. The amount of food eaten was calculated as the difference between food weights before and after ad-libitum consumption.

Euglycemic-hyperinsulinemic clamp
Insulin sensitivity was measured by a euglycemic-hyperinsulinemic clamp (16). Subjects were asked to refrain from vigorous physical activity for 48 h before the clamp. After an overnight fast, insulin (80 mU/m2 per min) was infused for 3 hours while a 20% glucose solution was infused simultaneously to maintain glycemia at 90 mg/dL. Plasma levels of glucose and insulin were measured in triplicate, at 5 minute intervals at baseline and during steady-state from 165 to 180 min post glucose infusion. The glucose disposal rate, a measure of insulin sensitivity, was adjusted for estimated metabolic body size (EMBS = FFM [kg] + 17.7) (17).

Body composition
Body fat mass and fat-free mass were measured on a Hologic Dual Energy X-ray Absorptiometer in the fan beam mode (QDR 4500; Hologic, Waltham, MA).

Respiration chamber
Twenty four-hour energy expenditure and respiratory quotient (RQ; VCO2 produced/VO2 consumed) were determined in a whole-room respiration calorimeter as previously described (18). Oxygen and carbon dioxide concentrations were measured using a Magnos 4G magneto-pneumatic oxygen analyzer and Uras 3G infrared CO2 analyzer (Hartmann and Braun). Energy expenditure and substrate oxidations were calculated from oxygen consumption, carbon dioxide production, and 24-h urinary nitrogen excretion using the equations of Acheson et al. (19). Fat, protein and carbohydrate balances were calculated as a difference between macronutrient intake and oxidation measured over the 4 days of controlled feeding (1-day 49%-carbohydrate diet plus 3-d 50%-fat diet). The coefficient of variation calculated from repeated measurements of 24-h energy expenditure is &lt;5%.

Statistical analysis
Data are presented as mean ± SD. Analyses were performed using SAS version 9.1.3 (SAS Institute, Cary, NC). Normal distribution was evaluated using Shapiro-Wilk test. Paired t-test was used to evaluate differences before and after the HFD. The balance between intake and expenditure for energy and macronutrients was evaluated with a t-test. Multiple regression stepwise analysis was used to explore the factors best predicting ad-libitum energy and nutrient intakes. The rejection level in statistical tests was 5%.

Results
Both weight-maintaining diets were well tolerated and completely eaten by the volunteers at all times. During the 4 days spent in the respiration chamber, subjects had a slightly positive energy balance of around 60 kcal per day (Table 3). However, a significant reduction in body weight was observed (−0.27 ± 0.58 kg; range: −1.7 – 0.8 kg; p&lt;0.0001), which was unrelated to energy balance (r=0.12, p=0.08).

Energy and macronutrient balance in the respiration chamber
The switch in the diet from a food quotient of 0.87 for the 49% carbohydrate diet to 0.83 for the 50% fat diet, promoted the expected reduction in the 24-h RQ after 3 days of HFD consumption from 0.87 ± 0.02 to 0.83 ± 0.02 (p&lt;0.0001). Using multivariate regression analysis, we assessed whether cumulative energy balance, percent body fat and insulin sensitivity were significant predictors of 24-h RQ on each day. Only cumulative energy balance was a significant and positive predictor of 24-h RQ after one (p=0.01) and two (p=0.02) days of high-fat feeding. After 3 days of HFD, energy, carbohydrate and fat balances were different from zero (p&lt;0.001; Table 3), while protein balance had a borderline significance (p=0.07; Table 3). Cumulative energy and fat balances over 4 days were directly associated (r=0.54, p&lt;0.0001); whereas, cumulative carbohydrate and protein balances were unrelated to energy balance. Cumulative carbohydrate and fat balances were inversely correlated independent of cumulative energy balance (r=−0.77; p&lt;0.0001). Substrate balances (day-to-day or cumulative) were unaffected by the degree of insulin sensitivity.

Determinant factors of ad-libitum intake
After 3 days of eating the HFD in the chamber, subjects were allowed to eat the test meal ad-libitum for 4 hours. During that period they ingested 40 ± 19% (880 ± 442 kcal) of their previously measured total energy requirement. Carbohydrate was the main nutrient ingested (47 ± 13%), followed by fat (44 ± 9%) and protein (11 ± 3%).

We primarily determined the influence of energy balance measured in a metabolic chamber (day-to-day and cumulative) on post-chamber ad-libitum energy intake. Fat-free mass was also included in the regression model. Energy balance did not predict ad-libitum energy intake (p&gt;0.15); whereas fat-free mass was a significant and positive determinant of ad-libitum energy intake (R2=0.11; p=0.01). In addition, the influence of macronutrient balances and fat-free mass on ad-libitum energy intake was determined. Beside fat-free mass, 4-d cumulative carbohydrate balance showed a significant and positive influence on ad-libitum energy intake (Figure 1 and Table 4). In line with this finding, cumulative carbohydrate balance was also a significant predictor of the amount of food and macronutrients eaten during the post-chamber ad-libitum test (Table 4). Finally, we found no association between insulin sensitivity measured prior to the respiration chamber stay and post-chamber ad-libitum intake.

Discussion
The results of this study showed that in response to an isoenergetic change in dietary fat and carbohydrate content, nutrient balance differed as a function of the individual’s metabolic adaptability to the high-fat feeding. Less adaptable individuals to the increase in dietary fat will have a higher carbohydrate oxidation relative to carbohydrate intake leading to lower carbohydrate balance. We hypothesized that this lower carbohydrate balance will be associated to increased post-chamber ad-libitum energy intake. In contrast to our hypothesis and previous studies in mice (2) and humans (7, 8), we found a direct association between carbohydrate balance and ad-libitum energy intake. The present results are also different when compared with several studies showing no effect of carbohydrate balance manipulations on subsequent energy intake (3–5). This lack of consistency among studies may result from the fact that carbohydrate oxidation is the main homeostatic mechanism responsible to preserve carbohydrate stores (3, 5, 7). As a consequence, variations in energy intake can be anticipated to be small and difficult to detect, particularly when energy intake is evaluated in a small sample size for a short period of time.

Because carbohydrate and fat balances were inversely related, one could interpret this finding as a suggestion of an eventual role of positive fat balance on decreasing energy intake. As a matter of fact, hypothalamic lipid concentration is a negative predictor of energy intake in mice (20, 21). However, we found null influence of whole-body fat balance on ad-libitum energy intake. Whether hypothalamic lipid balance plays a role on energy intake and how well related are whole-body and hypothalamic lipid balances have not been assessed in humans.

Interpretation of our results should take into account the design chosen. Volunteers were exposed to a 16-h fasting period which was longer than usual for these volunteers. We did not measure carbohydrate balance over the last 4 h prior to the meal test. However, a small influence on the actual carbohydrate balance when compared with the measured 4-d carbohydrate balance can be anticipated. We also assessed ad-libitum food intake for only 4 hours, which should be sufficient to evaluate short-term signals, but may miss the intermediate and long-term signals regulating food intake. In addition, participants did not have simultaneous access to the three food items available and were not allowed to go back to a previously chosen food once they were finished with this particular item. Because there is no “gold-standard” to assess ad-libitum food intake in humans, it is not possible to ascertain at what extent our protocol could influence the results. Finally, we did not include a control group receiving the 49%-carbohydrate diet for 4 days in order to compare our findings.

A common finding among studies is the large variance in ad-libitum energy intake that remains unexplained. This suggests that the assessment of energy intake regulation under laboratory conditions imposes a highly artificial environment to the participants. Alternatively, it is also possible that hedonic signals can interact and even override any biological regulation (22). In an effort to find out additional predictors of energy intake, insulin sensitivity measured before the metabolic chamber stay was included in the analysis. Insulin sensitivity has been shown to be a predictor of weight gain (23) and it could eventually influence energy intake. However, we found no influence of insulin sensitivity on ad-libitum energy intake. This result may be biased because insulin sensitivity might well be modified after 4 days of a HFD when compared with insulin sensitivity measured before the HFD (23, 24).

So far, no signals in the liver and/or muscle have been identified to explain the potential effect of glycogen content on food intake. Most of the known circulating signals involved in food intake regulation are coming from tissues with no glycogen stores, such as the adipose tissue, the gut or the pancreas. If glycogen content plays a role in the regulation of food intake, this must be accompanied by the release of neuronal and/or humoral signals from the liver and/or muscle. The presence of vagal afferences from the liver to the central nervous system has been suggested to play this role (25).

In conclusion, this study showed that carbohydrate balance measured over 4 days prior predicted increased ad-libitum energy intake, which is in contrast to Flatt’s findings in mice (2). Further investigations of this new finding are necessary to allow for a better understanding of the role of carbohydrate balance on energy intake regulation in humans.
