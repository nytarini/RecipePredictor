        The Food Safety Commission of Japan (FSCJ) conducted a risk assessment on
acrylamide (AA) (CAS No. 79-06-1) in foods generated through heating, as a
self-tasking risk assessment. In rodent toxicity studies, major adverse effects
were observed on neurotoxicity and male reproductive toxicity. Statistically
significant increases in incidences were observed in the carcinogenicity studies
in Harderian gland, mammary gland, lung and forestomach in mice, and in mammary
gland, thyroid and testis in rats. Positive results were also obtained from
in vitro and in vivo genotoxicity studies
of AA and glycidamide (GA). Therefore, FSCJ recognized AA as a genotoxic
carcinogen. Judging from the dietary AA intake among Japanese people, the
non-neoplastic risk is extremely low because of sufficient margins of exposure
(MOEs). The neoplastic risk, however, could not be excluded due to the
insufficient MOEs, although no clear evidence on human health effect have been
provided from the epidemiological studies. It is important to note that no
consistent relationships between AA exposure and cancer incidences have been
observed even in the studies focusing on the highly exposed populations in
occupational settings. FSCJ thus concluded that continual efforts are necessary
to reduce dietary AA intakes in accordance with the principle of ALARA (as low
as reasonably achievable) from the viewpoint of public health.
