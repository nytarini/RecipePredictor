   The critical and obvious role that the bowel plays in the life of an organism is to be the site where digestion and absorption of ingested food occurs. These functions, however, are not simply accomplished, but require enteric motility and management by the nervous system. In addition to its well-known roles in controlling gastrointestinal motility and secretion, the nervous system regulates mucosal epithelial growth,1,2 as well as gastrointestinal manifestations of immunity and inflammation.3,4 Although the gut has long been known to be able to function independently of input from the central nervous system [CNS],5 it cannot function independently of input from its intrinsic enteric nervous system [ENS]; a lethal pseudo-obstruction occurs when even a small segment of bowel is aganglionic. Such an aganglionosis may be acquired, as it is, for example, in Chagas disease,6 which occurs as a consequence of infection with the protist, Trypansoma cruzi, or as a result of enteric zoster,7 which occurs when varicella zoster virus reactivates from latency in enteric neurons. Aganglionoses may also be congenital. Congenital aganglionoses are, despite heterogeneity, referred to collectively as Hirschsprung disease [congenital megacolon], which is a multigenic disorder with variable penetrance that may involve short or long segments of bowel.8–10 Whether an aganglionic region is long or short, acquired or congenital, survival requires that the aganglionic bowel be removed surgically. The results of the surgical excision of an aganglionic region of gut, although life saving, are often disappointing in that dysmotility, enterocolitis, and soiling may persist despite the complete removal of aganglionic tissue.8 Better therapy, such as stem cell transplantation, awaits advances in knowledge of ENS development, which is advanced by resources included in the article “Transcription and Signaling Regulators in Developing Neuronal Subtypes of Mouse and Human Enteric Nervous System” in the current issue of Gastroenterology (Figure 1).

Hirschsprung disease has attracted a great deal of investigative attention because aganglionosis is an obvious lesion. With the exception of surgeons who recognize that it is dangerous to leave behind portions of the hypoplastic transition zone when surgery is done to excise aganglionic intestine,8 physicians have tended to think of the ENS in binary terms, as there or not there. There has been relatively little investigation of the effects of ENS hypoplasia or hyperplasia in the human intestine, although both are functionally deleterious when either is genetically induced in mice.2,4,11–15 Hyperplasia and hypoplasia of the human ENS, moreover, are known to occur and both are associated with dysmotility. Examples of ENS hyperplasia are intestinal ganglioneuromatosis, which occurs in association with neurofibromatosis type 1 and multiple endocrine neoplasia 2B,16–18 and intestinal neuronal dysplasia type B, which involves hyperplastic ganglia in the submucosa.18,19 Diffuse ENS hypoplasia also oc Given that ENS development is very complicated and that its formation involves the coordinated action of many genes,10 it seems reasonable to expect that defects will arise during development that are not sufficient to cause an aganglionosis but that, nevertheless, are sufficient to cause functional abnormalities of the ENS. These defects could involve the number of enteric neurons, the relative proportions of the various neuronal phenotypes, or their interconnections. The state of neuropathologic examination of the human intestine is such that abnormalities of this sort would probably go undetected. As a result, one can only speculate about how much underlying developmental abnormalities of the ENS contribute to functional gastrointestinal disorders of unknown etiology or even, given the linkage of the ENS to inflammation,3 to disorders associated with a clear anatomic pathology, such as inflammatory bowel disease.

Understanding the genetic control of the cellular gymnastics that give rise to the ENS during ontogeny is a necessary prerequisite to devising means of alleviating and, better, preventing disorders of the ENS that arise when control of its development is defective. In fact, knowledge of ENS neuropathology is so rudimentary that a clear understanding of ENS genetics and development might even help to categorize those disorders. One might think that the ENS is a simple nervous system that, when understood, would further comprehension of the much more complex CNS. A simple nervous system, however, is an oxymoron; moreover, the CNS has patterned germinal zones in which precursor cells give rise to functionally related neurons, which has greatly facilitated investigation of neuronal development in the CNS. No similar patterned germinal zones have been recognized in the bowel. Although a variety of transcription and growth factors have been identified that critically affect enteric neuronal and glia development,10,20 transcriptional signatures of the kind that allow the differential lineage of maturity of CNS neurons to be inferred do not exist for the ENS. What is badly needed is a reference manual that describes the expression profiles of the regulators of transcription and signaling in sublineages of developing enteric neurons at different stages of ontogeny. Fortunately, Memic et al21 [“Transcription and Signaling Regulators in Developing Neuronal Subtypes of Mouse and Human Enteric Nervous System”] have provided an encyclopedic compendium of information in the current issue of Gastroenterology that does just this.

Memic et al21 generated and compared RNA expression profiles of the entire ENS, ENS progenitor cells, and non-ENS gut cells of mice, collected early and late during the formation of different types of neurons (Figure 1). To do so, they used flow cytometry to isolate the various types of cells. In situ hybridization and immunocytochemistry were then employed to devise regional maps of differentially expressed proteins in both the murine and human gut as a function of developmental age. The authors identified 147 transcription and signaling factors that varied in their spatial and temporal expression during murine ENS ontogeny, as well as 16 signaling pathways. Most of the analyzed factors w ere conserved in the human ENS. As an additional advance, beyond the prodigious and beautifully illustrated volume of data, the authors show that the gene encoding Sox6 is necessary for the development of gastric dopaminergic neurons and that these neurons are important for gastric emptying. The nature and sheer elegance of the authors’ data provides an important resource for basic and translational scientists that will ensure the use of this article as a foundational resource for a long time to come.

Figure 1. Colonization of the bowel by precursors derived from the neural crest. All of the precursor cells that give rise to the ENS migrate to the gut from the neural crest. Although only the vagal crest is illustrated, the postumbilical bowel is also colonized by émigrés from the sacral crest and by Schwann cells that enter the lower gut with extrinsic nerves. All of these enteric crest-derived cells (ENCDC) ultimately develop as neurons and glia within the bowel. Although the original population in the premigratory crest is heterogeneous, the ENCDC population, as a whole, is plastic and responsive to microenvironmental signals the ENCDCs enounter while migrating to the gut, within the bowel, and in their final sites of residence in ENS ganglia. Microenvironmental signals include growth factors and extracellular matrix components that drive ENCDC proliferation, differentiation, and finally, assembly of the microcircuits of the ENS. ENCDC are also influenced by their intrinsic transcription factors that regulate neurogenesis from stem cells, as well as neuronal specification and/or differentiation.
