on (EU), apples (Malus &#xD7; domestica Borkh.) are the most important fruits in terms of harvested product (average annual production of approximately 12 million of Mg in the triennium 2015&#x2013;2017).1 With a total amount of approximately 2.3 million of Mg year&#x2212;1 (2015&#x2013;2017), Italy ranks seventh as an apple producer at the global scale, but ranks third with respect to export, which, in 2017 accounted for more than US $950 million.2, 3 Golden Delicious is the main variety both on a continental and national scale, although its acreage has decreased in the recent years. In Italy, its cultivation is widespread in the Northern regions, especially in the alpine districts of South Tyrol and Val di Non (Trentino&#x2010;South Tyrol region) and Valtellina (Lombardia region).
      About two&#x2010;thirds of Italian apples come from Trentino&#x2010;South Tyrol. As a result of microclimate and geological conditions, the region represents an excellent cultivation area for apples. In the triennium 2015&#x2013;2017, apple production reached impressive goals, with an average of approximately 1&#x2009;000&#x2009;000 and 420&#x2009;000&#x2009;Mg&#x2009;year&#x2212;1 of harvested apples in South Tyrol and Trentino, respectively. During the 20th Century, apple cultivation expanded largely also in Valtellina (Lombardia) and, in the last few decades, it reached 35&#x2009;000&#x2009;Mg&#x2009;year&#x2212;1.
      Between 2003 and 2010, several apple varieties, including Golden Delicious, cultivated in these three areas of Northern Italy were granted with the EU Geographical Indications (GIs). In 2003, apples from Val di Non received the PDO label (&#x2018;Mela Val di Non&#x2019;, EC Regulation 1665/2003), whereas those from South Tyrol and Valtellina obtained the PGI label, respectively, in 2005 (&#x2018;Mela Alto Adige&#x2010;S&#xFC;dtiroler Apfel&#x2019;, EC Regulation 1855/2005) and 2010 (&#x2018;Mela di Valtellina&#x2019;, EC Regulation 171/2010). These labels certify the link between unique features of the product and the place of origin. Moreover, they ensure the consumers the compliance with specific production guidelines, which also define a well&#x2010;established registration system along the whole production chain.
      Analytical methods are important tools for protecting the authenticity and the reputation of high&#x2010;quality horticultural products labeled with GIs, as in the case of apples. Among the available methods, the analysis of the 87Sr/86Sr ratio has been largely applied to link a product with its geographical origin because it provides an almost unique fingerprint linked to the soil where trees grow.4, 5 The 87Sr/86Sr ratio of a crop is directly related to that of the Sr&#x2010;bioavailable fraction in the soil, which mainly depends and varies according to the geolithological features of the growing area.6, 7, 8 Its high potential as soil&#x2010;derived traceability marker to distinguish different types of horticultural products according to their origin, either alone or coupled with other analytical methods has been demonstrated in several studies.9, 10, 11, 12, 13

      The present study aimed at applying 87Sr/86Sr analysis to characterize the Italian PDO and PGI Golden Delicious apples in comparison with fruits of the same variety from other areas of Northern Italy where no GIs for apples are registered (non&#x2010;GI apples from Emilia Romagna, Lombardia, Piemonte and Veneto). The annual variability of the 87Sr/86Sr ratio in apple samples was verified comparing the 87Sr/86Sr ratio of apples collected from the same orchards in two consecutive years (2017 and 2018). Moreover, the apple 87Sr/86Sr ratio was evaluated in relation to the 87Sr/86Sr ratio of the bioavailable Sr fraction extracted from the soil sampled in each orchard and the data were interpreted according to the local geolithological information.

      MATERIALS AND METHODS

        Reagents
        Nitric acid (Merck, Darmstadt, Germany) and high purity deionized water (18.2 M&#x3A9;&#x2009;cm) (Elix; Millipore, Billerica, MA, USA), additionally purified through a sub&#x2010;boiling duoPur distillation system (Milestone, Sorisole, Italy), were used throughout the entire experiment and analytical work. Ammonium nitrate and Suprapur&#xAE; hydrogen peroxide were purchased from Sigma&#x2010;Aldrich (St Louis, MO, USA). Mono&#x2010;elemental certified standards of rubidium (Rb) and strontium (Sr) were purchased from ULTRA Scientific (North Kingstown, RI, USA); calcium (Ca) from Agilent Technologies (Agilent Technologies Inc., Santa Clara, CA, USA); and germanium (Ge), scandium (Sc) and yttrium (Y) from Merck. Quality controls (QCs) were prepared diluting the TMDA&#x2010;64.3 certified reference material (LabService Analytica Srl, Anzola dell'Emilia, Italy) for the inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometer (ICP&#x2010;MS) and the SRM 987 (NIST, Gaithersburg, MD, USA) with a certified Sr isotope composition for the multicollector ICP&#x2010;MS (MC ICP&#x2010;MS). Strontium separation was accomplished using a strontium&#x2013;selective resin (SR&#x2010;B100&#x2010;S, particle size 50&#x2013;100&#x2009;&#x3BC;m) purchased from TrisKem International (Bruz, France). Cellulose acetate filters (0.45&#x2009;&#x3BC;m) and polypropylene disposable tubes were purchased from Vetrotecnica (Padova, Italy). Hydrophilic polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE) filters (0.45&#x2009;&#x3BC;m) were obtained from Thermo Fisher Scientific (Waltham, MA, USA). All the disposable vessels and tubes were soaked for 24&#x2009;h with a nitric acid solution (0.7 mol L&#x2013;1) and then rinsed with high&#x2010;purity water before use. Reagents and chemicals were stored in accordance with the respective manufacturer&#x2019;s instructions.

        Sampling sites
        Two sampling campaigns were performed to collect apple and soil samples between August and September in both 2017 and 2018 (Fig. 1 and Table 1). All selected orchards were cultivated with the same apple variety (cv. Golden Delicious, rootstock M9) and the trees were in full production. Fruit sampling was performed in the 2&#x2010;week period before harvest (August to September). The apple orchards included in the study were located in five regions of Northern Italy: Emilia Romagna, Lombardia, Piemonte, Trentino&#x2010;South Tyrol and Veneto. The number of orchards per region varied according to the extension of the cultivation area. PDO apples were collected in Val di Non and Val di Sole (Trentino); PGI apples from South Tyrol were collected in Val Venosta (including two orchards in the surrounding of Merano, no. 22 and 24) (Table 1), in the surrounding of Bressanone and southern of Bolzano (later referred to as &#x2018;Val d'Adige&#x2019;), whereas PGI apples from Lombardia were collected in Valtellina. Non&#x2010;GI apples came from 13 orchards located in Emilia Romagna, Lombardia, Piemonte and Veneto. More details, including geographical coordinates and altitude of each orchard, are provided in Table 1.

        Sampling campaign
        In 2017, apples were collected from 41 orchards and, within each orchard, three fruits per tree were harvested from ten randomly selected trees. Fruits were sampled at a height of 1&#x2013;2 m from the ground. The three apples were grouped together to create a bulk sample for each tree (n = 410). In 2018, the sampling campaign was repeated in 20 of the previously investigated orchards, and both apple and soil samples were collected. The orchards for the 2018 sampling were selected to cover the whole sampling area and the whole range of the 87Sr/86Sr ratio of the apples collected in 2017 (Table 1). The apple sampling was repeated following the same procedure adopted in 2017 using five trees per each orchard (n = 100). Beneath the canopy of each sampled tree, a soil core (at a depth of 10&#x2013;40&#x2009;cm from the surface) was collected at a distance of 30&#x2009;cm from the tree trunk using a soil auger (one&#x2010;piece Edelman type). Each soil core was treated as a bulk sample (n = 100).

        Sample preparation

Sr extraction from soil samples

        Soil samples were dried at 65&#x2009;&#xB0;C for 48&#x2009;h and sieved at 2&#x2009;mm. All the root pieces were manually removed. The Sr&#x2010;bioavailable fraction was extracted with NH4NO3 in accordance with the official method DIN ISO 19730.14
Acid digestion of apples

        On each of the three apples collected per tree, the peel was manually removed using a peeler. Then, the three central disks (approximate thickness of 1&#x2009;cm) were isolated from lateral disks and the fruit core was removed. The disks were freeze&#x2010;dried and powdered together to create a bulk sample per tree. Each sample (0.5 g) was digested in a Milestone UltraWAVE apparatus, adding 5 mL of sub&#x2010;boiled HNO3 (14&#x2009;mol&#x2009;L&#x2010;1) and 1 mL of H2O2. After digestion, samples were filtered with PTFE filters (0.45&#x2009;&#x3BC;m).

        Sr/matrix separation
        Sr/matrix separation was performed with a Sr&#x2010;specific resin (TrisKem International), in accordance with the methods proposed by Swoboda et al.9 and Durante et al.,16 with slight modification as described in a previous study.17 The efficiency of the Sr/matrix separation was verified at the ICP&#x2010;MS, and then the final concentration of the Sr solutions was adjusted to 200&#x2009;ng&#x2009;g&#x2212;1 for soil&#x2010;derived samples and 20&#x2009;ng&#x2009;g&#x2212;1 for apple&#x2010;derived samples.

        ICP&#x2010;MS and MC ICP&#x2010;MS analysis
        Calcium, Rb and Sr were quantitatively analyzed using an inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometer (iCAP Q ICP&#x2010;MS) (Thermo Scientific, Bremen, Germany) equipped with an autosampler ASX&#x2010;520 (Cetac Technologies Inc., Omaha, NE, USA). The calibration curve was prepared in the range 0.025&#x2013;250&#x2009;ng&#x2009;g&#x2212;1 for Rb and Sr, and in the range 0.025&#x2013;25&#x2009;&#x3BC;g&#x2009;g&#x2212;1 for Ca, including instrumental blanks. In the investigated range, the calibration curves showed good linearity (r
2&#x2009;&gt;&#x2009;0.9996). A standard solution of Sc, Ge and Y was used as internal standard. The accuracy of the instrument was monitored measuring the certified reference material TMDA&#x2010;64.3 as a QC at different dilutions. On average, element concentrations in the QC solutions ranged between 90% and 110% of the certified value. The operating conditions were reported in a previous study.15

        The 87Sr/86Sr was measured with a double&#x2010;focusing MC ICP&#x2010;MS (Neptune Plus&#x2122;; Thermo Scientific). Soil samples were measured in wet&#x2010;plasma conditions, whereas apple samples in dry&#x2010;plasma conditions [CETAC Aridus apparatus as aerosol drying unit (Teledyne, Omaha, NE, USA) and a Jet sample cone&#x2009;+&#x2009;Ni &#x2018;H' skimmer cone (Thermo Scientific)]. Instrument configuration, typical operating conditions and data corrections as were reported in previous studies.15, 17

        The instrument was tuned daily and its accuracy was determined analyzing the SRM 987, with a certified 87Sr/86Sr ratio at the beginning, at the end and at every block of samples in the sequence bracketed with a blank solution.18, 19 Replicated measurements of the SRM 987 (n = 114), both in wet and dry plasma configuration, provided an average 87Sr/86Sr ratio of 0.710257&#x2009;&#xB1;&#x2009;0.000014 (with the uncertainty expressed as twice the standard deviation, 2sd) within the measuring period of this study, in agreement with the instrumental precision reported by other authors.11, 20 This result is also consistent with both the certified and &#x2018;generally accepted&#x2019; value, respectively equals to 0.71034&#x2009;&#xB1;&#x2009;0.00026 and 0.710263&#x2009;&#xB1;&#x2009;0.000016 (with the uncertainty expressed as 2 s), and provides an estimate of the instrument long&#x2010;term precision and accuracy. Considering the repeatability of the analytical procedure, several independent aliquots of apples (n = 15) and soil samples (n = 19) were prepared and analyzed, in accordance with the procedure described above. The relative standard deviations obtained were, respectively, 0.0018% and 0.0025% for apple and soil samples.

        Statistical analysis
        Statistical analysis was applied to evaluate the results of the 87Sr/86Sr analysis at different levels. Kruskal&#x2013;Wallis one&#x2010;way analysis of variance and a Dunn post&#x2010;hoc test (with Bonferroni correction) were applied to compare mean values from 87Sr/86Sr analysis of each cultivation district. The non&#x2010;parametric analysis of variance was applied because the groups included in the comparison did not have an equal number of samples and at least one of the conditions enabling parametrical tests (normal distribution, variance homogeneity) was not satisfied. For this comparison, the three main cultivation districts of South Tyrol (Val Venosta, Bressanone area and Val d'Adige) were treated as separated groups, together with the other districts. Linear correlation analysis and a two&#x2010;tailed t test for paired samples was applied to evaluate the year&#x2010;to&#x2010;year (2017 versus 2018) variability of the 87Sr/86Sr ratio in apple samples. Linear correlation was also applied to the results of the 87Sr/86Sr ratio analysis of the apple and soil samples. Cluster analysis, according to Euclidean distances and Ward's hierarchical method, was used as an unsupervised technique to divide the dataset into different groups with the lowest internal variance and the highest difference between groups based solely on the 87Sr/86Sr ratios. P&#x2009;&lt;&#x2009;0.05 was considered statistically significant. The statistical analysis was performed using the computing environment R (R Core Team, 2016).

      RESULTS AND DISCUSSION

        Year&#x2010;to&#x2010;year 87Sr/86Sr ratio variability and correlation with the soil 87Sr/86Sr ratio
        The 87Sr/86Sr ratio of apples collected in 2017 ranged from a minimum of 0.7074&#x2009;&#xB1;&#x2009;0.0002 (mean&#x2009;&#xB1;&#x2009;SD) to a maximum of 0.7207&#x2009;&#xB1;&#x2009;0.0016 (Fig. 2). PGI apples from Val Venosta had, on average, the highest 87Sr/86Sr ratio (0.7158&#x2009;&#xB1;&#x2009;0.0032), although the six orchards stretched along a large range of values (Fig. 2). The ratio of apples from Val Venosta was not statistically different from the PGI apples originating from Valtellina (0.7119&#x2009;&#xB1;&#x2009;0.0023) or the Bressanone area (0.7099&#x2009;&#xB1;&#x2009;0.0013). At the same time, apples from Val Venosta differed from PGI apples from Val d'Adige (0.7096&#x2009;&#xB1;&#x2009;0.0008) and from the non&#x2010;GI apples cultivated in other apple districts in Northern Italy. The latter, despite the large extension of the sampling area that included orchards from five different regions (Fig. 1), showed a quite narrow variability of the 87Sr/86Sr ratio (0.7089&#x2009;&#xB1;&#x2009;0.0003). Non&#x2010;GI apples had isotope ratios significantly lower than the ratio of Valtellina too. PDO apples from most orchards in Val di Non fell in a narrow range of values, between 0.7074 and 0.7095, although two orchards (no. 5 and 8), located at the border with Val Venosta, on a different rock type (Fig. 1), had higher values (0.7136&#x2009;&#xB1;&#x2009;0.0009) (Fig. 2). When these two orchards were excluded from the statistical analysis, it was found that apples from Val di Non had significantly lower 87Sr/86Sr ratio than those from Val Venosta and Valtellina. For a complete overview of the results, the whole dataset is reported in the Supporting information (Table S1).

          Figure 2

87Sr/86Sr ratios measured in apple orchards (2017) grouped according to the cultivation district. Horizontal lines represent the mean&#x2009;&#xB1;&#x2009;SD of each district. Each symbol represents one orchard and is the mean of 10 apple samples. Open squares represent the two orchards in Val di Non excluded from the mean calculation and the analysis of variance among cultivation districts. Different letters indicate a significant difference among districts (P&#x2009;&lt;&#x2009;0.05).

        Figure 3 shows the correlation between the 87Sr/86Sr ratio of soil extracts and that of the corresponding apples collected during the second sampling campaign (see Supporting information, Table S2). The isotopic composition of apple and soil extracts collected in 2018 was in the range 0.7074&#x2013;0.7207 and 0.7065&#x2013;0.7191, respectively. As shown in Fig. 3(B), a strong positive correlation between 87Sr/86Sr ratios of apple and soil samples was found (r = 0.99, P&#x2009;&lt;&#x2009;0.01). Such agreement has been already reported previously,11, 21, 22 and confirms the dependence of the apple 87Sr/86Sr ratios on that of the soil. Moreover, a good overlap was found between the range of variability of the ratios for the apple and soil samples within each orchard, as attested by the SDs reported in Supporting information (Table S2).

          Figure 3

        In Fig. 4, a comparison of the 87Sr/86Sr ratio of apples collected in the two consecutive years is provided. Considering only the 20 orchards sampled both in 2017 and 2018, the 87Sr/86Sr ratio was in the range 0.7074&#x2013;0.7207 in 2017 and 0.7071&#x2013;0.7212 in 2018. The correlation between data was very high (r&#x2009;&gt;&#x2009;0.996, P&#x2009;&lt;&#x2009;0.01) and, in all but five orchards, the data corresponded perfectly (Fig. 4). This confirms that the 87Sr/86Sr ratio is a rather stable indicator characterized by temporal invariance.23 Comparing the mean ratios for apples collected in 2017 and 2018, significant differences between the 2&#x2009;years were found for five orchards (no. 2, 9, 38, 40 and 41) (Fig. 4). For two of them (no. 40 and 41), the difference between the two ratios was significant despite a low difference between the two mean ratios that was 0.00005 and 0.00008, respectively. Moreover, the 87Sr/86Sr ratio of apples within the two orchards was highly homogeneous, with SDs lower than 0.000025, on average, for both years. This confirms that, for orchards characterized by high intra&#x2010;orchard homogeneity, such as orchards no. 40 and 41, even extremely low differences between mean ratios can be significant.17

            Comparison between the mean 87Sr/86Sr ratios of apples from two consecutive years (2017 and 2018) for each orchard. Orchards are numbered according to Table 1. Asterisks denote statistical significance: *P&#x2009;&lt;&#x2009;0.05, **P&#x2009;&lt;&#x2009;0.01, ***P&#x2009;&lt;&#x2009;0.001.

        Interpretation of the apple 87Sr/86Sr ratio based on geolithological information
        The cluster analysis was applied to group the orchards based solely on similarities of their 87Sr/86Sr ratio. In Fig. 5, the outcome of the hierarchical procedure is provided (agglomerative coefficient = 0.98). At a distance of 4, three different groups could be identified, suggesting that apples are not separated according to geographical or commercial borders. The first group (i.e. the largest) includes 29 orchards producing PGI apples from South Tyrol (n = 6 from Val d'Adige and n = 3 from Bressanone), PGI apples from Valtellina (n = 1), PDO apples from Val di Non (n = 6) and all the orchards producing non&#x2010;GI apples (n = 13). The second group consists of one orchard each from Bressanone, Val d'Adige, Val di Non, Valtellina and two orchards from Val Venosta. The third group includes one orchard from Val di Non and Valtellina and four orchards from Val Venosta.

          Figure 5

            Dendrogram of cluster analysis based on the 87Sr/86Sr ratios of apple samples.

        To better explain these results, the relationship between the apples and their area of cultivation was examined. Because there was a good correlation between soil and apple 87Sr/86Sr ratio in the investigated sampling sites (Fig. 3), the results of the cluster analysis were compared with geolithological information available for each area (Fig. 1). The bioavailable Sr fraction in the soil derives largely from that of the minerals present in the bedrock, from which Sr is released via a mechanism of differential weathering.24, 25 Therefore, the soil 87Sr/86Sr represents a weighted average of the local mineral composition. The 87Sr/86Sr ratio presently measured in Sr&#x2010;bearing minerals results from the sum of the primordial and radiogenic 87Sr and depends on three pivotal factors: the initial 87Sr/86Sr, the Rb/Sr ratio and the age of the mineral. In general, minerals showing the lowest ratios are carbonates and plagioclase feldspars, whereas the highest ratios are measured in K&#x2010;feldspars and micas.8

        As already noted, all the orchards producing non&#x2010;GI apples (no. 29&#x2013;41) belong to the first cluster. These orchards are located mostly in a vast basin, the Pianura Padana, characterized by sedimentary deposits that developed alluvial soils. This basin is bounded by mountain chains (Alps to the North and Apennine to the South) and it expands to the Adriatic Sea. The Po river, its tributaries and a series of Apennine rivers create the local fluvial network. Lithological analysis revealed that the sediments mostly characterizing the alluvial plain are limestones, felsic intrusive rocks, dolomites, mafic and ultramafic detritus, sandstones and marls, and littoral and shallow&#x2010;marine deposits, with a cyclic sedimentation pattern being described along the plain.26, 27, 28 The 87Sr/86Sr ratios of apples measured in the present study (0.7089&#x2009;&#xB1;&#x2009;0.0003) fall within a range of values comparable to the range measured in the Modena district and adjacent provinces in other studies, which reported ratios of around 0.708&#x2013;0.710,16, 21, 23 and are compatible with the lithological description of the Pianura Padana.
        The first cluster also includes six orchards from Val di Non (no. 1&#x2013;4, 6 and 7). The apple cultivated in Val di Non were mainly characterized by low isotope ratios (Fig. 2; see also Supporting information, Table S1). Low values of 87Sr/86Sr ratio can be ascribed to the position of the orchards cultivated on soil that developed over colluvial fans of carbonate sediments from the Triassic period. Indeed, this area is characterized by the presence of carbonate rocks (calcite and dolomite) that formed in a marine environment through the precipitation of calcium carbonate (shell debris, fecal material, coral fragments). In a study conducted by Faure et al.29 in Val Camonica (Lombardia) on carbonate rocks, 87Sr/86Sr ranged between 0.7070&#x2013;0.7085, and it was stated that these values are representative of the Sr present in the ocean at the deposition time. Willmes et al.30 measured similar 87Sr/86Sr ratios for dolomites and limestones in France (0.707&#x2013;0.710).
        In the lower part of the Val d'Adige, orchards are cultivated on soils formed from quaternary deposits. The whole valley was modeled by the effect of multiple glaciations that occurred in the Pleistocene and the fine&#x2010;grained sediments (sand, silt, clay) filling the valley are mainly of alluvial and glacio&#x2010;alluvial origin, locally mixed with detritus originating the lateral slopes.31, 32, 33 The surrounding area is characterized by the presence of the &#x2018;Complesso Vulcanico Atesino&#x2019;, formed during the early Permian and covering an area of 2000&#x2009;km2. The &#x2018;Formazione di Ora&#x2019; is the most recent volcanic deposit of the area and covers an area of approximately 1500&#x2009;km2 that includes both sides of the Val d'Adige South from Bolzano and is mainly composed of rhyolitic lapilli&#x2010;tuff.34 As a result, the 87Sr/86Sr in Val d'Adige tends to show values close to those typical for alluvial plains, although they showed higher variability with respect to the ratios in apple and soil samples (Figs 2 and 3; see also Supporting information, Table S1), in agreement with the geolithological information.
        All of the orchards located in the Bressanone area (no. 9, 10 and 12) are grouped in the first cluster, except one that belongs to the second cluster because it is characterized by a slightly higher 87Sr/86Sr. The cultivation area around Bressanone lays on a crystalline basement called Brixen Quarzphyllite (Variscan orogeny and low&#x2010;grade metamorphism), with a quite homogeneous lithology and the prevalence of minerals with a relatively low Rb/Sr ratio,34 which explains why the 87Sr/86Sr ratio of apples was rather low (0.7099&#x2009;&#xB1;&#x2009;0.0013 in apples, 0.7094&#x2009;&#xB1;&#x2009;0.0019 in soil extracts).
        Finally, the high 87Sr/86Sr ratios measured in apples produced in the orchards of the second and third cluster and located in Valtellina (0.7119&#x2009;&#xB1;&#x2009;0.0023), Val Venosta (0.7158&#x2009;&#xB1;&#x2009;0.0032), and two orchards of Val di Non (at the border with Val Venosta) (0.7136&#x2009;&#xB1;&#x2009;0.0009) can be related to the vast geological domain of the Austroalpine unit, a crystalline basement further divided into different subunits that shows a complex polymetamorphic history.35 Here, metamorphic rocks are mainly present, including feldspars, migmatites, pegmatites and orthogneisses (granite gneisses). Bioavailable Sr deriving from these minerals shows relatively high isotope ratios. Willmes et al.30 reported values between 0.710&#x2013;0.723 and 0.715&#x2013;0.721 for lithological areas rich in migmatite and orthogneiss rocks, respectively. The soil that developed on coarse&#x2010;grained sediments within this area is characterized by a relatively high heterogeneity and, hence, by a large range of 87Sr/86Sr ratio. Local differences and fluctuations in the 87Sr/86Sr ratio can be also ascribed to anthropogenic activity, as documented for certain areas of Val Venosta (e.g. the area of orchard no. 21), where fine landfill material was moved during the 1950s. The ratios of the two orchards located in the surrounding of Merano (no. 22 and 24) were also high (0.7155&#x2009;&#xB1;&#x2009;0.0008 in apples) (Table S1). In this case, the determining factor explaining the 87Sr/86Sr ratio in the apple orchards can be related to the presence of magmatic rocks (basaltic andesites, andesites, dacites, rhyodacites and rhyolites in different proportions) covering the metamorphic basement. In this area, the 87Sr/86Sr of these rocks can vary from 0.707 as measured in quarts norite to 0.744 as measured in granites, demonstrating the hybrid nature of these magmatic rocks.36, 37

        Further investigations, including grain size and petrographic analysis, would be help for highlighting local correlations between the Sr&#x2010;bioavailable fraction and the mineral composition. The available geolithological features combined with data from the literature already provided a good explanation of the measured ratios and clarify the formation of clusters that do not reflect commercial or geographical divisions.

      CONCLUSIONS
      The suitability of the 87Sr/86Sr ratio as soil&#x2010;derived traceability marker was tested to distinguish the production of Italian PDO and PGI apples (cv. Golden Delicious) from apples cultivated in other districts of Northern Italy. The 87Sr/86Sr ratios of apples collected from the main apple production districts and the 87Sr/86Sr ratios of the soil bioavailable Sr fraction were highly correlated. The results of the 87Sr/86Sr ratio analysis for a year&#x2010;to&#x2010;year comparison indiacted that this parameter is rather stable, showing a low temporal variability. The 87Sr/86Sr ratio of apples also agree with the geolithological features of the different cultivation areas. We can therefore confirm that the 87Sr/86Sr ratio is an excellent marker for studies of food traceability. However, whenever the cultivation districts had a similar soil Sr isotope composition, a complete separation of the apple districts based solely on the 87Sr/86Sr ratio of the apples was not possible. The apples produced in the Po valley had a rather homogeneous 87Sr/86Sr ratio, despite the relatively large size of the Po valley, because of the soil 87Sr/86Sr ratio homogeneity and also differed from those from Val Venosta and Valtellina. By contrast, PDO and PGI apples produced in relatively small mountain valleys show a higher variability of the 87Sr/86Sr ratio because the orchards are sometimes planted on soils from different bedrocks. In conclusion, the 87Sr/86Sr ratio has the potential to distinguish between different cultivation areas as long as these areas are characterized by geolithological differences. The present study represents first effort to enhance the tutelage of high&#x2010;quality apples cultivated in the Italian districts using objective and reliable analytical tools based on firm soil features. In the perspective of apple traceability, it would be useful to include other parameters related to geographic origin in the discrimination analysis; for example, multi&#x2010;element analysis or the light element isotope ratios.
