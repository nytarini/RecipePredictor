duction and consumption of ice cream
continue to increase every year (Smith,
2015). Ice cream, a milk based product, is a frozen dairy dessert obtained by
freezing the ice cream mix with continuous agitation and has become a dominant
consumer product for majority of the population. Consumers might assume that most of
the harmful microorganisms can be removed during the ice cream production process,
and that it is relatively safer than other foods owing to its low temperature during
storage and circulation process. As ice cream undergoes a sterilization process
during manufacturing and is stored at &#x2013;18&#x2103;, the manufacturer does not
mark the expiration date on ice cream products in Korea; however, the manufacturer
has to mark the production date as per Korean law. In addition, mentioning the
expiration date for ice cream is not mandatory as per the guidelines of Codex in
USA, EU, and in other countries. However, ice cream can be a good source for
microbial growth because of its nutrient content (milk protein, fat, and lactose),
neutral pH, and long storage, even though it is stored in a frozen state. During the
processing after the pasteurization step, there is a potential hazard of microbial
growth due to addition of contaminated ingredients or improper handling of the final
products including improper storage temperature. In particular, children, elderly
people, and immune-suppressed patients are likely to acquire foodborne illness due
to ice cream (Kanbakan et al., 2004). For
example, in recent years, Listeria monocytogenes has been involved
in numerous foodborne outbreaks that were linked to a variety of contaminated ice
creams in USA (CDC, 2015) (Cartwright et al., 2013). Therefore, to
establish an expiration date, characteristics indicators that can estimate the
shelf-life of ice cream products are needed (Lee and
Bae, 2011). In Korea, the shelf-life of a food is referred to as the
&#x201C;sell-by date.&#x201D; When the regulations regarding labeling of information
about the shelf-life are compared with those of other countries, it is compulsory
for food products in Korea to display the shelf-life. However, shelf life is
autonomously setup by manufacturing companies. Shelf-life is defined as the amount
of time it takes for the characteristics of food to deteriorate to the point where
it becomes undesirable for sale. It may also be defined as the storage time during
which a food product remains safe and retains its physical, chemical, and sensory
characteristics. Shelf-life dating has some benefits including several economic,
environmental, and moral consequences, as it determines the maximum
commercialization time for a product. For example, shelf-life dating decreases food
waste at both retail and household (European
Commission, 2010). Shelf-life is established typically using an
accelerated shelf-life test. An accelerated shelf-life test targets food that has
long-term expiration dates; it is a short-term test conducted under harsh conditions
to increase the rate of chemical or physical degradation of the product. A predicted
shelf-life for the specific storage environment of the product can be obtained by
extrapolation. Extrapolation from exaggerated testing conditions to ambient
conditions is usually done using the established relationships between kinetic
parameters and the storage environment (MFDS,
2015). Generally, ice creams do not have a shelf-life. Therefore, ice
cream is assessed using accelerated testing. Although there are many studies on the
determination of shelf-life of milk products with short shelf-lives (Choi, 2004; Lim,
2003; Yoon et al., 2013), studies
of ice cream products with a longer shelf-life are lacking. The aim of this study
was to estimate the shelf-life of ice cream using proven approaches in which the ice
cream was maintained at &#x2013;18&#x2103;, &#x2013;4&#x2103;, &#x2013;1&#x2103;,
and 4&#x2103; for 109 days.

      Materials and Methods

        Samples and experimental design
        Ice creams were selected and purchased from a local market at Seoul in Korea. Ice
cream (I1 and I2) manufactured by two different companies were selected. Ice
cream (I1) containing has 10% of milk fat and not less than 16% of milk solids,
and ice cream (I2) has containing 14% of milk fat and not less than 16% of milk
solids. Ice cream defined that samples is containing not less than 6% of milk
fat and not less than 16% of milk solids (Ministry of Food and Drug Safety, MFDS, 2017). Therefore, two
samples type of products is ice cream.

        Microbiological analysis
        For all microbiological experiments, the samples were serially diluted in sterile
distilled water, and all experiments were performed in triplicate. The data was
reported as the mean of three independent experiments. Microbiological analyses
were performed according to guidelines of the Ministry of Food and Drug Safety
(MFDS, 2015). Aerobic plate counts
were measured using plate count agar (Difico, Detroit, USA) and incubated at
35&#x2103; for 48 h. For coliform counts, the samples were plated on the surface
of deoxycholate agar (Difico) and incubated at 37&#x2103; for 48 h.
Listeria monocytogenes growth was assessed by surface
plating on PALCAM (Polymyxin Acriflavin LiCl Ceftazidime Esculin Mannitol) agar
(Difico) followed by incubation at 35&#x2103; for 48 h. Staphylococcus
aureus growth was determined by surface plating on Mannitol
Salt-Egg Yolk agar (Difico) followed by incubation at 35&#x2103; for 48 h. All
analyses were performed in triplicate. All microbiological analyses were
performed according to the Process Criteria and Ingredient Standard of
Livestock Products published by MFDS.

        pH and sensory evaluation
        The pH of homogenized ice cream was determined using a digital pH meter (Model
AM-7, Nissei, Japan). Sensory evaluation of the ice cream samples was conducted
by ten panelists. Visual acceptability, texture (in mouth, expressed as
juiciness), color, aroma flavor or taste and overall impression were rated based
on the preference using a 9-point hedonic scale (1: extremely dislike to 9:
extremely like). Off-odor analysis was carried out using a nine point scale
where 1: absent or poor characteristic to 9: too intense or excellent. Panelists
were motivated to express criticisms on the score sheets used for the sensory
evaluation (Lebesi and Tzia, 2011; Meilgaard et al., 1991). All analyses were
performed in triplicate.

        Estimation of shelf-life by accelerated tests
        In general, actual testing is the primary method used to determine shelf life.
However, if the shelf-life of a product is more than three months, shelf-life
tests can take a long time and would be expensive. Therefore, accelerated
shelf-life testing is applied to a variety of products to estimate change in
characteristics over a short period of time. Accelerated shelf-life testing was
used to study the changes in pH, microbiology, and sensory characteristics of
ice cream by the application of a kinetic approach and, based on the
observations, its shelf life was estimated. Accelerated shelf-life tests allow
estimation of shelf lives in a short period of time using experimental
conditions that are harsher than the actual distribution conditions. Results
obtained from these experiments are used to estimate shelf-life using the
Arrhenius equation. Arrhenius equation was used to choose the sell-by date. The
Arrhenius equation is as follows:

              ln
              &#xA0;K
              =
              &#x2212;
              (

                E
                a

              /R)
              &#xD7;
              1/T
              +
              ln&#xA0;A

        This equation was used for each indicator. In the equation, k is the reaction
rate constant, A is the constant, Ea is the activation energy
(kcal/mol), R is the universal gas constant (R=1.987
cal&#xB7;mol&#x2013;1&#xB7;k&#x2013;1), and T is
the absolute temperature (K). (Haralampu et al.,
1985; Singh, 1994)

        Statistical analysis
        Statistical analysis was carried out on all variables, and was measured using the
General Linear Model (GLM) procedure in SAS software (SAS, 2011). A software
program using Duncan&#x2019;s multiple range test to compare treatment means was
applied. A value of p&lt;0.05 was considered statistically significant. All
data were expressed as mean&#xB1;SD.

      Results and Discussion

        Microbiological analysis
        Changes in the microbial growth of ice cream during storage periods at
&#x2013;18&#x2103;, &#x2013;6&#x2103;, &#x2013;1&#x2103;, and 4&#x2103; for 109
days are presented in Table 1. During
this time, the characteristics changed with microbiological, pH, and sensory
characteristics. The initial aerobic plate count of sample I1 was
1.00&#xB1;0.02 Log CFU/mL. After 109 days, values were 1.47&#xB1;0.12 Log
CFU/mL, 2.66&#xB1;0.01 Log CFU/mL, and 4.02&#xB1;0.05 Log CFU/mL
&#x2013;18&#x2103;, &#x2013;6&#x2103;, and &#x2013;1&#x2103;, respectively;
after 53 days, the value was 4.49&#xB1;0.02 Log CFU/mL at 4&#x2103;. The
initial value for sample I2 was 1.20&#xB1;0.05 Log CFU/mL. After 109 days, the
aerobic plate count values were 1.34&#xB1;0.06 Log CFU/mL, 2.81&#xB1;0.07
Log CFU/mL, and 3.88&#xB1;0.01 Log CFU/mL at &#x2013;18&#x2103;,
&#x2013;6&#x2103;, and &#x2013;1&#x2103;, respectively; after 53 days, the value
was 2.72&#xB1;0.04 Log CFU/mL at 4&#x2103; (p&lt;0.05) (Table 1). Consistent with these
observations, Kim et al. (2005) reported
that total aerobic count of a commercially available ice cream was detected to
be 1e2 Log CFU/g in Korea. In this study, coliform, Listeria
monocytogenes, and Staphylococcus aureus were not
detected at any storage temperature during whole period. The legal
characteristics limit was defined according to the Process Criteria and
Ingredient Standard of Livestock Products described by the MFDS (2015). The maximum acceptable levels
for total aerobic counts is n=5, c=2, m=10,000, and M=100,000; for coliform
counts is less than n=5, c=2, and m=100; and for Listeria
monocytogenes is less than n=5, c=2, m=0, and M=0/25 g. The
non-legal characteristics limit was calculated based on a regression equation
using Y values for each characteristic indicator, and X values for each sensory
evaluation; a value of 5 points (characteristics limit of sensory evaluation
using a nine-point hedonic scale) was substituted for sensory ability. The
shelf-life was then predicted based on a regression equation using Y values for
the indicator, and X values for the storage period after substituting the
characteristics limit. The shelf-life was estimated as the shortest time to
reach the characteristics limit as assessed by characteristics indicators.

        Sensory evaluation
        Sensory shelf-life studies usually involve measuring the intensity of different
sensory characteristics throughout storage period, until they reach a failure
criteria or cut-off point, which corresponds to the maximum tolerable
deterioration (Gimenez et al., 2012).
Numerous studies have used sensory evaluation as an indicator of food
characteristics (Lu et al., 2011; Park, 2013; Peryam and Pilgrim, 1957). Changes in the sensory characteristics of
ice cream are presented in Table 2 and
3. Sensory evaluation was performed
using a 9-point hedonic scale (MFDS,
2015); the evaluation criteria were defined such that the initial
characteristics level was 9 points, and the characteristics limit was 5 points.
Sensory characteristics decreased significantly during the experimental period
(p&lt;0.05), and decreased more rapidly at higher storage temperatures
(Derossi et al., 2016). The sensory
evaluation of I1 and I2 began to change after 5 days at &#x2013;6&#x2103;,
&#x2013;1&#x2103;, and 4&#x2103;, but were unchanged on storage at
&#x2013;18&#x2103;. The sensory characteristics of I1 remained above 5 points
when stored at &#x2013;18&#x2103; and &#x2013;6&#x2103;, and for 32 days and 18
days when stored at &#x2013;1&#x2103; and 4&#x2103;, respectively. The sensory
characteristics of I2 remained greater than 5 points when stored at
&#x2013;18&#x2103; and &#x2013;6&#x2103;, and for 57 days and 39 days when
stored at &#x2013;1&#x2103; and 4&#x2103;, respectively.

        Estimation of the shelf-life of ice cream by accelerated tests
        Accelerated shelf-life testing is used a variety of products with long expiration
period to rapidly estimate changes in characteristics. (Breda et al., 2012; Chandler
and McMeekin, 1989; Lee et al.,
2006; Taoukis et al., 1999).
Initially, the changes in characteristics displayed first-order kinetics.
Instead of a separate estimate of the reaction rate (k) at different
temperatures followed by use of Arrhenius equation to estimate the other
parameters, a one-step multiple linear regression, which fit data versus time
for all tested temperatures, was followed. The influence of temperature on the
reaction rate was described using the modified Arrhenius equation. Regression
equation, and value of r2 date for ice cream at &#x2013;18&#x2103;,
&#x2013;6&#x2103;, &#x2013;1&#x2103;, and 4&#x2103; are shown in Table 4. The date of attaining
characteristics limit for ice cream sample I1, with respect to each
characteristics criteria &#x2013;18&#x2103;, &#x2013;16&#x2103;,
&#x2013;1&#x2103;, and 4&#x2103; was as follows: total aerobic counts, 433.61
months, 15.51 months, 4.19 months, and 1.18 months; pH, 24.27 months, 4.17
months, 0.98 months, and 1.88 months; sensory evaluation, 626.68 months, 5.51
months, 0.87 months, and 0.15 months, respectively. The shelf-life was defined
as the earliest date among all the dates of attaining characteristics limit when
each characteristics criteria reached to its limit. Shelf-life of ice cream I1
was estimated to be 24.27 months at &#x2013;18&#x2103;, 4.17 months at
&#x2013;6&#x2103;, 0.87 months at &#x2013;1&#x2103;, and 0.15 months at
4&#x2103;. The date of attaining characteristics limit for ice cream sample I2,
with respect to each characteristics criteria at &#x2013;18&#x2103;,
&#x2013;6&#x2103;, &#x2013;1&#x2103;, and 4&#x2103; was follows: total aerobic
counts, 27.98 months, 5.09 months, 2.62 months, and 1.38 months; pH, 36.32
months, 2.29 months, 0.39 months, and 0.44 months; sensory evaluation, 72.86
months, 2.72 months, 0.75 months, and 0.22 months, respectively. The shelf-life
was defined as the earliest date among all dates of attaining characteristics
limit when each characteristics criteria reached to its limit. Shelf-life of ice
cream sample I2 was estimated to be 27.98 months at &#x2013;18&#x2103;, 2.29
months at &#x2013;6&#x2103;, 0.39 months at &#x2013;1&#x2103;, and 0.22 months
at 4&#x2103; (Table 5). Finally,
summarizing the results, Table 6 shows
the shelf-life of ice cream was estimated after 24.27 months at
&#x2013;18&#x2103;, 2.29 months at &#x2013;6&#x2103;, 0.39 months at
&#x2013;1&#x2103;, and 0.15 months at 4&#x2103;. However, the shelf-lives
estimated in this study cannot be applied to all ice creams, because many
factors, including the manufacturing process and packing materials, also play
vital roles. All food expiration dates could be established as self-applied
safety factor by each company. In addition, to determine the shelf-life, other
factors such as storage conditions, temperature of storage, etc. should be
considered. For ice cream, the expiration date is not mandatory because ice
cream is circulated in the frozen state at &#x2013;18&#x2103; or less, with
minimal risk of deterioration. But, the consumer insists on an expiration date
owing to consumer&#x2019;s own safety and right to know (Da Silva et al., 2014; Jeon
et al., 2013). However, all ice cream samples could not be applied,
therefore, this study aims to obtain basic information to establish
shelf-life.
