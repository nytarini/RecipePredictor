Ghrelin is a stomach secreted hormone, believed to play an important role in energy balance and in food intake. Experimental studies have shown a positive effect of ghrelin on bone metabolism, but both in vivo and clinical findings have been contradictory. We aimed to investigate the effect of ghrelin on volumetric BMD in a large cohort of elderly subjects.

Methods
We have studied 401 women (mean age 75.1 years, range 65–94) and 306 men (mean age 73.9 years, range 65–94) from the InChianti study, which included measurements of BMD using quantitative CT of the tibia and of body composition using bio impedancemetry. Serum ghrelin was measured using ELISA. We excluded participants with diabetes, hyperthyroidism, using hormone replacement or glucocorticoid therapy. We evaluated the correlation of ghrelin with total, trabecular, and cortical BMD using Pearson's coefficient, and linear regression models to estimate the association between ghrelin and BMD controlling for potential confounders.

Results
In women, after correction for potential confounders, ghrelin was associated with trabecular BMD (β = 7.08, P&lt;0.02), but not with total or cortical BMD. In men, adjusted multivariable models showed a nearly significant association between serum ghrelin and trabecular BMD (β = 4.99, P = 0.069) and no association with either cortical or total BMD.

Conclusions
Serum ghrelin is positively correlated with trabecular BMD in a cohort of elderly healthy Italian women. The fact that trabecular is more metabolically active than cortical bone and the larger number of females might explain this selective association.

   Introduction
Extensive epidemiological studies have reported that body fat is strongly correlated to bone mass [1,2]. In fact, both male and female obese subjects have generally increased bone mineral density (BMD) [3]. Adipose tissue is the main site of aromatization of androgen to estrogen contributing to increased BMD in both postmenopausal women and men [4]. Moreover, a greater body weight enhances mechanical loading on bone, stimulating bone formation and, consequently, leading to increased bone mass [1,2]. However, an important association between obesity and low trauma fractures has recently been reported in post menopausal women, challenging the classical view of obesity as a factor promoting bone health [5].

The relationship between fat and bone is complex and adipocyte-dependent hormonal factors may influence BMD independently from mechanical loading [6,7]. Leptin, in particular, enhances osteoblast differentiation and inhibits osteoclast formation in vitro. Unfortunately, in vivo studies have not found comparably strong correlations between circulating leptin and BMD, casting doubts on the real effect of leptin on bone mass in humans [8–14]. Adiponectin has been also widely studied in both in vitro and in vivo: knock-out mice for adiponectin have slightly higher bone mass than controls only at 14 weeks of life, while clinical studies have found either no association with BMD or an inverse correlation with BMD, mostly in elderly [15–17].

In the last years attention has been focused also on Ghrelin, a 28-amino acid polypeptide mainly secreted from neuroendocrine cells of the fundus of the stomach and in smaller amounts from renal, pituitary, and hypothalamus cells [18,19]. Ghrelin is believed to play an important role in energy balance and in food intake. Its serum concentration is inversely associated to BMI, and increased in diet-induced weight loss [18,19]. However, Ghrelin may have also an effect on bone homeostasis; in fact, recent studies showed that Ghrelin may be produced by osteoblasts, and Ghrelin receptors (GHS-R) were detected in both rat and human bone cells [20]. Although Ghrelin has a positive effect on osteoblast proliferation and differentiation [21–24] in vitro, in vivo studies on animals have been contradictory showing either no association with bone mass in mice [21] or a positive effect in rats with increased osteoblast-like cells number, expression of osteoblast differentiation markers, and BMD [20]. Findings from clinical studies on humans, in which BMD has been evaluated using dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry (DEXA), are contradictory as well, even in large and well characterized cohorts [25–28].

The inconsistent results coming from clinical studies might in part be due to methodological problems. Indeed, the populations studied were too small [25] or covered a range of age including the menopausal transition with its dramatic, but highly variable effects on BMD [26]. Furthermore, the methods most commonly used to measure BMD, i.e. DEXA and single photon absorptiometry, do not distinguish cortical from trabecular bone [27,28]. Since these components of the bone have different structure, metabolic profile and sensitivity to age [29], we carried out this study to investigate the relationship between Ghrelin serum concentration and BMD separately for cortical and trabecular bone.

Methods
Study population
We used data from the InChianti study, which was designed to investigate the factors contributing to the decline of mobility in older persons. The participants in the study were all Caucasian and randomly selected from the populations of two town areas in the Chianti region: Greve in Chianti and Bagno a Ripoli. The Italian National Institute of Research and Care on Aging ethical committee approved the study protocol. Participants received an extensive description of the study and signed an informed participation consent that included permission to conduct analyses on the biological specimens collected and stored. For those unable to fully consent because of cognitive or physical problems, surrogate consent was also obtained from a close relative. The eligible participants were interviewed at their homes by trained study researchers using a structured questionnaire aimed at investigating their health status, their physical and cognitive performance, and other factors possibly related to loss of independence in late life. The interview was followed by a physical examination at the study clinic.

Biochemistry
Serum was drawn in early morning after 12 h of fasting, and stored at −80 °C. Ghrelin was analyzed using a commercial kit (Human Ghrelin ELISA kit, Phoenix Pharmaceuticals, Inc, Belmont, CA, USA). Measures are expressed in ng/mL with an intra-assay CV of 5% and inter-assay less than 14%. Range of 0.1–100 ng/mL. Morning fasting ghrelin levels are strongly correlated with daily AUC ghrelin value in lean and obese individuals [30]. Thus, the single ghrelin measurement can be considered representative of the average ghrelin secretion and has been adopted by the vast majority of previous studies.

Estimation of BMD
BMD was estimated using peripheral quantitative computed tomography (pQCT) using a XCT 2000 device (Stratec Medizintechnik, Pforzheim, Germany). The tibio-talar joint was identified using a pQCT longitudinal scout and used as an anatomic marker for the identification of measurements sites. Standard (2.5 mm thickness) transverse scans were obtained at 4% and 38% of tibial length to measure trabecular and cortical bone densities, respectively. The cross-sectional images obtained by pQCT were analyzed using BonAlyse software (BonAlyse Oy, Jyvaskyla, Finland) that automatically identifies cortical and trabecular bone and assesses its density. Areas with density values &gt;710 mg/cm3 were considered as cortical bone [12], whereas areas with density between 180 and 710 mg/cm3 were considered as trabecular bone.

Sample selection
From the 1227 participants who had measured Ghrelin serum concentration, we excluded those younger than 65 years (N = 256), those without BMD measurement (N = 95), and those using corticosteroids or diagnosed with diabetes or hyperthyroidism (N = 141). Finally, we excluded women using estrogen replacement therapy (N = 28). The final sample size was 707.

Analytic approach
All analyses were performed separately in men and women. As a first step, we described the demographic characteristics of our sample as well as the distribution of the factors potentially affecting bone mass density. Among these, we considered physical activity between the ages of 40 and 60 and considered as sedentary those who performed less than 1/2 h/week of moderate or less than 4 h/week of moderate physical exercise. We also took into account alcohol consumption and cumulative smoking history (pack-years), the body mass index (BMI), the renal function expressed by the creatinine clearance measured using the 24-h collection method, and the serum concentrations of 25-OH vitamin D.

The relationship between BMD and Ghrelin serum concentration was evaluated (separately for trabecular and cortical BMD) using scatterplots and calculating the Pearson's linear correlation coefficient. We then evaluated the association between BMD and Ghrelin adjusted for potential confounders using a multivariable linear regression analysis. The adequacy for such models was investigated by visually inspecting the plots of residuals vs. predictors. Finally, to directly evaluate the role of gender on this relationship we repeated the regression analysis including gender and a gender Ghrelin interaction term.

All the analyses were performed using SAS V9 (SAS Inc., Cary NC).

Results
The sample was made up by 401 women (mean age 75.1 years, range 65–94) and 306 men (mean age 73.9 years, range 65–94). The main characteristics of the sample are reported in Table 1. The average BMI was 27 for both males and females, while males were much more exposed to two risk factors for osteoporosis, age and smoking. On the other hand, males had better creatinine clearance and higher vitamin D serum level. As expected, all measures of BMD were greater in males. The average Ghrelin concentration was 0.28 ng/mL (SD: 0.05, range: 0.10–0.39) in women and 0.27 ng/mL (SD: 0.05, range: 0.11–0.39) in men.

As shown in Figs. 1–3, in both men and women there was no correlation between any measure of BMD and Ghrelin. However, multivariable analysis disclosed some associations. As shown in Table 2, in women the adjusted multivariable models showed that trabecular BMD increased on average of 7.1 mg/cm3 for each 0.05 ng/mL increase of Ghrelin serum concentration (P = 0.02). The only other parameter significantly associated with trabecular BMD was the BMI (beta = 1.81, P = 0.014). Cortical BMD was associated with BMI (beta = 2.15, P = 0.02) and, more weakly, with physical activity level (beta = −18.6, P = 0.062) and serum concentration of 25-OH vitamin D (beta = 0.27, P = 0.061).

In men (Table 3), after adjustment for potential confounders, we found that Ghrelin was weakly correlated with trabecular BMD (beta = 4.99, P = 0.069) and not associated with cortical BMD. Other variables associated with trabecular BMD were BMI (beta = 3.75, P&lt;0.001) and smoking exposure (beta = −0.423, P = 0.001). These two variables were also associated with cortical BMD.

Ghrelin levels were not significantly correlated with total bone circumference, total bone area, cortical and medullary area, in both males and females, even after adjustment for BMI, age, smoking and vitamin D.

Analyzing BMD according to ghrelin quartiles, there was a significant difference in women at the total and trabecular levels (P&lt;0.05 and P&lt;0.01, respectively, Fig. 4). No significant results were found at the cortical level and at any sites in men (Fig. 5).

Finally, the interaction term between gender and Ghrelin was not statistically significant in models having either trabecular or cortical BMD as dependent variables.

Discussion
This is the first large study investigating the relationship between Ghrelin and bone density using pQCT. Our study shows a positive correlation between Ghrelin and trabecular BMD in women.

Among the few clinical studies available, our results in males are partly in agreement with those of Gonnelli who has recently described a significant, positive, effect of Ghrelin on femoral neck BMD in elderly men [31]. Notably, patients recruited by Gonnelli are from the same geographical area of ours. On the contrary, using DEXA measurement, no significant effects of Ghrelin on BMD at any bone sites were found in 80 Korean middle aged males [25] or in the Rancho Bernardo cohort after adjusting for BMI and age [28]. Few evidences are available on women, and our results are not in agreement with those reported in the Rancho Bernardo study, where no significant association between ghrelin and BMD at any sites or with bone loss after 4 years of follow up was found in postmenopausal women [28]. The younger age and lower BMI of the subjects recruited in Rancho Bernardo study may explain these differences. However, our data are in agreement with those of Gonnelli (obtained in the same region) and with the Italian public health references for the elderly Tuscany population (27 ± 4 in males and 28 ± 4 in women,). It should be also noted that we have measured tibial volumetric BMD and mechanical and structural factors may have influenced these differences. Considering the available studies, our data provide more detailed information, given that pQCT allows to analyze separately cortical from trabecular bone, which is more metabolically active and, in general, more responsive to circulating factors [24]. Moreover, using this approach we have avoided another limitation of DEXA, i.e. the influence of body and bone size on measurements. Our observation that Ghrelin levels were not different between sexes is in agreement with some previous reports [30] but contradicts others where gender differences were found [21]. At any rate, besides the Rancho Bernardo studies, the majority of available studies have limited numbers of participants, and men and women frequently are not matched for age [28].

While the evidence from population studies is controversial, most of laboratory and clinical studies support our finding of a positive association between Ghrelin and trabecular BMD in elderly women. Indeed, several experimental studies suggest that Ghrelin influences bone metabolism, promoting osteoblast proliferation and differentiation and calcified accumulation [20–23]. The in-vitro findings have been confirmed in animal models: intraperitoneal infusion of Ghrelin in rats determined a significant increase of total femoral BMD compared to placebo [20]. Considering that Ghrelin exerts its central action through activation of the GH-IGF-I axis, the independent effect of Ghrelin on BMD was tested also in GH-deficient mice, revealing that Ghrelin augmented BMD also in this experimental model [20] Other animal studies have shown that reduction in Ghrelin levels after gastrectomy is associated to osteopenia, that is not reverted after Ghrelin administration [32]. However, post-gastrectomy osteopenia in rodents was prevented by preserving 10–30% of the oxyntic gland area, the Ghrelin producing region in the stomach [33]. Similarly, obese patients receiving laparoscopic gastric bypass surgery have low serum Ghrelin levels that cause an increase in bone resorption and reduction in bone mass [34–36]. These results indicate an independent, positive, role played by gherlin on bone metabolism, likely stimulating bone formation. Finally, Ghrelin has also been reported to promote appetite for energy dense food in a mouse experimental model [37] and this might be one of the factors explaining the association we found between Ghrelin and trabecular BMD.

The major limitation of this study is its cross-sectional design. Given the complexity of the mechanisms involved, the causal role of Ghrelin on trabecular BMD cannot be established solely on the basis of these data. However, the available experimental evidence is in support of a direct role of Ghrelin on BMD [20–23]. A related issue is the fact that we analyzed people in their seventh to tenth decade, while it is known that the critical period for BMD accrual is in the second–third decade of life [29]. Furthermore, we were unable to separately analyze the active isoform of ghrelin (octanoylate) from the inactive one [38].

Finally, we did not take into account the use of anti-resorptive therapy. It is unlikely, however, that these drug influence Ghrelin concentration, and therefore that our findings can be substantially affected by this bias.

In conclusion, we found that Ghrelin levels were significantly associated with trabecular BMD in both elderly male and female subjects. This finding stemmed from a multivariable analysis including several potential determinants of BMD in an accurately characterized population. Research is needed to clarify whether it is limited to older age and, in this event, whether interventions promoting Ghrelin secretion might improve BMD in elderly subjects with or at risk for osteoporosis.
