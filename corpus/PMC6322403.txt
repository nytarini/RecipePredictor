   Breastfeeding has been associated with many beneficial outcomes in children. Among other benefits, it has been linked to lower infant mortality1, lower risk of sudden infant death syndrome (SIDS)2, lower incidence of certain types of cancer3, and even higher intelligence4. In terms of atopy and respiratory diseases, it has been associated with decreased risk of lower respiratory infections (LRIs)5 and childhood asthma (particularly over the first few years of life)6, 7. On the other hand, a recent meta-analysis found no strong evidence that breastfeeding helps prevent food allergies, eczema, or allergic rhinitis8. Moreover, many studies looking at breastfeeding and respiratory outcomes recorded breastfeeding retrospectively or failed to thoroughly control for potentially important confounders9.

Whether these benefits extend into adulthood is still an open question. For example, a history of breastfeeding may not affect the risk of high total cholesterol, high blood pressure, or cardiovascular mortality10. Unfortunately, studies evaluating the association between breastfeeding and asthma in adults are scarce and have provided somewhat concerning results. In the Dunedin cohort, Sears et al reported an ~83% increased risk of asthma at 9–26 years of age among participants who were breastfed in infancy compared to those who were not breastfed11. Likewise, the Tasmanian Asthma Study reported that exclusively breastfed children (of mothers with a history of atopy) had 46% to 83% higher risk of asthma at 14, 32, and 44 years of age, with similar results for allergic rhinitis12. However, these cohorts were recruited at 3 and 7 years of age, respectively, and thus breastfeeding information may have been subject to recall bias.

In their study, Gerhart et al.13 go a step further to answer the question of whether breastfeeding is associated with respiratory symptoms later in life. Using data from the Tucson Children’s Respiratory Study (TCRS) –perhaps the most influential epidemiological birth cohort of childhood asthma– the authors evaluate the association between breastfeeding duration and the presence of recurrent cough in 735 cohort participants at ages 22, 26, and 32 years. They report that breastfeeding for ≥4 months was associated with ~28% lower risk of recurrent cough during early adulthood (adjusted odds ratio 0.72, 95%CI 0.56–0.90) after adjusting for sex, race/ethnicity, and participant smoking, as well as parental age, education, smoking, and asthma. The results are very interesting and certainly point to very long-term effects of breastfeeding on respiratory symptoms. Chief among the strengths of the study are the use of detailed data collected prospectively during infancy, the non-selected nature of the original cohort, and the relatively high participation rate (~59% of the original sample) even three decades later. The study limitations are clearly disclosed by the authors and include the differences between mothers who breastfed and those who did not, the use of self-report to collect adult symptoms (including the outcome), and the fact that subjects who were breastfed for longer as infants were more likely to still be in the cohort at age 32 years.

Exactly how might longer breastfeeding protect from recurrent cough thirty years later is not clear. Perhaps the simplest explanation would be that breastfeeding is associated with lower risk of asthma, and thus with lower odds of cough; however, the authors report no association between breastfeeding duration and adult asthma, and that additional adjustment for asthma did not alter their results. As the authors suggest, another plausible explanation may include protection from early-life viral LRIs among infants who were breastfed for longer, which may in turn protect from respiratory symptoms later in life. In this study early LRI-related wheezing and RSV infections were not associated with recurrent cough in adulthood, although there were some non-significant “trends” (RSV LRI vs. cough at 22 years, p=0.07; and childhood wheezing phenotype vs. cough at 22–32 years, p=0.06). Thus, we may not be able to completely rule out the potential mediating role of protection from viral lower respiratory infections or early wheeze. Another possibility would be that immune globulins or other factors in breastmilk may modulate the microbiome1415 or induce epigenetic changes16 during a time period that is crucial for the infant’s immune system development and maturation. Infant feeding patterns have been associated with other diseases, such as Crohn’s disease, ulcerative colitis17, or diabetes18, in which immunity and inflammation also play prominent roles.

Of interest, in the study by Gerhart et al participants with earlier introduction of formula were more likely to report tobacco smoking at age 22 years (but not at 26 or 32 years), and participant smoking was associated with recurrent cough (and with wheezing) at all three timepoints. Moreover, maternal and paternal smoking were associated with shorter breastfeeding duration. While the statistical models were adjusted for participant and parental smoking, these associations may reflect unmeasured or unknown factors that may partly affect the risk of recurrent cough. The same may be true for data completeness: participants who were breastfed longer were more likely to still be in the study at age 32. While this only happened at last time point, that was the visit with the most statistically robust association, and perhaps this may signal that there are some unmeasured characteristics of study participants that associate with breastfeeding and that could partially explain the risk of recurrent cough. Other potential confounders include rhinitis, chronic sinusitis, and heartburn, all of which were more frequently reported by subjects with recurrent cough. However, adjusting for these characteristics did not alter the results, making it less likely that these diseases are responsible for the observed associations.

Finally, another interesting possibility would be that lung function (or lung function deficits) might mediate the reported results. Given the association between breastfeeding duration and FVC at age 16 years in the TCRS cohort19, the authors adjusted the models in the current study for FVC and found no significant changes in their results. However, they did not evaluate FEV1 or FEV1/FVC. This is particularly important because breastfeeding has been associated with higher FEF50 in adolescents20 and with higher FEV1/FVC in young adults21 and, as the authors note, recurrent cough in older adults has been associated with airway obstruction22. One could hypothesize that breastfeeding may lead to improved lung function early on (or to reduced risk of airway obstruction) which is in turn reflected in a reduced risk of chronic cough later in life.

A thought-provoking question that arises but remains unanswered is whether results like these provide a glimpse of a link between protective (or risk) factors for childhood asthma and those for adult lung diseases such as chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). The “Dutch hypothesis” was first proposed in 1961 to suggest that asthma and COPD had common origins and their clinical expressions were part of a “spectrum”23. Could it be that breastfeeding is somehow a piece of the puzzle? More importantly, one of the mains idea formulated with the Dutch hypothesis was to not simply apply a disease label but to carefully characterize patients (what we now call “phenotyping”) taking into account the interplay between host and environmental factors23. We are all certainly hopeful that the TCRS and other long-term birth or early-life cohorts will continue to follow their altruistic participants for many years to come, and will continue to shed light on the evolution of respiratory health and disease throughout the lifespan.
