        Iranian Ultrafiltered White cheese was produced by using different blends of coagulants (100:0, 75:25, 50:50, 25:75 and 0:100; Rhizomucor miehei and camel chymosin, respectively) and ripened for 90&#xA0;days. The effect of different combinations of these coagulants on chemical composition, proteolysis and residual coagulant activity of the cheeses were studied. The results showed that pH, fat-in-dry matter, salt-in-dry matter and protein contents of the cheeses were significantly influenced by type and concentration of the coagulants. The difference between proteolytic activities of the two coagulants resulted in different levels of proteolysis in the cheeses. A direct relationship was determined between using higher concentrations of R. miehei and increasing the hydrolysis of &#x3B1;s1-casein in the cheeses, during ripening. The residual coagulant activity was influenced by the type and concentration of the coagulant as well. In conclusion, R. miehei provided a higher level of proteolysis and residual coagulant activity compared with camel chymosin.
