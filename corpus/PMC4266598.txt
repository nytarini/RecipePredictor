There is evidence that sub-clinical vitamin B12 (B12) deficiency is common in India. Vegetarianism is prevalent and therefore meat consumption is low. Our objective was to explore the contribution of B12 source-foods and maternal B12 status during pregnancy to plasma B12 concentrations.

Design
Maternal plasma B12 concentrations were measured during pregnancy. Children’s dietary intakes and plasma B12 concentrations were measured at age 9.5 years; B12 and total energy intakes were calculated using food composition databases. We used linear regression to examine associations between maternal B12 status and children’s intakes of B12 and B12 source-foods, and children’s plasma B12 concentrations.

Setting
South Indian city of Mysore and surrounding rural areas.

Subjects
Children from the Mysore Parthenon Birth Cohort (n=512, 47.1% male).

Results
Three percent of children were B12 deficient (&lt;150 pmol/l). A further 14% had ‘marginal’ B12 concentrations (150-221 pmol/l). Children’s total daily B12 intake and consumption frequency of meat and fish, and micronutrient-enriched beverages were positively associated with plasma B12 concentrations (p=0.006, p=0.01 and p=0.04, adjusted for socio-economic indicators and maternal B12 status). Maternal pregnancy plasma B12 was associated with children’s plasma B12 concentrations, independent of current B12 intakes (p&lt;0.001). Milk and curd (yoghurt) intakes were unrelated to B12 status.

Conclusions
Meat and fish are important B12 sources in this population. Micronutrient-enriched beverages appear to be important sources in our cohort, but their high sugar content necessitates care in their recommendation. Improving maternal B12 status in pregnancy may improve Indian children’s status.


   INTRODUCTION
Vitamin B12 (B12), or cobalamin, plays a key role in cellular metabolism and DNA synthesis.(1) It is produced in nature only by microbial synthesis, and animal products are the principal dietary sources for humans. Uncooked plant-based foods contaminated with B12-synthesising bacteria, and fermented foods, may also be important sources.(2,3) In India, vegetarian diets have been associated with an increased risk of B12 deficiency, and a high prevalence of B12 deficiency has been attributed to low meat intakes for religious or economic reasons.(2,4) Prevalence rates of deficiency of 47-71% have been reported among adults.(4-9) There is no standard definition of deficiency among children and there is a paucity of data on B12 status among Indian children. However, recent studies using adult cut-offs have reported that 2-44% of infants and school-age children are deficient.(10-14) A study in Pune, India showed normal B12 absorption in the majority (90%) of individuals studied.(15)

Severe B12 deficiency, as seen in Pernicious Anaemia, is characterised by megaloblastic anaemia and/or neurologic dysfunction. However, sub-clinical cobalamin deficiency (SCCD) currently defined as asymptomatic, mild metabolic abnormalities, may be of greater public health importance.(16) Recent research has related low B12 status with an increased risk of adiposity and gestational diabetes in India. Low status among Indian and Nepalese mothers during pregnancy was associated with increased insulin resistance in their children.(5,17,18) Vitamin B12 deficiency is associated with raised plasma homocysteine levels, which is a risk factor for cardiovascular disease.(19) There is also evidence of low B12 status being related to increased cognitive decline in elderly people in the USA.(20)

Several studies in low- and middle-income countries have identified significant correlations between dietary intakes of B12 or consumption frequency of B12 rich foods and plasma B12 in early childhood.(13,21-26) The association between diet and plasma B12 concentration among older children remains under-studied. There is also a need to identify affordable and acceptable sources of B12 for the Indian population.

In the current study, the diets of children aged 9.5 years from the Parthenon Birth Cohort, Mysore, India, were assessed using a semi-quantitative food frequency questionnaire from which daily B12 intakes were calculated. We aimed to investigate associations between children’s B12 intake, and frequency of consumption of potential B12 source foods, with biochemical measures of B12. We hypothesised that higher B12 intakes, and more frequent consumption of non-vegetarian foods (meat, fish and eggs) and dairy products (milk, butter and yoghurt) would be associated with higher B12 status. We also examined whether intakes of traditional Indian fermented foods (whose preparation involves microbial activity), and of raw vegetables that may be contaminated with bacteria, were associated with higher B12 concentrations. Maternal B status is correlated with neonatal B12
(19,27,28) status. We therefore assessed whether maternal B12 concentrations in plasma samples collected during the pregnancy of each child were related to children’s B12 concentrations at 9.5 years. The primary outcome in all analyses was children’s plasma B12 level.

METHODS
Participants and setting
Details of the Mysore Parthenon Cohort have been published elsewhere.(29,30) In brief, between June 1997 and August 1998, pregnant women attending the antenatal clinic of Holdsworth Memorial Hospital (HMH) and living in the city of Mysore or surrounding rural areas were recruited to the study if they fulfilled the following criteria: non-diabetic prior to pregnancy; &lt;32 weeks gestation at time of recruitment; planning to deliver at Holdsworth Memorial Hospital (Figure 1). A total of 1233 women were eligible for the study and 830 (67%) agreed to participate, of whom 663 delivered live, singleton babies without major congenital abnormalities at HMH. In 2007, 539 (81%) children attended for follow-up at 9.5 years (56 refused, 8 were not traced, 26 moved away, 25 died and nine were withdrawn from the study because of severe chronic medical conditions). Dietary data were available for 538 children, and of these, plasma B12 concentrations were available for 527.

The study was conducted according to the guidelines laid down in the Declaration of Helsinki and all procedures were approved by the [Institution’s] Research Ethics Committee. Written informed consent was obtained from parents, and assent from the children.

Socio-demographic factors
Maternal education and socio-economic status (SES) were recorded, the latter using the Standard of Living Index (SLI) questionnaire developed for the second Indian National Family Health Survey (NFHS-2).(31) This uses information on household possessions, house type, drinking water source and sanitation facilities to derive a SLI score. A higher score denotes higher SES. The NFHS-2 categorised SLI scores of ≥25 as ‘high’ standard of living.(31) Children were classified as ‘urban’ or ‘rural’ based on their address at 9.5 years; towns with a population &gt;100,000 were defined as urban.(32)

Anthropometry
Height was measured to the nearest 0.1 cm using a wall mounted stadiometer (Microtoise, CMS instruments, London, UK). Weight was measured to the nearest 100 g using digital scales (Salter, Kent, UK). Standard deviation (SD) scores for height-for-age and body mass index (BMI)-for-age were calculated relative to WHO Growth Reference data.(33) BMI-for-age SD scores were used to identify underweight, overweight and obese children (&lt;−2, &gt;+1 and ≤+2, or &gt;+2, respectively).(33)

Biochemical measurements
Fasting venous blood samples were collected at 28.6 weeks (25th, 75th percentiles: 27.9, 30.6; min, max: 23.7, 35.1) gestation from mothers and stored for 8 years at −80°C.(34) Children’s samples were collected at 9.5 years. Blood was separated within 2 hours of venesection and plasma aliquots were stored at −80°C before transfer to the laboratory. B12 concentrations were measured using a microbiological assay at the Diabetes Unit, KEM Hospital Research Centre, Pune, India.(17,23) Intra and inter-assay coefficients of variation were &lt;8%. Children’s haemoglobin concentrations were measured on the day of blood collection using a cell counter (Haematology analyser MEK 6420, Nihon Kohden, Japan) at the HMH Laboratory, Mysore.

B12 deficiency for mothers and children was defined using WHO plasma concentration cut-offs for adults (&lt;150pmol/l). Given the lack of consensus cut-offs for use in children, we also used a definition of ‘marginal’ B12 status (150-221pmol/l).(21,22,35) Anaemia was defined as haemoglobin concentration &lt;11.5 g/dl.(36)

Dietary assessment
A 136-item semi-quantitative interviewer-administered food frequency questionnaire (FFQ) was developed to characterise food and micronutrient intakes in this cohort of children.(23) The FFQ was administered by one of three trained nutritionists, to both the child and one parent (usually the mother). The reference period was a typical month. Consumption frequency was recorded as number of times eaten daily, weekly or monthly. Portion size was quantified using common household utensils. In cases where units or frequency data were missing (&lt;2%), a nutritionist assigned the most frequently reported response. Current medication use, including micronutrient supplements, was also recorded.

Foods on the FFQ that were considered potential sources of B12 were grouped into the following categories: flesh foods (meat and fish); eggs; curd (yoghurt) foods; dairy foods; micronutrient-enriched beverages; fermented foods; raw vegetables. These categories were not mutually exclusive.

Calculation of nutrient intakes
Daily energy, protein and B12 intakes were calculated using published databases. The nutrient content of raw or ‘non-prepared foods’ (e.g. apple, almond, milk) was assigned based on values published by the Indian National Institute of Nutrition (NIN).(37) If data were not available for a particular food, we obtained values from UK and US databases, scrutinised in that order.(38,39) We used weighed records to calculate the nutrient content of approximately 60% of the prepared foods. For each food item, three different homes were visited by the research team. Raw ingredients and the cooked food were weighed. Calculations were then performed using the nutrient content of the raw ingredients, with the databases’ recommended conversion factors for cooking losses (e.g. 20% loss of B12 when cooking meat).(38) Mean values across the three households were used. For shop-bought ready-prepared foods, (40% of prepared foods), published databases were used to identify a food as close as possible in nutritional content to the item on the FFQ and the corresponding values were used (e.g. packaged skimmed milk).(38-40)

The units used in portion-size estimates (spoonful, bowlful etc.) of each food were weighed, to give grams/portion. The nutrient content per portion size was then derived. Daily nutrient intakes were calculated by multiplying the number of units consumed per day by the nutrient content per unit. Nutrient density was also calculated to give a standardised B12 intake estimate in μg/1000kCal.

Data analysis
Analyses were performed using STATA version 12 (StataCorp, Texas). Descriptive characteristics (maternal height and B12 status in pregnancy, gender ratio, birthweight, child’s weight and height at 5 years) were compared between children included in the analysis and those excluded or not followed up, using Wilcoxon rank-sum or t-tests and Pearson’s X2 tests. Associations between socio-demographic factors (religion, SLI-score, urban/rural residence and maternal education) and physiological factors (children’s gender and anthropometry) with dietary characteristics at 9.5yrs were examined using Spearman’s correlation, Wilcoxon rank-sum, Kruskal-Wallis equality-of-populations rank, or Pearson’s X2 tests. Crude associations between dietary characteristics, haemoglobin concentration or maternal plasma B12 during pregnancy and children’s plasma B12 concentrations were examined using Spearman’s correlation or Kruskal-Wallis equality-of-populations rank tests. A Kruskal-Wallis test was used to compare plasma B12 concentrations of children with low B12 intakes by thirds of maternal B12.

Linear regression analyses, with corresponding likelihood ratio tests (LRTs), were used to examine associations between exposures (B12 intake, B12 dietary density and frequencies of food consumption) and outcomes. Non-parametric variables were transformed for analysis. Covariates considered were child’s gender, age, height, BMI, urban/rural residence, religion, SLI-score and maternal education. It was decided a priori to include children’s gender, age, height and BMI in all regression models; as these factors influence total daily food intake. SLI-score was included because multivariate analysis showed evidence of an association with plasma B12 concentration independent of diet. We did not adjust for religion or urban/rural residence in the models we present because it was likely that diet was the principal mechanism whereby these factors influence B12 status (e.g. the Hindu religion advocates vegetarianism). However, we did run models including religion and residence as predictor variables. It was decided a priori to adjust for other B12 food-groups in food consumption analyses. Additional models and LRTs were used to examine diet associations independent of maternal B12 concentration in pregnancy and maternal B12 associations independent of diet. To quantify effects of diet on B12 status (categories: low [≤221pmol/l] vs. ‘normal’ [&gt;221pmol/l]), odds ratios, corresponding 95% confidence intervals and Wald test significance values were derived for each B12 intake/density or food consumption third using logistic regression.

RESULTS
Exclusions and comparison of children studied and not studied
Of the 539 children who attended for investigations at 9.5 years, 512 were included in the final analyses where maternal plasma B12 during pregnancy was not considered (Figure 1). Maternal plasma vitamin B12 measures were available for 506. Children taking supplements or tonics containing B12 (n=8) had plasma concentrations higher than other children (476 (247, 638) vs. 311 (250, 401) pmol/l) and were excluded from the analysis. Children with plasma B12 measures &gt;1000pmol/l (n=3) were also excluded. Children with calculated energy intakes ≥5000 kcal (n=4) were excluded. The 512 children studied did not differ from the rest of the cohort in terms of religion, gender ratio, height and BMI at 5 years, or their mothers’ heights (all p&gt;0.05). They were more likely to be urban dwelling (72.5% vs. 63.8%; p=0.009), have heavier birthweight (2.87 kg vs. 2.75 kg; p=0.007) and a lower weight at 5yrs (15.8 kg vs. 16.4 kg; p=0.028) on average compared with the remainder of the cohort.

Description of the cohort
Table 1 summarises the characteristics of the children included in the analysis. Mean (SD) BMI-for-age z-score was −1.20 (1.25). One hundred and twenty-five (24.4%) children were underweight, 18 (3.5%) were overweight and five (1.0%) were obese.(33) Median (IQR) plasma B12 concentration was 312 (251, 400) pmol/l. The prevalence of B12 deficiency (&lt;150 pmol/l) was 2.5%. A further 14.3% had marginal B12 deficiency (150-221 pmol/l). Eighty nine percent of children had a normal haemoglobin concentration. There was no association between plasma B12 and haemoglobin concentrations (p=0.541).

Dietary intakes
The children’s calculated energy intakes ranged from 639 to 4832 kcal/day with a median (IQR) of 2350 (1918, 2847) (Table 1). The median (IQR) calculated B12 intake was 2.9 μg/day (1.6, 4.4), and ranged from 0.1 to 10.0 μg/day. Approximately 23% of children had B12 intakes below the WHO estimated average requirement (EAR) for their age-group (1.5 μg/day).(1)

Few children (7%) reported no consumption of meat, fish or eggs in a typical month (Table 2). Most consumed meat or fish at least once a week, but less than every day. Dairy foods (including milk, butter and yoghurt) were consumed at least several times a week by 86% of the cohort. More than half the children reported consuming milk-based micronutrient-enriched beverages (such as Horlicks or Complan) and generally consumed them at least several times a week. Most children reported consumption of traditional fermented foods (idli and dosa) and raw vegetables. Micronutrient-enriched beverages made the largest contribution to B12 intakes in the cohort (Table 2).

Socio-demographic factors
Fifty seven percent of children were Hindu and 35% were Muslim; 75% were urban-dwelling (Table 1). Higher SES and urban residence were associated with higher B12 intakes (Table 3, p&lt;0.001 for both) and higher consumption frequency of meat and fish, and micronutrient-enriched beverages. Boys had higher B12 intakes (p=0.059), but B12 density in the diet did not differ by gender (Table 3, p=0.717). Although there was no evidence that total B12 intakes differed with religion (p=0.348), meat and fish intakes were lower among Hindu children than children of other faiths and micronutrient-enriched beverage intakes were lowest among Muslim children (Table 3, p&lt;0.001 for both). SES was positively associated with plasma B12 concentrations (p=0.006). Hindu children had lower plasma B12 concentrations than children of other religions (p&lt;0.001). There was no evidence that B12 concentrations differed by urban/rural residence (p=0.124) or by gender (p=0.465).

Diet and plasma B12 concentrations Nutrient intakes
Children with lower B12 intakes or those consuming diets with a lower B12 density had lower plasma B12 concentrations (Table 4), although there was considerable overlap in the plasma B12 ranges when children were divided into groups by B12 intake. The odds ratio (OR) for low B12 status (deficiency or marginal deficiency, ≤221pmol/l) was 1.60 [95% CI 0.84 to 3.04] in the lowest third of B12 intake relative to the highest third. Respective values for B12 dietary density were 3.42 [95% CI 1.69 to 6.93].

Food intakes
Consumption frequencies of non-vegetarian foods (meat, fish and eggs), or flesh foods (meat and fish) were positively associated with plasma B12 concentrations (all p&lt;0.01, Table 4). Children in the lowest group of non-vegetarian and flesh food intakes had 50-60% increased odds of low B12 status (adjusted OR 1.62 [95% CI 0.89 to 2.96] and 1.49 [0.78 to 2.85] respectively). Micronutrient-enriched beverages were also positively associated with plasma B12 concentrations but this association did not reach statistical significance (p=0.060). Children reporting no consumption of these beverages had a 3-fold increased odds of having low B12 status (adjusted OR 2.83 [95% CI 1.31 to 6.10]). There were no associations between the consumption frequency of dairy foods, traditional fermented foods or raw vegetables and plasma B12 concentration in fully adjusted analyses. Religion was found to be an independent predictor of B12 concentration whereas residence was not associated with B12 status (data not shown).

Maternal B12 concentrations during pregnancy
Median (IQR) maternal B12 concentration was 166 (125, 224) pmol/l. Forty-two percent of mothers had levels indicating B12 deficiency (&lt;150 pmol/l). Maternal plasma B12 concentration was positively associated with B12 concentration in the children (Table 4, p&lt;0.001). A 1% increase in maternal B12 concentration was associated with a 0.22% increase in the child’s B12 concentration. There was no association between maternal B12 concentration and the children’s B12 intake (p=0.870). The association between maternal and child B12 concentrations remained after adjustment for the children’s dietary intake (Table 4, p&lt;0.001). Among children with low B12 intakes, those born to non-deficient mothers had higher B12 concentrations (median [IQR] 311 [259, 436]) than those born to mothers with the lowest B12 status (269 [217, 302]; p=0.003). The associations described above of B12 intakes, flesh and non-vegetarian foods and micronutrient-enriched beverage consumption with the children’s B12 concentrations were statistically significant after adjusting for maternal B12 status (Table 4).

DISCUSSION
Summary of main findings
We have studied the relationship of dietary vitamin B12 intakes and B12 source foods with plasma B12 concentrations in a large sample of healthy 9.5-year-old South Indian children. There are currently no standard criteria for defining B12 deficiency in children, but 2.5% were deficient according to the adult definition, and a further 14% had ‘marginal’ status. Given that rates of deficiency in India have been measured at 1-44% the prevalence in our cohort could be considered low.(10-14) However the 150pmol/L cut offs was derived for adults and may not be a valid measure of deficiency for children. The children’s B12 concentrations were positively related to dietary B12 intakes, and to consumption frequency of meat, fish and micronutrient-enriched beverages, but not dairy or fermented foods. These associations between diet and plasma concentrations were independent of maternal plasma B12 concentration during pregnancy, which was itself positively associated with B12 concentrations in the children.

Nutrient intakes
The strong positive association between plasma B12 concentration and B12 intake supports dietary B12 as a key determinant of B12 status in this population. The relationship between diet and biochemical measures was clearer when dietary B12 density, rather than absolute intakes, was examined. This is not surprising given variability in reported energy intakes which, if not fully accounted for by adjustment for age and body size, can obscure nutrient intake relationships.(41) The possibility of reverse causality (i.e. biochemical status affecting intake) seems unlikely in children; this has been suggested in the elderly, among whom B-vitamin deficiency-associated cognitive decline could have an adverse impact on diet.(20) Our data support food frequency questionnaires as suitable tools for measuring relative B12 intakes within a population, although bias towards reporting consumption of foods associated with affluence must be considered.(42) Our findings are consistent with other observational studies.(13,22,43) Estimated dietary B12 correlated with plasma B12 concentration in Guatemalan school-children.(43) B12 intake from complementary foods was recently identified as an important determinant of plasma B12 concentrations in toddlers in rural India, as well as in Guatemala.(13,22)

Food consumption
The observation that meat and fish consumption was positively related to plasma B12 concentrations suggests that these foods are important contributors to children’s B12 status. It is consistent with data from Colombian schoolchildren showing that a diet pattern that included frequent beef, chicken and dairy consumption was positively associated with plasma B12 concentration.(24) A small study of Dutch adolescents showed that frequency of consumption of animal-derived foods (dairy foods, meat, eggs and fish) explained nearly half the variance in serum B12 concentrations.(25) The dose-related association between micronutrient-enriched beverage consumption and plasma B12 in our study is highly plausible given their high B12 content (approximately 2 μg per serving). No association was seen with dairy-food consumption. Although the B12 content of the widely consumed ‘curd’ (yoghurt) is thought to be relatively low, less frequent yoghurt intake was a predictor of lower B12 status in a recent study of South Indian women.(6) It is likely that our findings reflect adherence to the lacto-vegetarian dietary pattern (characterised by frequent yoghurt consumption and a low frequency of meat consumption) previously described in our cohort.(23) Lacto-vegetarian diet pattern scores were negatively correlated with plasma B12 concentrations.(23)

We examined the relationship between frequency of consumption of raw vegetables and B12 status because of the suggestion that microbial contamination of uncooked vegetables (e.g. due to contamination by animal faeces) may be an important source of B12 in some contexts.(44) We found no convincing association between raw vegetable consumption level and B12 status. Foods made of fermented rice or lentils, such as dosa and idli, were also of interest as potential B12 sources through microbial B12 production during fermentation.(3) Our data suggest that the content and/or bioavailability of B12 from these foods is negligible.(3)

Implications of the dietary findings
It remains to be established whether sub-clinical (asymptomatic) cobalamin deficiency (SCCD) is meaningful in terms of functional and health outcomes.(45) Data linking lower B12 concentrations to greater adiposity, glucose intolerance and adult cognitive decline, and lower maternal B12 status to insulin resistance and poorer cognitive function in the children come mainly from associations in observational studies.(5,18,20,30,46) However, supplementation with physiological doses of B12 in a rural Indian population produced a marked fall in plasma homocysteine, suggesting functional benefit.(47) B12-containing supplements also improved cognitive function among elderly people with mild cognitive impairment and high homocysteine levels in the UK.(48) We did not identify foods contributing to B12 status that are suitable for India’s vegetarians. Although micronutrient-enriched beverages are apparently a rich B12 source, they are high in sugar (4-8 teaspoons/serving, with extra sugar usually added). The drinks should be promoted with caution due to the associated risk of dental caries, and, given increasing childhood obesity in India, the effect on overall energy intake.(49-51) Although a greater proportion of our cohort was underweight (24.4%), overweight or obesity was present in 4.5%. In a recent sample of 23,000 children in Mysore, overweight or obesity was found in 11.9% of children.(52) If SCCD is shown to be an important problem, other, affordable approaches will need to be found to improve vitamin B12 intakes in India, especially among vegetarians. These may include food fortification .(16)

Maternal B12 status
B12 concentrations in our children showed a strong positive association with maternal concentrations during pregnancy. B12 is actively transported across the placenta from mother to fetus; newborn B12 concentration is related to maternal status.(1,53) The importance of gestational B12 exposure in later childhood can only be studied in a birth cohort context like ours, and to the best of our knowledge B12 concentrations in children of this age in relation to maternal status during pregnancy have not previously been reported. The most obvious explanation for the correlation between maternal and children’s B12 status is that children eat the same foods as their parents. However, in our study, maternal B12 status was not related to children’s B12 intakes, and the association between maternal and children’s plasma B12 was independent of children’s dietary measures. Thus, although we did not measure maternal diet directly, our results suggest that the association was not due to similarities in the diets of mother and child. Children with low dietary intakes are likely to be at increased risk of low B12 status if they are born to mothers with low B12 status.(2) We also found that among children with low current B12 intakes, B12 concentrations were lower if their mothers had lower B12 status in pregnancy. Improving maternal status, by adding B12 to the routine pregnancy iron and folate supplements, for example, could improve long-term B12 status among children.

Strengths and limitations of the study
Our cohort is likely to differ in some key characteristics from India nationally: it is predominantly urban; there are a greater proportion of Muslim families in the cohort than the nation as a whole (35% vs 12.5%); the range of standard of living is narrower within our cohort.(54)

Assessment of nutrient intakes using a FFQ and nutrient content tables inevitably introduces imprecision. Calculated energy intakes were high for children of this age and size. Although our FFQ has not been validated in terms of energy, food patterns derived from the FFQ have shown expected associations with blood micronutrient markers.(23) Nutrient losses during cooking had to be estimated because Indian nutrient composition data was only available for raw foods. Given these limitations, the avoidance of a fully reductionist approach (i.e. only examining diet in terms of calculated nutrient intakes) was a strength. Though supplementation is not thought to be common in this cohort, we were able to avoid distortion of our results by excluding children who reported use of multivitamin supplements. Although children’s B12 intakes were comprehensively measured, a limitation may be that we did not measure maternal B12 intake. An important limitation of our study was the absence of measures of relevant biomarkers (e.g. methylmalonic acid) to triangulate with B12 concentration to assess B12 status more accurately.(55)

Final conclusions
Flesh food (meat and fish) consumption is an important determinant of plasma vitamin B12 level in this population of South Indian children. Although there may be a secular trend towards serving children meat and fish, new approaches are needed to identify and/or develop appropriate dietary B12 sources for Indians who consume these foods infrequently for economic or religious reasons. Micronutrient-enriched beverages are an important source of vitamin B12 in our cohort, but they should be promoted with care due to their high sugar content. Maternal B12 concentrations during pregnancy remain strongly associated with children’s B12 concentrations well into childhood, independent of B12 intakes at 9.5 years; improving maternal B12 status in pregnancy may improve B12 status in Indian children.
