Small and non-traditional food stores (e.g., corner stores) are often
the most accessible source of food for residents of lower income urban
neighborhoods in the U.S. Although healthy options are often limited at
these stores, little is known about customers who purchase healthy, versus
less healthy, foods/beverages in these venues.

Methods
We conducted 661 customer intercept interviews at 105 stores (corner
stores, gas marts, pharmacies, dollar stores) in Minneapolis/St. Paul,
Minnesota, assessing all food and beverage items purchased. We defined three
categories of “healthy” and four categories of
“unhealthy” purchases. Interviews assessed customer
characteristics (e.g., demographics, body-mass index [BMI]).
We examined associations between healthy vs. unhealthy purchase categories
and customer characteristics.

Results
Overall, 11% of customers purchased ≥ 1 serving of
healthy foods/beverages in one or more of the three categories: 8%
purchased fruits/vegetables, 2% whole grains, and 1%
non-/low-fat dairy. Seventy-one percent of customers purchased ≥ 1
serving of unhealthy foods/beverages in one or more of four categories:
46% purchased sugar-sweetened beverages, 17% savory snacks,
15% candy, and 13% sweet baked goods. Male (vs. female)
customers, those with a lower education levels, and those who reported
shopping at the store for convenience (vs. other reasons) were less likely
to purchase fruits/vegetables. Unhealthy purchases were more common among
customers with a BMI ≥30 kg/m2 (vs. lower BMI).

Conclusion
Results suggest intervention opportunities to increase healthy
purchases at small and non-traditional food stores, particularly
interventions aimed at male residents, those with lower education levels and
residents living close to the store.

   INTRODUCTION
Small food stores, such as corner and convenience stores, are often the most
accessible source of food for residents of urban neighborhoods in the U.S.
Low-income and high-ethnic/minority urban neighborhoods in particular tend to have a
high concentration of these small stores and have fewer larger supermarkets,
compared to higher income and primarily White neighborhoods.1–2 Several studies have shown that healthy food and beverage
options, such as fresh fruits/vegetables and healthy snacks, are limited in small
food stores.3–6 while unhealthy items like high-calorie
snacks, candy and sugar-sweetened beverages (SSBs) are quite common.3, 7

Managers of small food stores report low customer demand for healthy items
compared with less healthy options.8–10 Indeed,
findings from studies of the nutritional quality of purchases support the notion
that low-nutrient, energy dense purchases are the most common in small food stores.
For example, a study in Philadelphia demonstrated that SSBs, chips, prepared food
items, and pastries were the most common purchases at corner stores.11 Similarly, a study in Baltimore
found that corner store shoppers were much more likely than supermarket shoppers to
buy soda, potato chips, and unhealthy foods overall.12 Furthermore, two studies of bodega shoppers
in New York City showed that the most commonly purchased products were SSBs, while
produce purchases were uncommon.13–14

Despite limited healthy options at corner stores and customers often buying
unhealthy items in these venues, these stores often do stock some food and beverages
of high nutritional quality. One study showed that half of urban food stores stocked
at least one variety of fresh fruit or vegetables.6 An assessment of SNAP (Supplemental Nutrition
Assistance Program)-authorized small- to mid-sized stores found that more than half
carried one or more varieties of fat-free or low-fat milk, fresh or canned fruit and
whole-grain rich bread.15 Given
that store owners make stocking decisions in part based on customer
demands,5, 8–9,
10 it is important to
understand more about the shoppers who choose to purchase healthier items (versus
less healthy items) at small urban food stores. Studies examining characteristics of
shoppers at small food stores are somewhat limited and provide little information on
the sociodemographic or other characteristics of these customers, such as their
reasons for and frequency for shopping at the store, and how these characteristics
may be associated with types of products purchased.11–13 Discerning purchasing patterns among different customer groups
may help retailers improve promotions of healthier options, and on a broader level,
assist public health practitioners in designing interventions to prompt shoppers to
make healthier choices.

In the current study, we conducted customer intercept interviews at small and
nontraditional food stores in a metropolitan area to assess the characteristics of
shoppers based on their types of purchases, specifically healthy vs. less healthy
options.

METHODS
These data were collected as part of a larger study, STORE (STaple Foods
ORdinance Evaluation), which is a large-scale evaluation of a local Staple Foods
Ordinance, passed by the Minneapolis City Council in 2008 and revised in 2014.
Briefly, the ordinance requires licensed grocery stores to stock minimum quantities
and varieties of products in 10 categories of staple foods (e.g., fruits and
vegetables, whole grains, low-fat dairy) and beverages. Data for analysis for the
current study were collected between July and November 2014 before the policy went
into effect. The Institutional Review Board of the University of Minnesota approved
this study.

Store Sample
We randomly selected food stores from lists of licensed grocery
retailers for two cities, Minneapolis and St. Paul, Minnesota. The Minneapolis
list was obtained from the Minneapolis Health Department and the St. Paul list
was obtained from the Minnesota Department of Agriculture. Prior to the random
selection of stores, those exempt from the Minneapolis policy, as well as
comparable stores in St. Paul, were excluded from our sample, including: (1)
stores in the core downtown commercial districts, (2) small stores not expected
to stock an array of staple foods (e.g., liquor stores, specialty shops, and
other small vendors such as produce stands), and (3) stores with invalid
addresses. Because our evaluation was limited to stores most likely to be
affected by the policy, we excluded supermarkets and stores listed in the
statewide database as authorized retailers in the Women, Infants, and Children
(WIC) program, since compliance with WIC standards would result in these stores
already meeting the new policy standards. Of the 255 eligible stores, we
randomly selected 180 for study participation. Among these 180 stores, 20 were
deemed ineligible upon visiting the store (e.g., new participation in WIC), and
for an additional 32 stores we could not obtain active consent for the study.
Data collectors attempted recruitment at the remaining 128 stores.

Customer Intercept Interviews
Data collectors worked in pairs to conduct customer intercept
interviews. Teams attempted to recruit customers for 30 minutes with a goal of
recruiting a minimum of five interviews per store.16 In 22 stores, no customer was
successfully recruited. To be eligible for participation, customers had to speak
and understand English, be at least 18 years of age, and must have purchased a
food and/or beverage. Each customer was required to provide verbal informed
consent in order to participate. Data collectors recorded all food and beverages
purchased including the product name, size, quantity and the price paid. Data
collectors then administered a short survey that included demographic questions
(age, sex, race/ethnicity, education, employment), customer-reported height and
weight, and frequency of and reasons for shopping at the store. One general
retailer was excluded from the analysis because it could not be included in
models accounting for store type. In total, we completed 661 interviews in 105
stores (corner stores, gas marts, pharmacies, dollar stores) across the two
cities.

Measures
Our main measures of interest for the current study pertained to healthy
and unhealthy food and beverage purchases. We created measures for healthy
food/beverage purchases based on three categories: fruits/vegetables, whole
grains, and non-/low-fat dairy. Each was a dichotomous variable (1=one
or more servings; 0=less than one serving). Fruits and vegetables
included all types of fruit except fruit juices and all types of vegetables
except fried potatoes and vegetable based savory snacks (e.g., potato chips).
Whole grains included wholegrain-rich versions of all grains, flours, dry mixes,
bread, rolls, crackers, pasta and cereal. Non-/low-fat dairy included low-fat
(1%) and fat-free milk and cheese, and low- and fat-free yogurt. A
summary measure of healthy food purchasing was also created, which was the sum
of the healthy food categories for which at least one serving was purchased
(range in possible values 0–3).

We created similar dichotomous measures for unhealthy food/beverage
purchases based on four categories: SSBs, sweet baked goods, candy, and savory
snacks. SSBs included sweetened beverages such soft drinks, fruit drinks and
ready-to-drink flavored milk. Sweet baked goods included foods such as cakes,
cookies, and pastries. Candy included chocolate and non-chocolate candy. Savory
snacks included snack chips, popcorn, and vegetable-based savory snacks. A
summary measure for unhealthy food/beverage purchasing was created by summing
the number of unhealthy food/beverage categories for which at least one serving
was purchased (range in possible values 0–4).

In the customer interview data, demographic measures consisted of age,
gender, race/ethnicity, education level and employment status. Age was a
continuous measure from which we created a three-level variable based on the
frequency distribution (18–24, 25–44, and ≥45). The
three gender response options (i.e., male, female, other) were dichotomized to
male vs. female (“other” responses [n=2]
were set to missing). The race/ethnicity interview item included seven check all
that apply options: White, Native American, Black, Asian, Pacific Islander,
Hispanic and Other that we recoded (based on frequency distributions) to White
non-Hispanic, Black non-Hispanic and Other. Education level was measured as
three categories: high school diploma or less, some college, and
bachelor’s degree or higher. Employment status was a three-level
variable: employed, unemployed/disability, or other (student, retired).

BMI was a continuous measure calculated from the participants’
self-reported weight and height responses (kg/m2). From this measure
we created a three-level variable corresponding to underweight/healthy,
overweight and obese cut points17 (16–24.9, 25–29.9, and ≥30
kg/m2). The interview item assessing customers’ shopping
frequency at the store included eight response options ranging from more than
once a day to less than once a month, which we collapsed into three categories
(at least once a day, 1–6 times a week, and less than once a week). The
participant’s most important reason for shopping at the store originally
included ten response options (e.g., close to home, close to work, good prices),
which we dichotomized into “close to destination” (i.e., close
to home, work or other location) vs. “other” for analysis.

Two additional measures, store type and Healthy Food Supply (HFS) score,
were obtained from separate visits to the stores by study staff. We used a tool
modified from the Yale Rudd Center18 to collect data on the availability, price, and quality
(for fresh fruits and vegetables) of 69 food and beverage items. The Rudd Center
tool focuses on WIC-approved items, but in the current evaluation, the
instrument was adapted to align with Minneapolis Staple Food Ordinance
requirements and other store features of interest5. Data collectors indicated the type of
store as either a corner/small grocery store, food/gas-mart, pharmacy, or dollar
store. HFS score, a measure that summarizes availability, price, quality, and
variety of inventory, was calculated for each store based on data collected on
food and beverage purchases. The HFS score can range from 0 to 31 with a higher
score indicating greater availability of healthy food. HFS score has previously
been used to evaluate overall healthfulness in both WIC and non-WIC
stores.18

Analysis
We first computed descriptive statistics for all measures. We then
assessed bivariate associations between each healthy and unhealthy food category
(outcome measures) and customer demographics, BMI, and frequency of/reason for
shopping at store (independent measures) using Chi-square tests (p &lt;
.05). For each outcome measure, we estimated a multivariate multilevel logistic
regression model that included all independent measures that were significant in
bivariate analyses. In each regression model we included store type and HFS
score as fixed effects to account for variation in stocking patterns across
stores, and store identification as a random effect to account for customers
nested within stores. All analyses were conducted using SAS/STAT Version 9.4
(SAS Institute Inc., Cary, NC).

RESULTS
Descriptive statistics are presented in Table 1. Overall, 11% of customers purchased one or more
servings of healthy foods and/or beverages in one or more of the three categories,
including 8% purchasing fruits/vegetables, 2% purchasing whole
grains and 1% purchasing non-/low-fat dairy. Among the unhealthy categories,
71% of participants purchased at least one serving of unhealthy
foods/beverages overall (46% purchased SSBs, 13% sweet baked goods,
15% candy, and 17% savory snacks). Nearly half of the customers were
ages 25–44, 57% were male, and 47% were non-Hispanic White.
About one quarter of our sample reported having a four-year college degree and
63% were employed. Approximately one-third were in each BMI category. Most
customers (71%) shopped at the store at least weekly, among whom 27%
shopped there daily, and 75% reported that the primary reason for shopping
at the store was that it was close to a destination. The most common type of store
in our sample was food/gas marts, with the least common being dollar stores. The
mean HFS score was 10.5.

Bivariate analyses for healthy purchases (Table 2) demonstrated that female customers were more likely to purchase
fruits/vegetables, and those with a bachelor’s degree or higher were more
likely than those with less education to purchase fruit/vegetables and healthy
food/beverages overall. Those who reported shopping at the store because it was
close to a destination were less likely to buy healthy food/beverages, compared to
those who gave another reason for shopping at the store. All independent variables
that were significant in bivariate models were also significant in multivariate
analysis for at least one outcome. Females had over two times higher odds than males
of buying fruits/vegetable. Customers with a bachelor’s degree or higher had
3.2 higher odds than those with a high school diploma or less of purchasing
fruits/vegetables and 2.2 higher odds of purchasing healthy food/beverages overall.
Customers who reported shopping at the store because it was close to their
destination were less likely to buy fruits/vegetables, compared to those who gave
another reason for shopping at the store.

Bivariate analyses for unhealthy purchases (Table 3) demonstrated that both younger and unemployed customers were
more likely to buy SSBs, compared to their older and/or employed counterparts.
Non-Hispanic Black customers and those with less education were also more likely to
buy SSBs and unhealthy food/beverages overall. Those who shopped at the store daily,
versus less frequently, were more likely to purchase candy but less likely to
purchase SSBs and savory snacks. Savory snacks, SSBs and unhealthy purchases overall
were more common among customers with a BMI ≥30 kg/m2 (vs. lower
BMI). Multivariate analysis showed that customers aged 44 and younger and those
unemployed had approximately two times greater odds than older and employed
customers respectively of purchasing SSBs. Non-Hispanic Black shoppers had higher
odds of purchasing savory snacks and unhealthy foods overall compared to
non-Hispanic White shoppers. Customers with a BMI ≤24.9 kg/m2
(compared to those with a BMI ≥30 kg/m2) had lower odds of
purchasing SSBs, savory snacks, and unhealthy foods overall.

DISCUSSION
This study is one of the first assessments of characteristics of shoppers at
urban small food stores based on the healthfulness of their purchases. Consistent
with other studies, healthier purchases were relatively uncommon.11,13–14, 19 This was perhaps not unexpected
given the tendency of small food stores to stock limited healthy products.3–6, 15 Overall,
11% of customers purchased at least one serving of healthy foods and/or
beverages (defined as fruits/vegetables, whole grains and non-/low-fat dairy).

Food purchases are likely an important reflection of overall diet quality
among adults. A recent study by Appelhans et al.20 showed that the nutritional quality of objectively measured
food purchases was highly correlated with overall dietary quality; correlations for
whole fruit and vegetables had among the highest concordance between purchases and
consumption. One key finding in the current study was that those with higher
education levels were more likely to purchase healthy products. Shoppers with a
college degree were more likely to buy fruits/vegetables and healthy foods overall
compared to those with less education. Given the correlation between purchasing and
consumption, results are consistent with national trends demonstrating that adults
with low education are less likely to meet dietary guidelines than adults with high
education.21 Although
small food stores can improve their stocking and promotion of healthier foods for
all potential customers, making sure promotions include communities who tend to have
lower education levels may be especially prudent, for example ensuring adequate
outreach to local residents in lower-SES communities, as well as providing
promotional materials in appropriate languages and culturally relevant products.
Other intervention approaches could focus on mobilizing local residents to advocate
for healthier options in these stores. Such efforts could include higher SES
customers who may already regularly purchase healthy products, but who would like to
see an expansion of nutritious offerings in these stores (that would subsequently
benefit all customers).

Our results showed that female customers also had a higher likelihood of
purchasing fruits and/or vegetables, as did those whose primary reason for shopping
at the store was something other than close proximity to their destination. Perhaps
women are more likely than men to shop for their families and may prioritize
bringing healthy food into the home.22–23 Taken
together with the finding that convenient location is less a determining factor for
shopping, perhaps women travel to these store as destinations in themselves and are
using the stores as to buy healthy/staple foods, similar to a regular grocery store,
rather than snacks. On the other hand, the finding that women are more likely than
men to buy fruits and vegetables could be a manifestation of national data trends
that suggest that women tend to have heathier diets than men.21 More research is needed to better understand
these purchasing patterns. Nevertheless, promotion of healthy foods/beverages geared
toward those living/working in proximity to the stores may be beneficial.

As expected, we found that unhealthy, rather than healthy, purchases were
much more common among participants. Similar to other studies,11–12,14 we found that
nearly three-quarters of purchases included at least one serving of an unhealthy
food and/or beverage, with nearly half including SSBs. Shoppers with higher BMIs
(compared to those with lower BMIs) were more likely to purchase unhealthy items,
including SSBs, savory snacks and unhealthy items overall. Increased stocking and
promotion of healthier food and beverage choices in small stores may be especially
beneficial for overweight persons. All shoppers, but particularly those who are
overweight, could also potentially benefit from simultaneous reductions in the
stocking of, and promotions for, unhealthy food and beverages.

Younger shoppers, particularly those 18–24, were more likely than
older customers to buy SSBs, which is consistent with other recent research in fast
food chains.24 Over half of the
younger customers purchased an SSB, which is concerning given the high obesity rates
among young people in the U.S.25
SSBs have been shown to be a contributing factor in the obesity epidemic.26 Various public efforts are
underway to address the prevalence, promotion, and low prices of SSBs.e.g.,
27 Our results demonstrate
these efforts, such as providing caloric information of SSBs via posted
signs28–29 and giving prominent placement to healthy
products—rather than only unhealthy products—in stores30 clearly need to be targeted to
small urban food stores as well as other retail settings.

Despite the important insights our results provide, several limitations
should be considered. Generalizability is limited because we conducted our study in
only one metropolitan area. Additionally, in this study we provide cross-sectional
results, thereby preventing any causal inferences. There are also various ways to
define healthy and unhealthy foods and beverages and the definitions we chose may
not include all healthy or less healthy options. Nevertheless, given the consistency
of our main results with those of other studies, it is doubtful that
recategorization of healthy and healthy foods would substantially alter the finding
that healthy purchases are much less frequent than less healthy ones. Finally, the
low prevalence of purchasing in some of the healthy food/beverage categories
prevented us in certain cases from computing multivariate models and may have
created low power for detecting significant effects in bivariate and multivariate
analyses.

Despite its limitations, our study presents a novel look at the
characterization of shoppers at urban small food stores based on their types of
purchases. Specific results point to potential public health interventions to
improve access to healthy food and beverage options in urban areas. Promotions aimed
at residents living close to the store and those from lower SES populations, such as
incentive programs now being developed and piloted within SNAP (Supplemental
Nutrition Assistance Program; https://nifa.usda.gov/program/food-insecurity-nutrition-incentive-fini-grant-program),
may be particularly beneficial. In addition, interventions that successfully improve
healthy offerings in stores will likely benefit all customers. Future research needs
include longitudinal studies and studies in other geographic locations to verify and
expand our results. Future research should also examine the role of promotions and
impulse buys in encouraging healthier purchases, particularly when items are
marketed to specific groups. Better understanding of shopping decisions can support
store managers in marketing and merchandising healthier items to build consumer
demand.
