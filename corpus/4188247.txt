iet has been recognized for many years
(1&#x2013;3). Dietary guidelines note that the high nutrient density of breakfast
cereals (especially those that are whole grain or high in cereal fiber) makes them an
important source of key nutrients (4). In
addition to providing an important source of vitamins and minerals, breakfast cereals
are also potentially important sources of antioxidants (5&#x2013;7) and phytoestrogens (8) and are 1 of the most important sources of whole
grains (9). However, there have been no
comprehensive reviews of their health benefits and there is some uncertainty about their
nutritional merits because of concerns about the amounts of salt, sugar, or saturated
fat in some products (10).
      The Australian Breakfast Cereal Manufacturers Forum commissioned this systematic review
to summarize the evidence relating the consumption of breakfast cereals and a range of
health outcomes. The review covers the breakfast cereal category generally and not
individual products or cereal components or properties such as whole grains, dietary
fiber, or glycemic index (GI)5.

      Methods
      For this review, &#x201C;breakfast cereal&#x201D; was defined to include ready-to-eat
breakfast cereal (RTEC), oats/porridge, and muesli. Exclusions were breakfast bars,
muesli bars, liquid breakfast products, milk drinks, and yogurt products. The author
conducted a systematic review of the published scientific literature from all dates
until October 2013 in the Scopus and Medline databases by using the search terms listed
in Supplemental Table 1. Inclusion criteria were as follows:
English-language publications only, studies in adult and children and males and females
of all ages and health conditions, and all study types including reviews. Exclusion
criteria were as follows: animal studies or articles primarily focused on the breakfast
meal, dietary fiber, whole grains, cereal fiber, or other components of cereal foods in
general. Relevant studies cited in review articles or those identified in the search
were also considered. Figure 1 shows
the study selection flowchart. From the 5316 articles originally identified in the
database search, a total of 232 were used in the qualitative synthesis presented in the
Results section.

      Quantitative data were extracted from the relevant articles, including the study
methods, populations, and outcomes of significance to the review. Study quality was
examined by using the methods of the American Dietetic Association Evidence Analysis
Manual, and scored as positive, neutral, or negative (11).
      Body of evidence tables were developed to present the main findings with the use of the
methodology and format recommended by the Australian National Health and Medical
Research Council (12, 13). These statements summarize the scientific findings in a
standardized manner, with a grading from A (body of evidence can be trusted to guide
practice), B (can be trusted to guide practice in most situations), C (provides some
support but care should be taken in its application), to D (body of evidence is weak and
must be applied with caution) (14).

        Contribution of breakfast cereals to healthy diets

          Contribution to energy and nutrient intakes.

            Reviews.
            There have been 3 major reviews of the contributions of breakfast cereals to
nutrient intake and overall good health: 2 general narrative reviews (15, 16) and 1 systematic review of studies in children and adolescents
(17). One other review of the
breakfast meal also summarized some of the studies that reported the effects of
RTEC consumption (18).
            These reviews are largely in agreement that, compared with those who consume
lower amounts of breakfast cereal or nonconsumers, regular breakfast cereal
consumers have

                &#x2022; higher intakes of carbohydrate;

                &#x2022; higher intakes of total sugars;

                &#x2022; lower intakes of fat;

                &#x2022; lower cholesterol intakes;

                &#x2022; enhanced micronutrient intakes;

                &#x2022; higher milk intakes;

                &#x2022; greater likelihood of meeting micronutrient recommended
intakes;

                &#x2022; improved nutritional status; and

                &#x2022; lower serum cholesterol concentrations.

            Intervention studies.
            Table 1 summarizes
findings from 11 intervention studies that incorporated additional breakfast
cereal into subjects&#x2019; diets and shows the nutrients that were increased,
decreased, or remained unchanged in the subjects&#x2019; total daily intakes.
Those studies generally show an increase in vitamin and mineral intakes, and
decreases in fat, but no consistent effect on daily energy, protein, or
carbohydrate intakes.

                  Study included in 1 of the review articles.

            Cross-sectional studies.
            There are 51 studies that reported on the nutritional impact of regular
breakfast cereal consumption in those who eat breakfast: that is, comparing
consumption of a breakfast cereal&#x2013;based breakfast vs. other breakfast
types (see Supplemental Tables 2 and 3). Of these
studies, 30 were in children (19&#x2013;48) and 21 were
in adults (31, 49&#x2013;68).
The results from the cross-sectional studies and the randomized controlled
trials (RCTs) showed very consistent results.
            Children and adolescents who consume breakfast cereals regularly have daily
diets that are

                &#x2022; higher in percentage of energy (%E) from carbohydrate, total
sugars, dietary fiber, vitamins A and D, thiamin, riboflavin, niacin,
pyridoxine, folate, calcium, iron, magnesium, and zinc;

                &#x2022; no different in total energy intake, %E from protein, or sodium;
and

                &#x2022; lower in %E from fat.

            Almost all of the studies are for RTEC only. Many of the micronutrient
differences are related to the fortification profile of the breakfast cereals,
but the increased milk intake would contribute significantly to the higher
daily calcium and riboflavin intakes. In both Australia and the United States,
approximately one-quarter of all milk consumed by children and adolescents is
added to breakfast cereal (69, 70).
            Other findings from the studies show that children and adolescents who eat
breakfast cereal regularly

                &#x2022; are less likely to have vitamin and mineral intakes below the
recommended daily requirements, especially for calcium (21, 22, 24,
25, 27, 33,
37, 38, 41,
44, 46, 48);

                &#x2022; have better diets overall, measured by the Healthy Eating Index
score (48);

                &#x2022; have lower daily cholesterol intakes (20); and

                &#x2022; have better nutritional status (assessed by blood measures),
especially for the vitamins thiamin, riboflavin, and pyridoxine (32) and iron (34).

            In food-insecure children in the United States, the percentage whose daily
nutrient intake was below the Estimated Average Requirement was higher in those
who did not consume breakfast cereal for several key nutrient, including 62.7%
vs. 39.9% for calcium, 26.3% vs. 19.4% for magnesium, 33.4% vs 8.1% for vitamin
A, 15.4% vs. 3.2% for zinc, and 9.4% vs. 0.1% for folate, respectively (48). The difference in total milk
consumption (345 vs. 142 g for cereal consumers vs. nonconsumers) was
significantly greater than the difference in food-secure children (324 vs.
161g; P &lt; 0.05)&#x2014;that is, RTEC was even more
important in food-insecure children in improving milk intakes. Comparing
Healthy Eating Index scores, both food-secure and food-insecure children
achieved better scores when they consumed breakfast cereals, but the
improvement in total grain intake was significantly greater for food-insecure
children (46).
            In the 1995 Australian National Nutrition Survey, breakfast cereals as consumed
with milk and sugar contributed only 6&#x2013;9% of total energy intakes of
children and adolescents but provided &gt;25% of the Recommended Dietary
Intake (RDI) for thiamin, riboflavin, and iron (for boys) and &gt;10% of
the RDI for niacin, folate (for boys), calcium, iron (for girls), and magnesium
(37). In the 2007 Australian
National Children&#x2019;s Nutrition and Activity Survey, RTEC consumption
provided 10% of total daily fiber intake (47).
            Adults who consume breakfast cereals regularly have daily diets that are

                &#x2022; higher in %E from carbohydrate, total sugars, dietary fiber,
vitamins A and D, thiamin, riboflavin, niacin, pyridoxine, folate,
calcium, iron, magnesium, and zinc;

                &#x2022; no different in total energy intake, sodium, or %E from protein;
and

                &#x2022; lower in %E from fat.

            The latest national survey from the United Kingdom found that whereas breakfast
cereals contribute 3&#x2013;5% of the daily energy intake and 2&#x2013;5% of
dietary fiber intake, they provide only 1% of fat and 1&#x2013;2% of sodium in
the total diet (3). Similarly,
breakfast cereals contribute only 2.1&#x2013;2.6% of total sodium intake in
adults in the United States (71) and
&lt;2.5% in Australia (72).
            Other findings show that adults who eat breakfast cereal regularly

                &#x2022; are less likely to have vitamin and mineral intakes below the
recommended daily requirements, especially for thiamin, riboflavin,
niacin, folate, vitamin C, calcium, magnesium, iron, zinc, and fiber
(54, 56, 57,
60&#x2013;63, 66&#x2013;68);

                &#x2022; have better diets overall, measured by the Healthy Eating Index
(63); and

                &#x2022; have better nutritional status (assessed by blood measures),
especially for the vitamins thiamin, riboflavin, and folate (31, 60, 73,
74).

            Those consuming whole-grain and high-fiber breakfast cereals, compared with
those consuming other breakfast cereals, had significantly higher daily intakes
of %E from protein, fiber, niacin, folate, calcium, and zinc (65); however, whole-grain cereal intake
in particular is likely to be a marker of a healthy lifestyle and therefore
potentially subject to residual confounding.

          Benefits of a breakfast cereal meal pattern.
          There are clearly nutritional benefits from including breakfast cereals in a
breakfast meal. A recently proposed Breakfast Quality Index has the inclusion of
breakfast cereals as a key factor to improve the overall breakfast meal score
(75). Findings from the
cross-sectional studies show that

              &#x2022; eating breakfast cereal facilitates greater milk consumption in
children (39, 48, 76) and
in adults (51, 54, 56, 62, 63, 65, 77);

              &#x2022; those who eat breakfast cereal regularly have higher whole-grain
consumption per day, both in children (42, 46, 48, 78) and in adults (63,
79); and

              &#x2022; children and adults eating RTEC also eat a greater range of
different foods at the breakfast meal (28, 63).

          Comparison of breakfast cereal eaters with breakfast skippers.
          Eleven cross-sectional studies (summarized in Supplemental Table 4)
compared the daily nutrient intakes of people eating a cereal-based breakfast with
breakfast skippers (20, 41, 44, 46, 50, 53, 54, 60, 63, 64, 67). Those
results mostly supported the comparisons of consumers of breakfasts with or
without the inclusion of breakfast cereals. Consistently, the daily diets of
breakfast cereal eaters (compared with breakfast skippers) are

              &#x2022; higher in energy and %E from carbohydrate, dietary fiber, and all
vitamins and minerals, and

              &#x2022; lower in %E from fat.

          The results from comparisons of %E from protein, total sugars, and sodium are more
varied and there are no clear trends. The consistent finding of higher milk
intakes in those who consume breakfast cereals is part of the reason that studies
have shown higher riboflavin status in those who consume breakfast cereals (80).

          Presweetened vs. minimally presweetened cereals.
          Analysis of data from the 2007 Australian National Children&#x2019;s Survey of
children and adolescents aged 2&#x2013;16 y compared the intakes of those
consuming presweetened breakfast cereals with &#x2265;15% total sugars or
minimally presweetened (PS) breakfast cereals (non-PS) (81) and found that total daily energy and nutrient intakes
were not significantly different, including intake of total sugars (PS vs. non-PS
consumers: 121 vs. 118 g/d). Another analysis of the same survey data noted that
RTECs provided 34% of the total sugars consumed at breakfast but only 7% of the
total sugars consumed over the whole day (44).
          A recent study of 312 Australian breakfast cereals showed that there was no
relation between the total sugar content and the energy density of breakfast
cereals, both ready-to-eat and other breakfast types (82), which supports the finding of no difference in total
daily energy intake regardless of the amount of sugar in breakfast cereals
themselves.
          These results are consistent with several studies in American children. A study in
5- to 12-y-old children found that that compared with children consuming RTEC with
&gt;25% total sugars, those consuming nonsweetened cereals (&lt;25% total
sugars) had higher daily intakes of protein, carbohydrate, fiber, folate, vitamin
A, calcium, and magnesium, but there were no significant differences in intakes of
total energy, fat, total sugars, thiamin, riboflavin, niacin, ascorbic acid, iron,
zinc, or sodium (19). Another
cross-sectional study in U.S. children and adolescents reported that children aged
6&#x2013;11 y who consumed PS breakfast cereals had higher total added sugars in
their diet (93 vs. 83 g/d), but that in adolescents aged 12&#x2013;17 y there was
no difference in daily total sugar consumption between consumers and nonconsumers
of PS breakfast cereals (76).
          In a more recent study in PS vs. non-PS breakfast cereal consumers aged
4&#x2013;13 y, daily energy and total sugar intakes were higher in those consuming
PS cereals (defined as those with &gt;6 g total sugars per serving), but there
were no differences found for adolescents aged 14&#x2013;18 y. Daily sodium
intakes were lower in those consuming PS cereals at all ages. There were no
differences in BMI or waist circumference between any age group (43).
          In 1 experimental study (83), children
aged 5&#x2013;12 y were offered a choice of 1 of 3 high-sugar breakfast cereals
(with 11&#x2013;12 g of total sugars per serving) or low-sugar cereals (1&#x2013;4
g total sugars per serving) plus free access to added sugar, milk, fruit, and
juice. The study found that

              &#x2022; children reported greater liking of the high-sugar cereals and
consumed almost twice the amount per eating occasion compared with those
served the low-sugar cereals (61.3 vs. 34.6 g);

              &#x2022; children offered low-sugar cereals added more table sugar than
those eating high-sugar cereals, and the total sugar content (from cereal
and added sugar) was almost twice as high as with the high-sugar cereals
(24.4 vs. 12.5 g; P &lt; 0.001);

              &#x2022; there was no difference in the amount of milk consumed with the 2
types of cereals, nor the total energy consumed at the breakfast meal;
and

              &#x2022; children in the low-sugar group were more likely to put fresh fruit
on their breakfast cereal compared with the high-sugar cereal condition (54%
vs. 8%; P = 0.05).

          Table 2 provides body of
evidence summaries of the main findings from the studies on the contribution of
breakfast cereals to dietary intake.

        Weight gain, overweight, and obesity

          Meta-analysis.
          There has been only 1 meta-analysis of the evidence of the effect of breakfast
cereal consumption on obesity (84). It
examined 14 studies in 33,205 children and adolescents and calculated that,
compared with low or nonconsumers of cereal, high consumers had a lower mean BMI
by 1.13 kg/m2 (95% CI: 0.81, 1.46; P &lt; 0.0001).
Most of the studies were cross-sectional in design; only 1 intervention trial and
2 prospective studies were included. Breakfast cereal manufacturers funded all but
1 of the studies.
          The studies in this meta-analysis did not always control for physical activity or
dieting behavior, and these could be important confounding factors in the results.
The article concludes: &#x201C;Overall the evidence reviewed is suggestive that
regular consumption of breakfast cereals results in a lower BMI and a reduced
likelihood of being overweight in children and adolescents. However, more evidence
from long-term trials and investigations into mechanisms is needed to eliminate
possible confounding factors and determine causality.&#x201D;

          Systematic reviews.
          Three other systematic reviews of the topic have been published (Table 3). There is a
significant overlap between the studies included in these reviews and the
meta-analysis; the total numbers of publications included in all 4 articles are as
follows: 8 intervention studies (40,
85&#x2013;91), 6 prospective studies (36, 40, 92&#x2013;95), and 15 cross-sectional studies (24, 27, 32, 33, 35, 38, 41, 42, 55, 59, 96&#x2013;100).

(11): positive, neutral,

          The only study that examined breakfast cereal consumption and prospective weight
change was that of Bazzano et al. (93).
They reported that mean body weight gain over 13 y follow-up of 17,881 U.S. male
physicians was significantly less in those who consumed at least 1 serving of
breakfast cereal per day compared with those rarely consuming cereals: 1.18 vs.
2.27 kg (P = 0.007). The RR of becoming overweight (BMI
&#x2265;25 kg/m2) over the same period was 0.88 (95% CI: 0.67, 0.91;
P = 0.01) in regular consumers compared with those
rarely consuming cereals.
          The 3 reviews suggest that people who eat breakfast cereals regularly have a lower
BMI and are less likely to be overweight. However, results from intervention
trials are inconsistent and there is limited evidence for any proposed causal
mechanism. Furthermore, although the reported benefits from RTEC might be more
pronounced among the higher-fiber cereals, there is a need for more large-scale
randomized clinical trials.

          Additional intervention studies.
          Sixteen intervention studies exist in addition to those in the meta-analysis or
the 3 reviews and are summarized in Table
4. Most of these studies are short-term and focus only on
immediate effects on satiety and next-meal food consumption, and so do not provide
strong evidence for claims about longer-term health effects. Of the 3 longer
studies (&gt;6 wk), 2 included cereals in hypocaloric diets and found no
significant effect (101, 102). One study with 2 servings of oats in
an otherwise free diet does provide evidence to support the benefit of oat-based
cereals (103). However, that study did
not provide information on the control cereal used for comparison and required 2
servings/d to be consumed (103). The
other three 6-wk studies had differing results: 1 reported a beneficial effect
with an oat-based breakfast cereal taken at 2 meals in a day (104); another also found that increased
breakfast cereal consumption assisted weight loss in a hypocaloric diet (105); and another found no effect when
evening snacks were replaced by RTEC (106).

          Several of the intervention studies showed breakfast cereal consumption to be
helpful in assisting weight loss when used as snack or meal replacements (87&#x2013;89, 102&#x2013;104, 107), although 1 study did not find any significant effect (106).
          In contrast, most of the intervention studies that added cereal at breakfast did
not show any significant impact on measures of weight (85, 86, 90, 91, 101, 102, 106). It is often difficult to distinguish the effect of a breakfast
meal from the effect of breakfast cereals specifically; there is thus a need for
larger long-term intervention trials comparing the impact of different types of
breakfast cereals when consumed at breakfast.

          Additional cross-sectional studies.
          Sixteen additional cross-sectional studies were identified that were not included
in the 4 systematic reviews (see Supplemental Table 5) (41&#x2013;43, 45, 46, 66, 68, 81, 108&#x2013;115). Three of these studies compared the
weight status of consumers of PS or non-PS RTECs and found no differences in BMI
or waist circumference in children and adolescents (43, 81, 112). This is valuable suggestive
information, but results from cohort studies would be ideal to support a firm
statement on this issue.
          Perhaps the best evidence for a preventive effect of breakfast cereal on weight
gain comes from the single-cohort study that has examined this (116), and the computed ORs from
cross-sectional studies in the meta-analysis support those results (117). However, in the absence of further
cohort and intervention trials, the current evidence is not yet strong enough to
claim a direct protective effect.
          The summaries in Table 5
reflect the current evidence in the literature. There is insufficient evidence to
describe the best types of breakfast cereals, although there are suggestions of a
greater protective effect of higher fiber and oat cereals in some (but not all) of
the studies.

        Diabetes, glucose intolerance, and metabolic syndrome

          Meta-analysis.
          There has been 1 meta-analysis of the evidence of the effect of whole-grain
breakfast cereal consumption on diabetes (118). That study examined 16 cohort studies looking at whole and
refined grains in general, but only 3 studies (with follow-ups ranging from 6 to
19 y) had subanalyses on breakfast cereals specifically, all conducted in the
United States (119&#x2013;121). The RR of incident type 2 diabetes
(T2D) comparing the highest vs. the lowest consumption of whole-grain breakfast
cereal was 0.72 (95% CI: 0.55, 0.93; P = 0.01). For each
additional serving of whole-grain breakfast cereal, the RR was 0.73 (95% CI: 0.59,
0.91; P = 0.006). The authors noted the relatively small
number of studies and did not report any results on refined-grain breakfast
cereals separately, although their overall conclusion was that refined grains in
general are not associated with a reduced risk of T2D.
          The largest prospective study in this meta-analysis examined the association of
breakfast cereal consumption and the risk of development of T2D among 21,152 male
participants in the U.S. Physicians&#x2019; Health Study I (120). Weekly cereal consumption in 4 categories (none,
&#x2264;1/wk, 2&#x2013;6 times/wk, and &#x2265;7/wk) was estimated by using an FFQ
and breakfast cereals were categorized as whole grain or refined grain by using
the method of Jacobs et al. (122).
Incident T2D over 19 y of follow-up was ascertained by annual follow-up
questionnaires.
          When adjusted for age, cigarette smoking, BMI, physical activity, and vegetable
and alcohol intake, the HR for T2D in the highest category of consumption compared
with the lowest was 0.69 (95% CI: 0.60, 0.79; P-trend &lt;
0.0001). There was evidence for a stronger protective effect of whole-grain
breakfast cereals compared with refined-grain cereals at &#x2265;7 servings/wk: an
HR of 0.60 (95% CI: 0.50, 0.71) for whole-grain cereals vs. an HR of 0.95 (95% CI:
0.73, 1.3) for refined-grain cereals. However, both were associated with
significant risk reductions at 2&#x2013;6 servings/wk (whole-grain HR: 0.76; 95%
CI: 0.66, 0.87; refined-grain HR: 0.69; 95% CI: 0.53, 0.90). The authors
speculated that the effect might be due to the fiber content attenuating glycemic
responses or that diverse micronutrients such as magnesium, vitamin E,
antioxidants, or phytoestrogens may be responsible for the beneficial effects.
They conclude: &#x201C;These results suggest that intake of breakfast cereals
might confer a lower risk of DM [type 2 diabetes].&#x201D;
          It should be noted that the population in this study consisted of highly educated
male physicians who are likely to have more generally healthy behaviors than the
general population, so further studies in other populations are required to
confirm the findings.

          Cohort studies.
          There are 2 other cohort studies (not included in the meta-analysis) that reported
on breakfast cereals. The Melbourne Collaborative Cohort Study (123) recruited 41,258 people aged
27&#x2013;75 y at baseline and examined self-reported diabetes incidence after 4 y
of follow-up. There was no significant relation between total breakfast cereal
consumption, with an adjusted OR for incident diabetes of 1.01 (95% CI: 0.75,
1.35; P = 0.6). This study did not analyze separately for
whole-grain and refined-grain cereals but did report no significant trend with
cereal fiber consumption (OR: 1.08; 95% CI: 0.88, 1.32; P
= 0.46 for each additional 10 g/d).
          The second study aimed to identify a dietary pattern associated with development
of T2D (124). It examined data from 7339
British civil servants in the Whitehall II Study who were followed for an average
of 12 y. The study used reduced rank regression to identify a dietary pattern that
was associated with increased risk of incident T2D (adjusted HR: 1.51; 95% CI:
1.10, 2.09; P &lt; 0.0001). This pattern was characterized by
high consumption of soft drinks, onions, burgers, crisps, and white bread and low
consumption of medium- and high-fiber breakfast cereals. However, none of the
individual foods (including breakfast cereals) showed significant associations
with risk of T2D.
          One other relevant cohort study is from the Nurses&#x2019; Health Study (125). Although it did not analyze for
breakfast cereals specifically, it reported on whole-grain, bran, and germ intake
and risk of T2D and found a reduced risk with total whole-grain intake when the
highest and lowest quintiles of intakes were compared (RR: 0.75; 95% CI: 0.68,
0.83; P &lt; 0.001). The results for bran were similar (RR:
0.72; 95% CI: 0.65, 0.80; P &lt; 0.001), but there was no
significant relation with germ intake. However, the whole grain and bran in these
studies were from all foods, so would include bread and other grain food sources
as well as breakfast cereals.
          Overall, there were conflicting results from these cohort studies. Although the
Physicians&#x2019; Health Study showed a protective effect of all breakfast
cereals, the Melbourne and Whitehall studies did not find this. It may be that the
protective effects of whole-grain cereals or cereals with bran were diluted in
these studies, which did not separate out breakfast cereals by subtypes.

          Cross-sectional studies.
          There were 3 relevant cross-sectional studies. A small Malaysian study in diabetic
subjects found an association between oat consumption and better blood glucose
control but no relation with cornflakes (113). A U.S. study in young adults reported that RTEC consumers were
less likely to be overweight or have elevated serum insulin, but the only
association related to diabetes was a slightly higher glycosylated hemoglobin
concentration in those who included RTEC in their breakfasts. There was no
difference in the prevalence of metabolic syndrome (114). Results from the 2001&#x2013;2008 NHANES showed that,
compared with breakfast skippers, RTEC breakfast consumers aged 19&#x2013;51 y
were less likely to have elevated blood glucose and metabolic syndrome, but there
were no differences in those aged 51&#x2013;70 y (115).

          Intervention trials.
          Most of the other evidence comes from 11 short-term studies examining the effect
of different food products on carbohydrate metabolism (126&#x2013;136).
Table 6 summarizes the
results from these RCTs: 6 in diabetic and 5 in nondiabetic adults. All but 1 were
short-term studies comparing the effect of different breakfast cereals on glucose
and insulin responses. One 6-mo study compared the effect of high- or low-GI
cereals added to the diet of subjects with non&#x2013;insulin-dependent diabetes
(131).

                  2 oat bran mueslis, made with 3 or 4 g of
&#x3B2;-glucan, served with vanilla yogurt, plus a sandwich of white
bread, cheese, and butter
                  AUC of blood glucose and insulin measured
over 2 h after breakfast meal
                  Muesli with 3 g &#x3B2;-glucans gave no significant
difference in glycemic response compared with the reference.

                  Meals standardized to a total of 50 g available CHO
                  Muesli with 4 g &#x3B2;-glucans compared with a
reference meal (no muesli) produced a lower glycemic response:

                  Postprandial plasma glucose and insulin
measured over 3 h
                  The 10-g &#x3B2;-glucan cereal significantly reduced

did not differ between cereals.

                  10 g &#x3B2;-glucan cereal significantly reduced AUC

          Several studies reported improved glucose or insulin responses with oat-, barley-,
or psyllium-based cereal or muesli breakfasts compared with other breakfast
cereals in diabetic subjects (126, 127, 129, 131, 136), and the effect was also seen in some
studies in normal subjects when cereals with &#x3B2;-glucan were studied (130, 134). In normoglycemic subjects, higher-fiber breakfast cereals seemed
to reduce postprandial plasma glucose responses (132), but 2 studies found no difference between oat- and
wheat-based breakfast cereals in this regard (133, 135). One study reported
no difference in insulin or glucose responses in subjects with
non&#x2013;insulin-dependent diabetes whether breakfast cereals were sweetened
with 40% sucrose or were unsweetened (128).
          Several of the studies compared the effects of high- and low-GI breakfast cereals.
However, many factors can affect GI values, and its practical application may be
limited as a method of assessing the healthiness of individual foods. This is
supported by a study in women who consumed high- or moderate-GI breakfast cereal
breakfasts (GI: 77 vs. 51) (137). There
were no differences related to the breakfast type in plasma glucose or insulin
responses, nor estimated fat and carbohydrate oxidation rates during the
subsequent exercise periods. Furthermore, a recent study of 43 Australian
breakfast cereals showed that there was no relation between the sugar content and
the GI value of breakfast cereals (82).
          In summary, there are few long-term studies examining the relation between
breakfast cereal consumption and diabetes risk. There is some evidence supporting
the role of breakfast cereals, especially those higher in fiber, in the management
of diabetes, but the evidence is not strong. Table 7 summarizes the evidence, but more studies in
different populations are needed to confirm these relations.

        Cardiovascular disease

          Meta-analyses and reviews.
          There are no meta-analyses of the relation of breakfast cereals with the incidence
of cardiovascular disease (CVD). However, there are 5 meta-analyses of whole-grain
cereals generally (138&#x2013;142), which all reported a finding of
reduced risk of coronary heart disease with whole-grain consumption, ranging from
19% to 30% reductions with intakes of &#x2265;3 servings/d. Similarly, a
meta-analysis of the effect of dietary fibers on blood cholesterol reported
significant decreases in total and LDL cholesterol with the consumption of oats
and psyllium (143), and a recent
meta-analysis concluded that insoluble fiber from cereal sources is inversely
associated with risk of coronary heart disease and CVD (144).
          Bioactive components of the aleurone in bran may be particularly important in
reducing the risks of CVD (145), and the
position of the ASN is that &#x201C;consumption of foods rich in cereal fiber or
mixtures of whole grains and bran is modestly associated with reduced risk of
obesity, T2D, and CVD&#x201D; (146).
          A Cochrane review of whole grains and heart disease noted specifically that 8 of
the 10 studies were with oats, and that their meta-analysis found effects of lower
total cholesterol (&#x2212;0.20 mmol/L; 95% CI: &#x2212;0.31, &#x2212;0.01 mmol/L;
P = 0.0001) and LDL cholesterol (&#x2212;0.18 mmol/L;
95% CI: &#x2212;0.28, &#x2212;0.09 mmol/L; P &lt; 0.0001)
from oats (141). There are also
meta-analyses reporting significant cholesterol-lowering effects of barley
(&#x2212;0.30 mmol/L; 95% CI: &#x2212;0.39, &#x2212;0.21 mmol/L;
P &lt; 0.001) (147) and psyllium-enriched cereals (&#x2212;0.30 mmol/L; 95% CI:
&#x2212;0.40, &#x2212;0.20 mmol/L; P = 0.001) (148).
          At least 8 other systematic literature reviews (149&#x2013;156) all reported
a finding of reduced risk of coronary heart disease with oat, barley, or psyllium
consumption, ranging from 19% to 30% reductions in cholesterol concentrations with
the highest intakes of &#x2265;3 servings/d.

          Cohort and case-control studies.
          Four cohort studies and 1 case-control study reported on CVD outcomes with
breakfast cereal consumption (Table
8). The study in UK vegetarians only looked at bran-based
breakfast cereals and found no relation with ischemic heart disease incidence, but
the other 4 studies all reported protective effects from whole-grain breakfast
cereal consumption.

          Intervention trials.
          Most intervention trials measured short-term effects on blood lipids or blood
pressure. Four looked at the influence of folate-fortified breakfast cereals on
plasma homocysteine. In addition to those studies in the reviews and
meta-analyses, 3 recent RCTs with oat-based breakfast cereals confirmed their
cholesterol-lowering effects. A 12-wk study in overweight Taiwanese subjects
reported a 10% reduction in total and LDL cholesterol when 2 servings of oat
cereals were consumed per day (103). A
12-wk U.S. study in 204 overweight and obese adults found that 2 portions/d of
ready-to-eat oat cereal lowered total cholesterol by 5.4% and non&#x2013;HDL
cholesterol by 6.3% (86). In Australia, a
6-wk trial providing mildly hypercholesterolemic men and women with 3.2 g of
&#x3B2;-glucan/d in 2 servings of oat-based porridge or cereal bars resulted in
reductions of 7.8% in total cholesterol and 8.4% in LDL cholesterol (157).
          Wheat-based cereals do not have any effect on serum cholesterol. The 2002 review
by Truswell (156) noted that of 34
published trials with wheat fiber, 27 showed no effect and 2 showed increases in
total cholesterol. This negative finding has been repeated in several recent
trials with wheat-based breakfast cereals (158&#x2013;160).
          A Canadian study in 72 subjects with T2D randomly assigned them to 10% more energy
from carbohydrate in the form of low-GI breakfast cereals (Bran-Buds or oat
cereals with psyllium) (Kellogg) or high-GI options [cornflakes (Nature's
Path), puffed rice (Arrowhead Mills), or crispy rice (Our Compliments)], with a
higher MUFA control (131). There were no
significant differences in serum total, LDL, or HDL cholesterol between the 2
types of breakfast cereals, nor any significant effect on blood lipids over the
6-mo study (161).
          One study that added 60&#x2013;80 g/d of 2 refined-grain breakfast cereals
(Kellogg Corn Flakes and Rice Krispies) to the diets of 209 free-living subjects
in Finland found that this led to a 2.5% reduction in saturated fat intake and a
subsequent small (1%) reduction in total cholesterol over one 6-wk period, which
was significantly different from controls only because their concentrations
increased over the same time (P = 0.007). However, in a
second arm of the study, there was no effect on blood lipids (91).
          High plasma total homocysteine (tHcy) may be an independent risk factor for CVD
(162) and supplemental folate can
decrease homocysteine concentrations. Several studies showed that folate-fortified
RTEC can reduce elevated homocysteine (163&#x2013;165), and 1 New
Zealand trial reported that fortified breakfast cereal was more effective in
reducing tHcy concentrations than supplements or dietary education (166). Another study in 70 subjects at the
upper end of the normal range of tHcy found that 4 wk of daily consumption of
breakfast cereal fortified with 100 &#x3BC;g of folate resulted in a 16%
reduction in tHcy (167).
          However, these results should be interpreted cautiously. Subjects with moderate
homocysteine concentrations who are already eating other folate food sources
regularly may not benefit (168), and a
meta-analysis of 19 studies concluded that B-vitamin supplementation to reduce
homocysteine does not have any significant effect on risk of CVD (169).

          Cross-sectional studies.
          Ten cross-sectional studies were identified, which were not included in the
systematic reviews (32, 40, 110, 113&#x2013;115, 170&#x2013;173). Given the
low value of cross-sectional designs, only brief descriptions of these studies are
summarized in Supplemental Table 6.
          In summary, there is strong evidence from the RCTs that consumption of breakfast
cereals that are sources of soluble fiber (from oats, barley, and psyllium) is
associated with better cardiovascular lipid profiles &#x2014;specifically lower
total and LDL cholesterol&#x2014;although there seems to be no effect on HDL
cholesterol. There are few intervention studies examining the long-term risk of
CVD outcomes, but the few cohort and case-control studies mostly support a
protective effect for whole-grain breakfast cereals. Table 9 summarizes the body of evidence
statements.

        Hypertension
        Evidence examining the relation between breakfast cereals and hypertension is limited
to just 3 RCTs, 1 cohort and 2 cross-sectional studies (Table 10). The most convincing evidence comes from
the Physicians&#x2019; Health Study (174).
It found a 19% reduction in hypertension risk with daily breakfast cereal consumption
and a stronger relation with whole-grain than with refined-grain cereals. The authors
suggested that a number of components in cereals&#x2014;including folate, magnesium,
potassium, and fiber&#x2014;may be responsible for this effect. However, these
results were obtained in physicians who are likely to have generally healthy
lifestyles, and the results do not provide any data on hypertension risk in
women.

        In the 2 cross-sectional studies analyzing data from NHANES, the consumption of RTEC
at breakfast was associated with a 36% reduction in hypertension risk (114, 115, 173). The results from the
3 RCTs are less consistent and were all primarily focused on oats. One study with
both oat- and wheat-based cereals reported no effect on blood pressure (175). Of the 2 others with oats, 1 found a
reduction in the need for hypertensive medication (176), whereas the other found a hypotensive effect of foods with
&#x3B2;-glucan (of which only 2 of the 3 daily servings were from breakfast
cereals), but only in obese, hypertensive subjects (177). None of these studies examined the effect of breakfast
cereals in normotensive subjects. The evidence base is therefore very limited, if
suggestive, and this is reflected in the evidence summary in Table 11.

        Digestive and gut health

          Celiac disease.
          There has been debate about the extent to which oats may be tolerated in a
gluten-free diet because of their lower prolamine gliadin content compared with
wheat, rye, and barley. Uncontaminated oats are consumed by &gt;70% of
patients with celiac disease in countries such as Sweden, Finland, and The
Netherlands (178), and at least 1
randomized trial found that oats do not induce antibody responses in children with
celiac disease (179). The Canadian
Celiac Association notes that it is possible to produce oats without contamination
from other grains and that in well-controlled individuals the incorporation of up
to 50&#x2013;70 g/d of pure oats may be possible (180).
          One systematic review of 15 clinical studies in adults and children concluded that
the majority of people with celiac disease can tolerate moderate amounts of pure
oats, but that individuals should have both initial and long-term assessments by a
health professional when introducing oats (181). A more recent systematic review identified 17 primary studies, of
which 6 met inclusion criteria. None of the 6 studies found any significant
differences in the serology between oat consumers and control groups, although 2
found significant differences in intraepithelial lymphocyte counts (182). The authors concluded that oats can
be symptomatically tolerated by most patients but that long-term effects of a diet
with oats remain unknown.
          These conclusions were supported by a recent double-blind multicenter study in 8
pediatric clinics in Sweden with 93 patients on strict gluten-free diets, which
showed that the addition of moderate amounts of oats (25&#x2013;50 g/d) did not
prevent clinical or small bowel mucosal healing or humoral immunologic
downregulation in children (183).

          Laxation and constipation.
          The effect of dietary fiber on stool weight was estimated in a meta-analysis of
&gt;100 studies (184). Breakfast
cereals provide 8&#x2013;12% of the dietary fiber in adult diets in the United
States, the United Kingdom, and Australia (64, 185, 186) and therefore have an important role
in supporting healthy laxation, but clearly this varies depending on the type of
breakfast cereal and its fiber content.
          Several studies have shown that adding dietary fiber (via bran or other means) to
breakfast cereals in institutional settings such as nursing homes can alleviate
problems of constipation (187&#x2013;190), but there
have been few studies directly examining the association of breakfast cereal
consumption with digestive problems generally. Five such studies were
identified&#x2014;4 randomized trials (1 reported in 2 separate articles) and 1
cross-sectional study&#x2014;and are summarized in Table 12. The number of studies is small, but
the consistent findings, supported by many other studies on dietary fiber in other
forms, allows an evidence statement to be developed with confidence (Table 13).

and dental health in children and adolescents (Table 14). No studies in adults were found. In all but 1
of these studies (191) the authors reported
the total sugar content of cereal products, which includes not only added sucrose but
also sugars from fruit or milk ingredients.

        One study examined the cariogenic potential of PS breakfast cereals by using 3
methods to measure the in vitro ability of a cariogenic strain of
Streptococcus mutans to produce acid from fermentable
carbohydrate after the consumption of breakfast cereal by volunteers either with or
without milk (192). The 12 cereals tested
ranged in total sugar content from 3% to 45.9%, with 9 cereals containing &gt;25%
sugar. A positive correlation was found between total sugar content and the
production of acid, and the 6 cereals with the greatest pH change had a total sugar
content of &#x2265;42%. The cereals judged the least cariogenic (with the smallest
change in pH, concentration of calcium release from hydroxyapatite, and decreased
salivary retention time) all had total sugar contents of &lt;10%.
        However, because of the complex interactions between dietary constituents and teeth
in the development of dental caries, it is not possible to give absolute
determinations of cariogenicity (193). Most
breakfast cereals are consumed with milk, which acts as a buffer in pH lowering, and
the calcium encourages enamel remineralization (191). All 3 studies in Table 14
showed no relation between breakfast cereal consumption, although, interestingly, all
showed lower (but nonsignificant) caries incidence among cereal consumers. This might
be related to the known role of breakfast cereal consumption in promoting high milk
intakes. Table 15 sets out an
evidence summary based on the 3 studies.

        Other relations

          All-cause mortality.
          Two cohort studies examined the relation of breakfast cereal consumption to
overall mortality. In 1984, the 21-y follow-up of 27,530 adults in the Seventh-day
Adventist study calculated the adjusted OR of all-cause mortality when the
most-frequent and the least-frequent breakfast cereal consumers were compared as
0.84 (95% CI: 0.73, 0.97; P &lt; 0.01) (194).
          In the U.S. Physicians&#x2019; Health Study, over a mean follow-up of 5.5 y, total
mortality was inversely associated with whole-grain breakfast cereal intake (OR:
0.83; 95% CI: 0.73, 0.94; P &lt; 0.001) but not with
refined-grain breakfast cereal intake (OR: 1.09; 95% CI: 0.95, 1.25;
P = 0.07) (195). The OR for total breakfast cereals was also not significantly
different from unity (OR: 0.92; 95% CI: 0.82, 1.02; P =
0.07). It is striking that the results from the Adventist study were very similar
to those for whole-grain cereals in the Physicians&#x2019; Health Study, which may
reflect a likely preference for whole-grain cereals in the former group.

          Cancer.
          There have been no reviews specifically about the impact of breakfast cereal
consumption on cancer risk, although there are a number of reviews and
meta-analyses on the relation between dietary fiber, cereal fiber, and cereal
foods generally with risk of cancer (196&#x2013;199).
          There has been concern about the potential carcinogenic risks of acrylamide in
cereals since the International Agency for Research on Cancer designated it a
&#x201C;probable human carcinogen&#x201D; in 1994. In most Western countries,
breakfast cereals contribute only 2&#x2013;10% of total acrylamide intake (200&#x2013;202). A recent study in participants of the Health
Professionals Follow-Up Study estimated that cold breakfast cereals contributed
13% of total acrylamide intakes in the United States but there was no association
between acrylamide intake and risk of prostate cancer (203). Other prospective studies of breast and colon cancer
also found no significant associations with acrylamide intake (204&#x2013;206).
          It has been suggested that whole grains are a major source of vitamins, minerals,
and phytochemicals, which have anticancer properties (207). Dietary fiber could also decrease colorectal cancer
risk by increasing stool bulk, diluting fecal carcinogens, and decreasing transit
time (208). In addition, bacterial
fermentation of fiber results in the production of short-chain FAs, which may have
protective effects (209).
          A total of 13 studies examined the effect of breakfast cereals with a range of
cancer types (colorectal, lung, endometrial, breast, prostate, and pancreas) in 5
cohort and 5 case-control studies and 3 RCTs (210&#x2013;222). It should be
noted that some of these studies were with wheat bran&#x2013; or bran-based
cereals only. In none of the studies reporting all cancer or lung, colorectal,
breast, or endometrial cancer outcomes were breakfast cereal intakes related to
cancer risk. One study identified an increased risk of pancreatic cancer (for
cooked but not cold cereal) (218) and
another for prostate cancer from whole-grain but not refined-grain breakfast
cereals (216), but there are no
plausible mechanisms that could account for these findings and they would need to
be confirmed before any firm conclusions can be made.

          Mental health.
          Feelings of well-being and positive mood state are increasingly recognized as
important components of good health, and there has been a growth in studies
looking at the relation of nutrition with these outcomes (223). Many studies in the literature have focused on the
role of the breakfast meal, rather than breakfast cereals in particular. This
search identified 7 cross-sectional studies (224&#x2013;230) and 9
intervention trials (229, 231&#x2013;238) that examined the effects of a breakfast cereal on
mood, stress, anxiety, and depression. All of the cross-sectional studies
suggested that regular breakfast cereal consumers have lower levels of mental
health problems, including less stress, anxiety, and depression. However, with
studies of this type there is always the possibility of reverse causality: that
stress and mental health problems lead to changes in diet. Therefore, intervention
studies are particularly important to understand the potential relation.
          In 3 of the intervention studies (229,
231, 235), breakfast cereal consumption was compared with no
food for breakfast, so it is not possible to draw any conclusions about the effect
of the type of breakfast food&#x2014;the effects are likely to be a general
breakfast (or carbohydrate) consumption effect. Two of the other studies used
high-fiber, wheat-based cereals in the intervention, so the applicability to
breakfast cereals in general is also uncertain. Authors of 1 study comparing a
breakfast cereal with a muffin breakfast suggested that some of the differences
were due to perceptions of different energy content of the breakfasts. That study
also included toasted bread along with cereal in the &#x201C;breakfast
cereal&#x201D; intervention. There have been no studies in subjects selected
because of high levels of anxiety or depression.
          Given the diverse interventions and outcome measures used in these studies, much
more research is needed to understand the relations between well-being and
breakfast cereals.

          Cognitive performance.
          One review of 22 studies examining the association of breakfast consumption and
academic performance in children and adolescents concluded that breakfast
consumption may improve cognitive function related to memory, test grades, and
school attendance (17). The effects could
come from alleviating hunger, or they might be attributable to enhanced blood
glucose (239).
          A more recent review of 45 articles concluded that breakfast consumption is more
beneficial than skipping breakfast, but that this effect is mainly apparent in
children whose nutritional status is compromised (240). The authors noted, &#x201C;there is a lack of
research comparing breakfast type, precluding recommendations for the size and
composition of an optimal breakfast for children&#x2019;s cognitive
function.&#x201D;
          Most studies have focused on the cognitive functioning of children. There is 1
prospective study of RTEC consumption among 3831 men and women aged &gt;65 y
in Utah who were followed for 11 y and had their cognitive function assessed by
the Modified Mini-Mental State Examination (241). In multivariate models, more frequent RTEC consumption was not
associated with cognitive benefit, and daily RTEC consumers had patterns of
cognitive decline over 11 y similar to infrequent consumers.
          Seven RCTs looked at the effect of breakfast cereals on different measures of
mental performance: 1 in adults (242)
and the others in children and adolescents (229, 243&#x2013;247). The adult study found the best
alertness after an All-Bran meal, which is known to have a low GI. Four of the
studies in children compared high- and low-GI breakfast meals (243&#x2013;246). One study (245) reported superior performance in the high-GI breakfast cereal
group, but the other 3 reported cognitive enhancements with the low-GI breakfast
cereal option. None of these studies independently measured the GI values of their
test meals; all used calculated values. In 1 case other foods (bread and apple
juice) were added to the breakfast cereal meal. None of the studies seem to have
considered other possible explanations for the performance differences aside from
the glycemic effect of the foods.
          It is difficult to summarize results from these studies because a variety of
different outcome measures were used and in many cases only a small number of the
measured outcomes were significant. It appears that the consumption of low-GI
breakfast cereals may be beneficial for some aspects of the cognitive functioning
of children and adolescents, but more research in this area is needed.

          Physical activity and performance.
          One of the explanations for the observed association of RTEC consumption with
lower BMI is the association with lifestyle habits such as greater physical
activity and reduced television watching (248). One prospective cohort study in the United States in 2379 girls
compared the cumulative percentage of days that each girl consumed breakfast
cereal in childhood with results from 30-d physical activity diaries. Girls who
ate cereal more often were more likely to exhibit high levels of physical activity
and less television viewing (P &lt; 0.05) with no difference
according to the amount of fiber or total sugars in the breakfast cereals consumed
(92, 110). There was no association between physical activity
and number of days eating noncereal breakfasts (39).
          Another cross-sectional study in Greece in schoolchildren aged 12&#x2013;17 y
reported a similar relation. Multiple regression analysis revealed that the
consumption of breakfast cereals was associated with a higher likelihood of
participation in more physical activity (97). However, it is uncertain whether there is anything causal in this
relationship: it is very possible that families who promote cereal-eating also
encourage healthier lifestyles in general (249).
          A few clinical studies used breakfast cereals to examine the effect of foods
provided before exercise performance (250&#x2013;253). All of these
studies were in young active people and the performance testing regimes were
prolonged and strenuous, so their relevance for the normal population in everyday
activities is uncertain. Only 2 of these studies compared &gt;1 breakfast
cereal, and the only significant difference was in the trial that compared rolled
oats with puffed rice (253). The authors
assumed that this difference was due to the GI of the products, but there have
been no studies comparing foods of similar nutritional content with different GI
values.
          Given the paucity of relevant trials, it is not possible to develop evidence
summaries in relation to breakfast cereal consumption and physical activity or
exercise performance without further research.

          Other effects.
          There is some limited research on breakfast cereals and probiotic effects (160, 254, 255), immune function
(256, 257), exercise recovery (258), and anemia (259), but
the information is too preliminary to draw any firm conclusions.

      Discussion
      This review developed 21 statements on the evidence for the health benefits of breakfast
cereal consumption, including 2 Grade A, 5 Grade B, 11 Grade C, and 3 Grade D
statements. Evidence levels A&#x2013;C have been used to support the development of
dietary guidelines previously (260). Some of
the statements related to obesity, CVD, diabetes, and laxation are only for whole-grain
or high-fiber breakfast cereals, but many are for the whole category of breakfast
cereals. It should be noted that when the evidence is only derived from cohort or
cross-sectional observational studies the statements refer to an association with
breakfast cereal consumption, and do not necessarily imply a causal relation. Only when
there is good evidence from intervention trials do the statements use more direct
language (e.g., &#x201C;help lower&#x201D; or &#x201C;improve&#x201D;).
      Regular breakfast cereal consumers usually have higher daily milk intakes and are more
likely to meet their recommended nutrient needs: in particular, they have better intakes
of dietary fiber, B-vitamins, folate, calcium, iron, magnesium, and zinc. Much of this
effect is likely to be due to the fortification of many breakfast cereals. Breakfast
cereal consumption is also associated with diets that are lower in fat but not with
increased daily intakes of sodium or energy.
      A large number of cross-sectional studies all reported that breakfast cereal consumption
is associated with lower measures of overweight or obesity. Indeed, the consistency of
this finding in studies from many different countries in different age groups suggests
that there is no need for additional studies of this type to be undertaken.
      It is possible that a breakfast including breakfast cereal, especially one that is
higher in fiber, may provide better satiety and prevent overconsumption later in the
day. However, although there is evidence to support this hypothetical mode of action,
not all studies showed that total daily energy intakes are lower when breakfast cereal
is consumed; indeed, several studies showed just the opposite (24, 27, 38, 41,
59, 66, 261). This higher total energy
intake by breakfast cereal consumers may be because those who are overweight were trying
to lose weight by skipping breakfast, but the possible causal relations are unclear and
may not simply be due to reduced total energy intake.
      Another possible mechanism could be that breakfast cereal consumption increases energy
expenditure via better insulin sensitivity in the morning, but this is unlikely to be a
food-specific effect. On the other hand, breakfast cereal consumption may simply be a
marker for an overall healthy lifestyle and merely indicate eating and physical activity
patterns that are more favorable overall for weight maintenance. Thus, there is a need
for better-controlled cohort and intervention trials to understand this relation. There
is insufficient evidence to describe the best types of breakfast cereals to prevent
weight gain, although there are suggestions of a greater protective effect of
higher-fiber and oat cereals in some (but not all) studies.
      Studies that compared the effects of consumption of PS or non-PS breakfast cereals
mostly found no significant differences in daily nutrient or energy intake, although the
consumption of total sugars may be increased, and that consumption of PS breakfast
cereals does not increase the risk of overweight or obesity in children.
      There is an emerging evidence base suggesting that breakfast cereal consumption may be
associated with feelings of better mental well-being, improved cognitive functioning,
and reduced risk of hypertension, but better trials are required before any firm
conclusions can be drawn.
      There are several limitations of this review. First, it was undertaken by a single
author, whereas ideally at least 2 people would independently assess the studies.
However, the reviewer was experienced in this task, having led the evidence reviews that
supported the last review of the Australian dietary guidelines (262). Second, almost all of the studies in the literature on the
nutritional impacts of breakfast cereal consumption are cross-sectional in design
(mostly of RTEC only) with very few RCTs, which is a weakness in the evidence base
overall. Furthermore, the mechanisms for many of the health effects summarized in this
review are not always clear. In some cases, the fortification profile from added
vitamins and minerals may be a factor, but the natural nutrient content of cereals,
including inherent bioactive substances such as antioxidants and phytoestrogens, as well
as the significant contribution of breakfast cereals to whole-grain and dietary fiber
intakes, are also likely to contribute.
      In summary, breakfast cereals are relatively inexpensive, nutrient-dense, and convenient
foods, which can be recommended to form part of a healthy balanced diet. Their regular
consumption can help ensure an adequate nutrient intake and may assist in reducing the
risks of being overweight or of developing CVD or diabetes.
