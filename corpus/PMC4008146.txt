The prevalence of childhood obesity has reached epidemic proportions in the US and many other parts of the world. With obesity comes a variety of adverse health outcomes and metabolic complications. The liver in particular seems to be significantly impacted by fat deposition in the presence of obesity. In this article we discuss several aspects of childhood obesity from epidemiology and associated metabolic complications, to management strategies and therapy with particular attention to the impact of obesity on the liver resulting in non-alcoholic or metabolic fatty liver disease. The deleterious effects of obesity on the liver and health overall can be significantly impacted by a culture that fosters sustained nutritional improvement and regular physical activity. Here we summarize the current evidence supporting pharmacologic, behavioral and dietary interventions for the management of obesity and fatty liver disease in children.


   Scope of the Problem
Epidemiology of Obesity
Children have natural weight fluctuations as they grow, and so defining overweight in youth requires standardized growth charts that account for sex and age. Currently, for children aged 2–18 years, overweight is defined as a BMI &gt; 85th percentile and obesity is BMI &gt; 95th percentile adjusted for sex and age.1 In children younger than 2 years, a weight-for-length value greater than 95th percentile for age and sex is categorized as overweight. There are no normative data for BMI in this age group. Recent data from the 2009–2010 National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) revealed that 31.8% of children aged 2–19 years were overweight or obese and 16.9% of children were obese.2 The prevalence of obesity in children has increased three fold from the 1960s and 1970s.3

Comorbid Conditions
With the increasing prevalence of obesity in children, there has been a concomitant rise in the medical consequences of obesity in children. Overweight and obesity has been associated with orthopedic complications (slipped capital femoral epiphysis and Blount's disease), asthma, sleep apnea, diabetes mellitus type 2, dyslipidemia, liver disease and hypertension.4 Additionally, obese children often become obese adults.5 Overweight and obese children also incur greater medical costs from more frequent lab studies6 greater numbers of sick visits, and greater mental health service utilization.7 In terms of psychosocial comorbidities, obese children have reported lower health-related quality of life8 and had lower self-worth compared to normal weight children.9 Studies on depression in obese children are mixed with some studies linking obesity to depression and some showing no difference when compared to normal weight peers.10 Eating disorders may be more frequent among obese youth with one cross-sectional study revealing that 30% of severely obese adolescent girls manifested “unequivocal binge-eating”.11 There may also be higher rates of usage of diet pills, laxatives and vomiting to control weight.12

Nonalcoholic or Metabolic Fatty Liver Disease (NAFLD)
NAFLD has evolved as a key comorbidity associated with obesity.13 The presentation and severity of NAFLD can vary significantly, from isolated hepatic steatosis (which represents fatty deposition without inflammation) to non-alcoholic steatohepatitis or NASH (which encompasses steatosis, inflammation and ballooning degeneration of hepatocytes) to liver fibrosis and end-stage liver disease. Due to increasing rates over the last few decades, NAFLD is now considered to be the most common form of chronic liver disease in most of the Western World, with a prevalence ranging from 20 to 35% of adults and 5 to 17% in children.14 Children with NAFLD are usually obese and have associated features of metabolic syndrome; insulin resistance, impaired glucose tolerance and type 2 diabetes may also be present at diagnosis.15

Evaluation of Obesity in Children
Currently, the American Academy of Pediatrics recommends yearly evaluation of weight status using BMI measurement and assessment of dietary and exercise patterns to provide opportunities to intervene on poor dietary habits and sedentary behavior.16 Given that the medical consequences of obesity can involve every organ system, a thorough history and physical is paramount in the evaluation of overweight and obese children. Important considerations in the family history include the presence of obesity related disorders and parental obesity. Genetic factors have a strong influence on the development of conditions such as type 2 diabetes mellitus and cardiovascular disease in childhood.17 Sleep apnea can occur in severely obese adolescents18 and usually presents with night-time snoring and daytime somnolence. Obese children should also be questioned on the presence of wheezing and shortness of breath as asthma appears to be more common in this group as well.4 The American Diabetes Association currently recommends that overweight children (&gt;85th percentile BMI) with any two of the following risk factors be screened for type 2 diabetes mellitus: 1) family history of type 2 diabetes, 2) of Native American, African American, Hispanic American or Asian/South Pacific Islander ethnic background, or 3) have signs of insulin resistance or conditions associated with insulin resistance. Screening should start at age 10 years, or at the onset of puberty if it occurs younger, and should be performed every two years.19 Currently, there are no evidence-based guidelines on when and how to best screen for NAFLD in children. However, an AAP expert committee has suggested AST and ALT be measured biannually for children with BMI &gt; 95th percentile and those with BMI 85th to 94th percentile with at least one other risk factor.16 Screening for many of the psychological cobormidities of obesity can be accomplished using the HEEADSSS exam, which most pediatricians employ in every adolescent visit. This is a series of questions regarding Home environment, Education and Employment, Eating, Activities, Drugs, Sexuality, Suicide/depression and Safety designed to identify adolescents having difficulties in any of these areas during this high-risk developmental period.20

Medical causes of obesity in childhood are rare, however many pediatricians find themselves needing to address these causes because of parental concern. Hypothyroidism is among the more common causes of weight gain (acquired hypothyroidism has a prevalence of about 1.2% of children in the US).21 However, children with this disorder typically have a drop off in their linear growth and a decline in academic performance. Primary Cushing's syndrome is another rare cause of obesity in childhood. However, these children also typically have short stature. Finally, there are some genetic syndromes associated with obesity, such as Prader-Willi syndrome. These children typically have developmental delay and other medical conditions which precede the obesity.

Evaluation of NAFLD in Children
The diagnosis of pediatric NAFLD is commonly made after elevated serum aminotransferases are found during a routine check-up. Many centers have adopted a screening program for NAFLD in high-risk subjects, particularly in those presenting with features of the metabolic syndrome. Liver biopsy, the current gold standard for the diagnosis of NAFLD, is the only way to distinguish between NASH and isolated hepatic steatosis, determine the severity of liver damage and the presence and extent of fibrosis, as well as to rule out other diagnoses such as autoimmune hepatitis. However, routine non-invasive evaluation (biochemical parameters, imaging tests, and serum biomarkers) are used as the first step to confirm the diagnosis of fatty liver disease, especially in the typical patient with features characteristic of the metabolic syndrome.

Serum Biomarkers
In children with suspected NAFLD or NASH, baseline testing should include levels of aspartate aminotransferase (AST) and alanine aminotransferase (ALT), total and direct bilirubin, γ-glutamyltranspeptidase (GGT), fasting serum glucose and insulin, as well as a lipid panel. Aminotransferases may range from normal to four-six times the upper limit of normal, but mild elevations are usually seen, ranging between 1.5 to 2 times the upper limit of normal.22 Generally, the ratio of AST to ALT is less than 1, but this ratio may increase as fibrosis advances.23 Circulating levels of aminotransferases may fluctuate over time and may be normal in a large proportion of children with NAFLD and NASH.24 Furthermore, normal aminotransferase levels do not exclude the presence of fibrosis or even cirrhosis. Given that the majority of patients with NAFLD have some components of the metabolic syndrome, lipid profiles as well as fasting glucose and insulin levels, should be verified. Insulin resistance can be determined by fasting insulin levels or by further studies if necessary (glucose challenge or glucose tolerance test). Albumin, bilirubin, and platelet levels are usually normal unless the disease has evolved to cirrhosis. Similar to adults, some children with NAFLD may have positive autoantibodies (antinuclear and anti-smooth muscle antibody) in the absence of autoimmune hepatitis.25 The significance of this finding is still unclear.

Establishing the diagnosis and disease severity as well as monitoring children over time remains a major challenge for pediatricians taking care of the growing number of children with NAFLD. A Liver biopsy is still considered the goal standard, however this invasive procedure is not suitable for screening and risk stratification of children with this condition. There is a great need to develop non-invasive, simple, and reliable tests that can replace liver biopsy for these purposes. The currently available non-invasive tests as reviewed above have two central limitations: the inability to 1) distinguish non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH), from hepatic steatosis, and 2) to stage the presence and extent of liver fibrosis. Thus, identifying and validating potential novel non-invasive biomarkers is a central area of research. Diagnostics development in NAFLD have been divided into two major groups: those aimed at detecting and quantifying the presence of fibrosis and those aimed at establishing the diagnosis of NASH. Regarding the former, the pediatric NAFLD fibrosis index (PNFI) which is obtained from three simple measures [age, waist circumference (WC), and triglycerides (TG)] was recently developed to predict liver fibrosis in children with NAFLD.26 This index is easy to calculate with no additional cost to the patient and it has a good positive predictive value to rule in fibrosis; however, its negative predictive value is suboptimal. These limitations can be overcome when used in a sequential algorithm with the enhanced liver fibrosis (ELF) test. The ELF test uses a combination of three extracellular matrix components: hyaluronic acid (HA), amino-terminal propeptide of type III collagen (PIIINP) and inhibitor of metalloproteinase 1 (TIMP-1), and results in an accurate assessment of the presence of liver fibrosis in children.27 Future studies are still needed to externally cross-validate these findings before the combination of PNFI and ELF can be recommended in children with NAFLD. Moreover, longitudinal studies measuring these panels serially against clinical outcomes will determine if they can be used to measure disease progression and regression.

Hepatocyte apoptosis has been found to be a prominent feature in patients with NASH making it an interesting focus for biomarker development and for therapeutic intervention.28 A large body of evidence has demonstrated the utility of measuring plasma levels of caspase generated cytokeratin-18 fragments (CK-18, a specific by-product of apoptosis in liver cells) in the diagnosis of NASH in adult patients.29 Recently, Fitzpatrick et al demonstrated that children with biopsy proven NAFLD also showed considerably elevated levels of the CK-18 fragments compared to healthy controls.30 In addition, those with established NASH showed significantly higher numbers versus those with hepatic steatosis or borderline disease. These findings were further confirmed in a large study including more than 200 children with biopsy-proven NAFLD.31 Numerous other biomarkers of inflammation, oxidative stress, apoptosis and fibrosis are under investigation.32 However, more studies are needed to validate the existing markers and techniques and develop other accurate non-invasive predictors of disease severity.

Imaging techniques
Several radiologic techniques seem promising for quantifying hepatic steatosis (computed tomography, magnetic resonance imaging or magnetic resonance spectroscopy) as well as fibrosis (transient elastography). Liver ultrasonography (US) is the most commonly used imaging modality largely because it is relatively inexpensive, widely available and is user-friendly. Several studies in adults have demonstrated that this technique is highly sensitive and specific for detection of NAFLD.33,34 Moreover, liver US can provide a good estimate of the degree or extent of hepatic steatosis present based on a series of characteristics including hepatorenal echo contrast, liver echogenicity, visualization of intrahepatic vessels, and visualization of liver parenchyma and the diaphragm. Based on these characteristics, it was recently demonstrated that liver US is a useful tool for quantifying steatosis in pediatric patients who have suspected NAFLD, with ultrasound score strongly correlating with grade of steatosis on liver biopsy.35 Unfortunately, US sensitivity decreases when the liver contains less than 30% of fat. Furthermore, US cannot rule out the presence of steatohepatitis or fibrosis. Both computed tomography and magnetic resonance imaging studies, especially the new technique of magnetic resonance spectroscopy, are more sensitive techniques for the quantification of steatosis. However, they have been mainly used in the research setting and their clinical utility is limited by their cost and the need for sedation in children. Finally, none of these imaging tools have sufficient sensitivity and specificity for staging the disease and cannot distinguish between hepatic steatosis and NASH with or without fibrosis.

Several authors have demonstrated that transient elastography provides a high level of accuracy for detecting significant liver fibrosis, advanced fibrosis and cirrhosis observed in adult NAFLD.36 Transient elastography has also been validated to assess liver fibrosis through tissue elasticity measured by ultrasound technology in several liver diseases and may be useful in pediatric NAFLD.37

Liver Biopsy
Liver biopsy remains the ‘the gold standard’ for establishing the diagnosis of NAFLD and grading and staging the severity.38 In other words, distinguishing steatosis from steatohepatitis, and assessing the degree of fibrosis. Moreover, it is helpful in ruling out alternate causes such as chronic hepatitis C infection, Wilson disease, autoimmune hepatitis, and other metabolic liver disorders. In addition, histology permits the monitoring of disease progression and the response to therapy, because aminotransaminase levels may decrease during the course of the disease regardless of whether fibrosis progresses or improves. A central limitation for the use of liver biopsy is its invasiveness and the potential for significant complications such as bleeding. The histological diagnosis of NASH in pediatric cases may also be challenging as the features found in liver biopsy often differ from those commonly seen in adults.39 The typical adult pattern (termed NASH type 1) is characterized by the presence of steatosis (mainly macrovesicular) with ballooning degeneration and/or perisinusoidal fibrosis (zone 3 lobular involvement), with the portal tracts being relatively spared. Pediatric type NASH (NASH Type 2) is described as the presence of steatosis along with portal inflammation and/or fibrosis in the absence of ballooning degeneration and perisinusoidal fibrosis.40

Treatment
Goals
For obese children with or without NAFLD, lifestyle and dietary changes with resultant weight loss is the goal.41 For both conditions precipitous weight loss is generally not needed and in the case of NAFLD, this approach can actually be detrimental. Therefore, the focus should be on instituting healthier behaviors that over time will result in weight loss. It has been shown that 5% reductions in BMI are associated with clinically meaningful changes in waist circumference, and reductions in cholesterol, triglycerides and insulin resistance levels in children42 and significant improvement of liver enzymes in adults.43 For children with NAFLD there is an additional focus on treating the liver disease as well as the associated metabolic derangements. Pharmacologic therapy is limited to children with NASH given that those with isolated hepatic steatosis generally have an excellent prognosis from a liver standpoint.

Interventions for obesity
Family-based behavioral treatment (FBT)
FBT consists of nutrition and exercise education combined with behavior therapy techniques. It is a fairly intensive program where the child and parent(s) meet weekly to biweekly over several months for group classes and also receive one-on-one meetings with a behavioral coach for individualized goal setting and problem solving. The behavior therapy curriculum consists of self-monitoring of diet and physical activity, stimulus control, positive reinforcement, parenting skills, goal setting and relapse prevention.44,45 Stimulus control focuses on setting up the child’s environment to reduce food intake and sedentary activity, and increase physical activity. Positive reinforcement includes positive parenting skills (praise) and motivation systems where the child earns points for participating in program related behaviors. Parenting skills includes promotion of authoritative parenting style around eating and exercise, how to model healthy behaviors and set limits. Goal setting refers to contracting for immediate and long-term goals and the disbursement of rewards for achieving these goals. (Figure 1) The addition of these components to standard nutrition education has been shown to significantly improve weight loss.46 The importance of behavioral therapy was also shown in another study comparing a behavioral weight reduction program to the same program plus a short course on general child management skills. Both groups lost weight, but children whose parents received general child management training in addition to the weight reduction program had improved weight maintenance at 1 year follow-up.47 Golan et al reported that the use of behavioral modification techniques explained 27% of the variance in the child’s weight reduction.48

One important difference in behavioral therapy for obese children compared to adults is the necessity of parent involvement. One study compared the effect of targeting behavioral therapy towards the child, the child and parent, or a non-specific target. While all groups had similar weight reductions post-treatment and at 2 year follow up, the parent-child group had improved weight outcomes at 10 years follow up compared to the other groups.49 Going one step further, some studies have shown greater reduction in child percent overweight in parent-focused interventions when compared to child-focused.50,51 More recently, parent-focused programs which require the parent to master weight control strategies and then teach these strategies to their child without the child attending any treatment sessions themselves have proven to be equally effective as those including the child in treatment.52,53

In summary, several studies have proven FBT an effective treatment for weight loss in children and FBT is considered the gold standard for the treatment of childhood obesity. Long-term data has shown that 30% of children participating in FBT are normal weight after 10 years.49 Unique to the treatment of childhood obesity is the need for parent involvement for treatment success.

Dietary
There are very few studies of specific dietary approaches to achieve weight loss in children. Many studies of behavioral therapy in children have used the Traffic-light diet. This diet categorizes foods into green, yellow or red based on the energy density. Green foods are low in energy density and are allowed in unlimited amounts. Yellow foods are moderate in energy density and are to be “approached with caution”. Red foods are high in fat and simple sugar and should be eaten in very limited amounts. Families are instructed to eat very few red foods and eat as much green food as possible, but stay within a prescribed calorie range.54 This diet has been shown to decrease BMI in several studies of behavioral therapy.46,52,55

There are very few studies of altering carbohydrate content in children. In one of the few studies, a low carbohydrate, high protein diet was as effective as a standard portion-controlled diet in 102 children aged 7–12 years; i.e. both groups had lower BMI z scores at 12 month follow-up. However, the low carbohydrate, high protein diet had lower rates of adherence.56 Other smaller studies comparing low glycemic index diets to a standard reduced fat diet in adolescents have shown larger decreases in BMI among the low glycemic index groups.57,58

Pharmacologic
In order for a drug to become approved by the Federal Drug Administration (FDA) for weight loss treatment, it must result in at least 5% weight reduction in clinical trials. In adults, there are currently two appetite suppressant drugs approved, lorcaserin HCl (Belviq®) and phentermine/topiramate (Qsymia®). However, the only FDA approved drug for weight loss in adults and children is orlistat. Orlistat causes weight loss by decreasing fat absorption through inhibition of pancreatic lipase.59 There have been few trials of this drug in children. A small, short-term study in obese adolescents showed modest reduction of weight (−3.8 ± 4.1% from baseline) when given Orlistat in conjunction with a behavioral weight loss treatment program.60 In a larger, randomized controlled trial comparing the addition of orlistat or placebo to a diet, exercise and behavioral therapy program in adolescents, the orlistat group had a mean reduction of BMI by 0.55, whereas the placebo group increased by 0.31. The orlistat group had more gastrointestinal side effects than the placebo group (9%to 50% compared to 1% to 13%).61

Interventions for NAFLD
Non-pharmacologic
As described above for obese children, gradual weight reduction and physical exercise continues to be the gold standard of treatment for NAFLD in children.41 Weight reduction has been widely studied in adults and has been shown to improve not only the biochemical parameters but also the liver histology. Based on studies in adults, greater than 5% weight loss was associated with significant improvement in liver histology.62 The relative efficacy of weight loss and degree of weight loss needed to induce histologic improvement in pediatric NAFLD is unknown, but rapid weight loss is not advised as it may accelerate inflammation. In the context of evidence-based recommendations for NAFLD patients, advice is based on the pathological mechanisms of disease progression, favoring nutrients that have beneficial effects on the metabolic syndrome parameters as well as on inflammation. Consumption of carbohydrates should be limited (especially high fructose, high glucose diet) and low glycemic index foods prioritized. Saturated fats are limited in favor of monounsaturated fatty acids as well as polyunsaturated fatty acids (omega-3). Recent pediatric studies evaluating lifestyle dietary changes and weight loss have suggested that in a selective group of children effective intervention resulting in persistent weight loss is associated with improvement of serum AST and ALT, ultrasound liver brightness, as well as liver histology.63

Pharmacologic
Several drugs that improve insulin sensitivity such as metformin, or glitazones (rosiglitazone, pioglitazone), lipid-lowering agents such as clofibrate, or gemfibrozil, hepatoprotective agents such as ursodeoxycholic acid (UDCA), and antioxidants such as vitamin E, betaine, or N-acetylcysteine, have been proposed as potential agents for the treatment of NASH in both adults and children (Table 1).

Insulin-Sensitizing Agents
NASH patients with diabetes are at higher risk of developing more aggressive disease.64 Insulin-sensitizing agents such as peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-gamma agonists (glitazones), have been tested in adults with NASH with mixed results.65 The experience with glitazones in children and adolescence is limited and there are no studies assessing this medication class in children with NAFLD. Metformin has been shown to be safe and effective in the treatment of diabetes in children and is the only insulin sensitizing agent thus far evaluated in the treatment of NAFLD in children. Initial small pilot studies in pediatric NAFLD suggested improvement in serum ALT levels and reduction in hepatic steatosis as assessed by radiological means.66 However, a recently published large multicenter double-blind, randomized controlled trial of metformin or vitamin E in children (the TONIC trial) showed a complete lack of effect of metformin on both serum aminotransferases and liver histology.67 At the present time, the routine use of these agents in non-diabetic subjects with NAFLD should be discouraged outside of clinical trials.

Hepatoprotective, Anti-Oxidant Therapy
Several therapeutic agents thought to offer hepatocyte protection have been evaluated. Antioxidants have been hypothesized to decrease the oxidative stress and improve liver damage in NASH. A randomized controlled trial of Vitamin E in adults showed improvement in transaminases and fibrosis.68 Two pediatric studies with a small number of NAFLD patients and no assessment in histology suggested an improvement of liver enzymes but no changes in liver brightness on ultrasound with vitamin E treatment. A large randomized controlled trial of pediatric NASH with changes in liver histology as the primary endpoint failed to show an additional benefit of Vitamin E and C to a successful dietary weight loss program.69 Similarly, neither vitamin E nor metformin was superior to placebo in achieving sustained ALT reduction or in improving steatosis, lobular inflammation or fibrosis scores in the TONIC trial. The only histologic feature of NASH that improved with both medications was ballooning. Compared to placebo, only vitamin E significantly improved the NAFLD activity score and was associated with improved resolution of NASH on the repeat liver biopsy (58% vs. 28%; P value of 0.006). The authors suggested that vitamin E should be considered in a subset of children with biopsy-proven NASH and evidence of hepatocellular ballooning degeneration keeping in mind that the risk of biopsy may outweigh the benefits of therapy.67

Summary and Conclusions
Childhood obesity is a serious and widespread problem with one-third of children in the United States being overweight or obese. All of these children are at risk for a host of medical complications from their condition, including NAFLD. Screening for childhood obesity is extremely important and weight status should be evaluated via BMI at least yearly for all children. For overweight children, there are guidelines for screening for type 2 diabetes, but no evidence-based recommendations are available for screening for NAFLD and the other comorbidities. Furthermore, diagnosis of NAFLD remains difficult given the lack of reliable biomarkers and impracticality of liver biopsy. The gold-standard for childhood weight loss is family-based behavioral treatment. Pharmacologic therapy for weight loss in obese children is extremely limited and for liver disease, is limited to those children with NASH. Fortunately, even modest weight loss in children can have significant impact on their overall health.
