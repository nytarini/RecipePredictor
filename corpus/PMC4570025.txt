To examine test-retest reliability and internal consistency of a 5-question food insecurity survey used in the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey.

Methods
Researchers administered the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey in the classroom to 92 fourth-grade children (74 African American; 48 girls) in 2 sessions 27–30 days apart in spring, 2011. Each classroom administration lasted 5–10 minutes.

Results
Test-retest reliability was 0.66 (Kendall tau), which is modest. Internal consistency (Cronbach alpha) was .67 and .70 for respective administrations. Food insecurity scores were related to gender (adjusted P = .05) and academic achievement (adjusted P = .004) but not to socioeconomic status or body mass index percentile (binomial regression). On average, boys reported higher food insecurity than girls. Children with lower academic achievement scores reported higher food insecurity than children with higher academic achievement scores.

Conclusions and Implications
The National Health and Nutrition Examination 5-question survey may be group administered to assess food insecurity efficiently as reported by individual fourth-grade children.

   INTRODUCTION
Although food insecurity—inconsistent access to enough food for healthy living as the result of inadequate money and other resources—threatens only a minority of US households, the number of individuals affected is nevertheless substantial.1 Food insecurity has been associated with inadequate intake of key nutrients, increased risk for chronic disease, poor disease management, and poor psychological and cognitive functioning.2

Adult respondents’ reports about household-level conditions for the December, 2013 Current Population Survey Food Security Supplement indicated that at some time during 2013, 14.3% of US households were food insecure; of these, about 39% had very high food insecurity.1 According to adult respondents, children were food insecure at times during 2013 in 9.9% of US households with children.1 Food insecurity rates during 2013 were higher for households with incomes at or below the federal poverty line, for single-parent households with children, and for African American and Hispanic households.1

Most information about child food insecurity comes from parents’ reports about household food insecurity, but this is problematic for 2 reasons. First, because parents and children experience food insecurity differently,3–5 a parent may not be sensitive to salient aspects of a child’s perceptions of and reactions to food insecurity. Second, survey research on various topics (eg, children’s exposure to domestic violence, pain, dietary intake6–9) suggests that children are generally better situated than their parents to report their own experiences. Thus, relying on parents’ reports may limit accurate assessment of children’s food insecurity. Generally, over households, children’s food insecurity is correlated with that of adults, but because the relationship between child and adult food insecurity depends on children’s ages, measures of individual children’s and adults’ food insecurity may be more informative than a single household measure.4,10

Food insecurity questions for children have been developed and examined. Connell and colleagues11 used cognitive interviewing with children aged 11–15 years to develop a 9-question, child-reported survey deemed to have adequate internal validity for children aged ≥12 years. Using semi-structured, in-depth interviews with children aged 11–16 years, Connell and colleagues found that children described food insecurity in terms of quantity (eg, eating less than usual), quality (eg, having only a few low-cost foods), and psychosocial states (eg, worry, sadness, shame, fear), and expressed an understanding that adults tried to shield children from food insecurity.12 Fram and colleagues’5 separate interviews of adults and their children aged 9–16 years showed that children’s food insecurity experiences differed from parents’ experiences and from parents’ reports of children’s experiences. Bernal and colleagues3 found similar results with Venezuelan children aged 10–17 years. Interviews with British children showed that even children aged 9–10 years had knowledge of family finances and how those affected food choices. Fram and colleagues4 used cognitive interviews to develop prior survey questions into a 30-question, child-reported survey that was field-tested with children aged 6–17 years and validated by comparing survey responses with food insecurity classifications based on in-depth interviews with children. Children reported their food insecurity with high accuracy, with 6-year-olds as accurate as older children. Parents of these children also were interviewed; parents’ reports about children were inaccurate, missing half of children experiencing hunger.4

During 3 National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) cycles (2005–2006, 2007–2008, and 2009–2010), children aged 12–15 years answered the 5 food insecurity questions in the Figure.14 These were a slightly revised subset of Connell and colleagues’11 9 questions. Connell and colleagues found that children’s responses to the 9-question survey were internally consistent. However, little is known about test-retest reliability of children’s responses to the NHANES 5-question survey or about correlates of child-reported food insecurity.

This study investigated 1-month test-retest reliability and internal consistency of the NHANES 5-question food insecurity survey with fourth-grade children (who are 2 years younger than the youngest children asked these questions in NHANES). Also, this study investigated, for these children, the relationship of food insecurity scores to gender, socioeconomic status (SES), academic achievement, and body mass index (BMI) percentile.

METHODS
Participants
Data were collected during the pilot-study phase (spring, 2011) of a multi-year dietary reporting validation study with fourth-grade children15 from all 6 fourth-grade classes at 2 schools in a metropolitan school district in South Carolina. The University of South Carolina’s Institutional Review Board provided approval. Written parental consent and child assent were obtained.

Instruments and Measures
The Figure lists the 5 food insecurity questions and response options. Following US Department of Agriculture scoring guidelines (http://www.ers.usda.gov/media/476115/youth2006.pdf), affirmative responses (a lot, sometimes, and once/twice) were coded 1 and other responses (never, refuse to answer, and don’t know) were coded 0.11 These codes were summed over the 5 questions to yield a score of 0 (food secure) to 5 (very high food insecurity).

Children’s scores on standardized academic achievement tests served as a proxy for cognitive ability. Academic achievement was quantified by summing each child’s scores on the English Language Arts and Mathematics scales of the South Carolina Palmetto Assessment of State Standards.16

Each child was classified as low-SES or non–low-SES based on the eligibility of the child (or child’s family) for free/reduced-price school meals during the school year and for Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) benefits for 30 days before either survey administration. A child eligible for at least 1 of these programs was classified as low-SES; otherwise the child was classified as non–low-SES. Children from families with incomes ≤ 130% of the poverty level were eligible for free meals, and those from families with incomes &gt; 130% and &lt; 185% of the poverty level were eligible for reduced-price meals.17 The state’s Revenue and Fiscal Affairs Office–Health and Demographics section was authorized by the state’s Department of Education (for school meal eligibility) and Department of Social Services (for SNAP eligibility) to link data sets, conduct analyses, and provide aggregate results to researchers.

To calculate BMI, researchers measured children’s weight and height in the morning at school using established procedures18 after the first survey administration. Inter-measurer reliability, assessed on 10% of children per day of measurements, was 0.99 for weight and for height. Age/gender BMI charts were used to determine BMI percentiles.19

Survey Administration
In each classroom, for each administration, 2 researchers distributed paper surveys. Because the 5 questions concerned the past 30 days, before starting the survey, 1 researcher told children,
Each of these 5 questions is about the last 30 days. Thirty days is about the number of days in a month. Today’s date is ___. If we go back 1 month on the calendar, that date would be ___. So, the last 30 days would start ___ and go through today.



Dates were written on the classroom’s board. One researcher read each question with response options aloud while children followed along, and asked children to circle 1 response per question. The other researcher walked around the classroom to ensure that children answered accordingly. The first administration was in mid March. The second administration, in mid April, to the same children by the same researchers, followed the first administration by 27–30 days. The time between administrations was chosen to approximate the survey’s 30-day reference period and to decrease the likelihood that a child would simply repeat the first administration’s answers on the second administration. Each classroom administration lasted 5–10 minutes.

Analyses
Cronbach alpha assessed internal consistency, although for this type of data, it may slightly underestimate internal consistency.20 Kendall tau coefficient quantified test-retest reliability.21 A paired t test compared scores between administrations. Using a binomial regression model, scores from the first administration were regressed on gender, SES, academic achievement, BMI percentile, and their first-order interactions; because none of the first-order interactions was significant, they were removed and the model was refit. (Scores from the first administration were analyzed for the binomial regression because researchers would typically administer the survey only once.) For the binomial regression, gender and SES were dichotomous and academic achievement and BMI percentile were continuous. The Benjamini-Hochberg procedure22 adjusted for multiple simultaneous tests controlled the false discovery rate at .05. Statistical analyses used SAS/STAT (version 9.4, SAS Institute, Inc, Cary, NC, 2012).

Although 97 children completed the survey twice, SNAP benefits changed between administrations for 5 children; these children were excluded from analyses, which left a total of 92. Of these 92, academic achievement scores were unavailable for 5 and SES could not be linked for 4 of the 5; thus, for the binomial regression the sample was 87.

RESULTS
There were 92 children (48 girls), mean (±SD) age 10.1 ± 0.4 years; 74 were African American, 7 were Hispanic, 7 were white, and 4 were other. Mean academic achievement score was 1,235.3 ± 77.0 (range, 1,099–1,440); statewide mean was 1,280.23 Mean BMI percentile was 71.4 ± 26.7 (range, 1.0–99.7). Most children were low-SES (Table).

Internal Consistency and Test-retest Reliability
For the 92 children, internal consistency (Cronbach alpha) was .67 and .70 for the first and second administrations, respectively. One-month test-retest reliability was 0.66 (Kendall tau, P &lt; .001), which is modest.

Relationships
Food insecurity scores were related to gender (adjusted P = .05) and academic achievement (adjusted P = .004) but not to SES or BMI percentile (both adjusted P &gt; .94; binomial regression). Controlling for SES, academic achievement, and BMI percentile, on average, boys reported higher levels of food insecurity than girls. Controlling for gender, SES, and BMI percentile, children with lower academic achievement scores reported higher levels of food insecurity than children with higher academic achievement scores. These results are illustrated by the table’s mean food insecurity scores for children grouped by gender, SES classification, academic achievement (median split), and BMI percentile (below vs at or above the 85th percentile, an expert committee’s definition of overweight or obese for children24).

Degree of Food Insecurity
For the 92 children, over administrations, scores ranged from 0–5; this showed that children’s responses yielded the full range of food insecurity scores. For the 92 children, most children with scores of 0 on the first administration had scores of 0 on the second administration; 66% of children with nonzero scores on the first administration had nonzero scores on the second administration; for these children, second-administration scores tended to be lower than first-administration scores. For the 92 children, reported food insecurity decreased from the first (0.89 ± 1.26) to the second administration (0.61 ± 1.11) (paired t test, P = .006]. The table shows that for each gender, SES, academic achievement, and BMI percentile subgroup, average scores for the second administration appeared lower than for the first.

Of the first administration’s 460 responses (92 children × 5 questions) and the second administration’s 460 responses, frequencies of responses per administration (first, second) were a lot (15, 4), sometimes (67, 52), never (325, 357), refuse to answer (15, 13), don’t know (38, 34), and once/twice (0, 0). Thus, over 2 administrations, children rarely responded “refuse to answer” (28 / 920 = 3.0%) and infrequently responded “don’t know” (72 / 920 = 7.8%). Overall change in responses between administrations was for responses concerning frequency of experiences (ie, a lot, sometimes, never). The numbers of refuse to answer and don’t know responses were essentially the same in the first and second administrations.

DISCUSSION
The authors know of no other investigation of test-retest reliability of children’s responses to the 5-question food insecurity NHANES. For NHANES, children aged 12–15 years completed the survey; for this study, children aged 10 years completed the same survey. For this study, children answered the survey similarly on 2 occasions separated by 27–30 days, although mean scores decreased. The survey appears reasonable for use with fourth-grade children.

The authors expected modest rather than good test-retest reliability of the 5-question food insecurity NHANES for 2 reasons. First, some fluctuation in reported food insecurity was anticipated because the 2 administrations concerned different 30-day periods. Second, Connell and colleagues11 reported that their 9-question food insecurity survey (from which the NHANES 5 questions were derived) had “sufficient reliability to be a useful tool” (0.69) with children aged ≥ 12 years, but that reliability was worse with younger children. However, design and demographic differences challenge direct comparison with the current study because their study did not examine test-retest reliability and their sample was from a school with 85.9% white children, with 50% of the sample eligible for free/reduced-price school meals. The current study’s sample was 80% African American, lower in SES, and younger in age.

Decreased average scores from the first to the second administrations for the 92 children, and each subgroup, were baffling. The 2 administrations were in the middle of consecutive months, when the household SNAP benefits situation was expected to be similar. The authors cannot explain the difference.

Connell and colleagues11 found that the response patterns of boys and girls “were generally similar” on their 9-question survey, although Table 4 in their article shows that boys reported slightly higher food insecurity than girls. For the current study with the 5-question NHANES, boys reported higher levels of food insecurity than girls, on average. The authors cannot explain the gender difference.

Children with lower academic achievement reported higher levels of food insecurity than children with higher academic achievement. Although an association between food insecurity and academic achievement was previously reported,25 finding a relationship between academic achievement and children’s own reports of food insecurity is novel.

No relationship was found between children’s food insecurity scores and SES. Households using food assistance programs can be either more or less food secure than households not using those programs.1 Because those programs are intended to decrease food insecurity, households should be more food secure after receiving program benefits than before; however, it is the more food-insecure households that seek program assistance.1 The authors’ method of classifying children by SES may have lacked precision.

One study limitation is that the small sample was inadequate to examine test-retest reliability by children’s gender, SES, academic achievement, and BMI percentile. Children were primarily African American and of a single grade level. A strength was the temporal proximity of food insecurity survey administration (March and April), weight and height measurements (March), and school academic achievement testing (March and May).

IMPLICATIONS FOR RESEARCH AND PRACTICE
The 5-question food insecurity NHANES may help researchers and practitioners identify food insecurity reported directly by fourth-grade children. This survey may be group administered to efficiently detect which fourth-grade children provide food-insecure responses. The psychometric properties are modest for fourth-grade children. This type of tool is important to assess individual-level effects of food insecurity on children.11 Research is needed with larger samples of children diverse in race/ethnicity and age.
