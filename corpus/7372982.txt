mulsified meat products are being
produced (Gokalp et al., 2010), majority of
which have high fat content. For example, the animal fat content in emulsified meat
products such as frankfurters and bologna type sausages ranges between 20%
and 30% (Kang et al., 2016). In such
products, fat that is part of meat enters emulsion formula, and also it can be added
externally as an ingredient. The amount of fat that would be included in the formula
varies depending on the fat content of the meat used as a main ingredient.
Generally, 18%&#x2013;20% fat addition is sufficient for meats with
normal fat content, whereas 16%&#x2013;18% of fat addition would be
enough when fatty meats are used in the formula (Gokalp et al., 2010). The fat in the formula reduces the cost of
production, and plays significant roles in the formation of many functional
properties such as the development of sensorial and textural properties by imparting
of a certain taste and flavour and by giving softer and more palatability (Chen et al., 2015; Choi et al., 2010). When its level in the formula is reduced,
these essential effects of fats are eliminated, and the product becomes harder, more
rubbery, drier and darker, thereby becoming less acceptable (Sisik et al., 2012). There is a need for some changes in
product formulations in order to eliminate such negative effects.
      Emulsified meat products are easily produced and consumed, and their prices are
relatively low. However, the effects of emulsified meat products on health are still
in debate, as the increased consumption of saturated fatty acids has been associated
with detrimental health outcomes such as increasing the cholesterol levels and
triggering the formation of coronary heart diseases. Therefore, there has been an
increasing interest in development of emulsified meat products with
reduced-cholesterol and animal fat content (Jimenez-Colmenero et al., 2010). Having cholesterol-free property,
vegetable oils contain high levels of unsaturated fatty acids, tocopherols,
&#x3B2;-carotene, sterols, A and D provitamines (Jimenez-Colmenero et al., 2010; Zhuang
et al., 2016). Therefore, the use of vegetable oils in the productions of
emulsified meat products has become widespread and several studies have been
conducted to analyse the quality parameters of emulsified meat products containing
higher vegetable oil (Choi et al., 2009; Ozvural and Vural, 2008; Pappa et al., 2000).
      One of the vegetable oil that could be possibly used for the production of emulsified
meat is pumpkin seed oil (PSO). The high nutritional value of pumpkin seed and its
oil lately led to an increasing popularity. Preventing the growth of the prostate
(Gossel-Williams et al., 2006) and
decreasing diabetes by promoting hypoglycemic activity can be given as examples of
health promoting effects of the PSO (Zuhair et al.,
2000). Such benefits provided by PSO could be associated with a peculiar
composition rich in mono- and poly-unsaturated fatty acids, minerals, vitamins,
pyrazine derivatives, phytosterols, pigments and phenolic compounds (Nederal et al., 2014). PSO has already been
very commonly used in food applications; for example, it has been used as a cooking
oil, salad oil and for margarine production (El-Adawy and Khaled, 2001).
      No studies have been conducted to test the potential of PSO as an animal fat replacer
in the production of emulsified meat products. Therefore, the aim of the present
study was to investigate the possibilities of replacing of the animal fat with PSO
in various levels during bologna-type sausage production and quality criterion of
the product.

      Materials and Methods

        Extraction of pumpkin seed oil
        The pumpkin seed called &#x201C;&#xDC;rg&#xFC;p Sivrisi&#x201D; belonging to
the Cucurbita pepo species was used in the study. Pumpkin seeds
were purchased from Bahtiyar Dogan Food (Nev&#x15F;ehir, Turkey). After being
sun-dried, seeds were packed with polyethylene bag and stored at 15&#xB0;C.
Oil extraction and characteristic properties of the oil was previously defined
by Aktas et al. (2018).

        Preparing of the bologna-type sausage batters and processing
        Meat and beef fat used in sausage production were purchased from Kavd&#x131;rlar
Meat (Nev&#x15F;ehir, Turkey). For this purpose, 24 hours post-mortem
Longissimus thoracis et lumbarum muscles were obtained from
3-year-old beef carcasses. The meats were frozen at &#x2212;20&#xB0;C and
stored at this temperature until being used. Prior to production, meat and beef
fat used in sausage production were subjected to proximate analysis
(71.93%&#xB1;0.24 moisture, 19.70%&#xB1;0.36 protein,
6.92%&#xB1;0.26 fat, 1.00%&#xB1;0.01 ash, pH:
5.52%&#xB1;0.01; 16.76%&#xB1;0.36 moisture,
4.74%&#xB1;0.36 protein, 77.63%&#xB1;0.61 fat and
0.18%&#xB1;0.01 ash, respectively). Bologna-type sausages were produced
to ensure 16% protein, 24% fat, and 60% moisture content in
the final product. Beef fat was replaced with PSO in the levels 0%,
5%, 15%, and 30% to form meat emulsions. Preparation of
meat emulsions were based on the method by Aktas
and Genccelep (2006). Accordingly, meat and beef fats being kept at
&#x2212;20&#xB0;C were placed into a refrigerator before starting production,
partially thawed at refrigerator temperature (4&#xB0;C) and ground in meat
grinder. Meat were then placed into cutter (CTR10, Ar&#x131; Makine, Istanbul)
and chopped for 20&#x2013;30 s. At the end of the duration, nitrite curing salt
mixture (E-250; 99.5% NaCl+0.5% NaNO2) (Alfasol,
Istanbul, Turkey) was added at 2.5% and mixed for 20&#x2013;30 s. Half of
the water to be enter the formulation was added to the medium in ice-form and
the mixture were mixed until the temperature reached to 3&#xB0;C. Afterwards,
2.00% sausage-spice mixture (Alfasol), 0.25% polyphosphate
(Alfasol), 3.00% starch and the rest of the ice were added and mixed at
high speed until 8&#xB0;C. After mixing was completed, fat/oil was added to
the system and emulsification was continued until the temperature reached
12&#xB0;C. Finally, 0.01% hickory smoke (D402V, Dalgety Food
Ingredients, Dublin, Ireland) was added to the system and cutter was rotated at
low speed for a few rounds. The resulting emulsion batters were stuffed into 85
mm diameter cellulose casings by using a hydraulic filling machine (HD 15/40,
Ar&#x131; Makine, Istanbul, Turkey) and then crimped (Ar&#x131; Makine,
Istanbul, Turkey). The sausages were heated to an internal temperature of
72&#xB0;C in a 90&#xB0;C water bath, then cooled under tap water and stored
at 5&#xB0;C. This processing was carried out in duplicate for each formulation
(treatment) at different occasions. All analyses were carried out in triplicate
for each formulation.

        Physicochemical analyses of sausage batters
        In order to determine the pH value in sausage batters, 10 g of batters were
weighed and blended with 90 mL of distilled water, then pH values were
determined by using pH metre (PL-700PV, Taipei, Taiwan). The pH meter was
calibrated with buffer solutions at pH 4.0 and 7.0 prior to measurements.
Jelly-fat separation, emulsion stability and water-holding capacity (WHC) in
emulsion batters were determined based on the method of Aktas and Genccelep (2006). Emulsion batters prepared for
viscosity determination were placed in equal amounts into jars (73&#xD7;58 mm)
without leaving any gaps. Viscosity values have been observed in a rotating-type
viscometer (Alpha Series, Fungilab, Spain) with R7 spindle and at 1 rpm by
taking 1 reading at every 30 s.

        Color measurement
        The color intensities of the sausage samples during storage period (1, 7, 14, 21,
28th days) were measured using a Minolta (CR-400, Minolta Co,
Osaka, Japan) colorimeter with an 8 mm aperture, a D65 illuminant, a 2&#xB0;
closely matches CIE 1931 standard observer. The instrument was first
standardized using a white plate (C: Y=85.4, x=0.3176,
y=0.3255). Sausage samples were kept at room temperature for 45 min after
being removed from the refrigerator. At the end of the period, cellulose casings
were cut and color measurements performed. During the color measurements, the
background used was always the same, a white surface. The color values were
expressed in terms of the L* value (lightness), a* value (redness), and b* value
(yellowness) according to the system of the International Commission of
Illumination (CIE).

        Thiobarbituric acid reactive substances analyses
        Thiobarbituric acid reactive substances (TBARS) analysis in sausages during the
storage period (1, 7, 14, 21, 28th days) were determined based on
Lemon (1975).

        Texture analyses
        Textural characteristics of the samples were defined by using TA.XT-Plus Texture
Analysis (Stable Micro Systems, Godalming, Surrey, UK) device. Texture profile
analysis (TPA) and shear force (by using Warner Bratzler &#x201C;V&#x201D;
blade) tests were performed by using Texture Analysis device. Textural
measurements took place on the 1, 7, 14, 21, 28th days of the 28-day
storage period. For the TPA tests performed on sausages throughout the storage
period, discs with 3 cm diameters were obtained from 1.5 cm thick samples by
using cylindrical probe. Samples were compressed with P/100 probe in two
consecutive cycles at 30% of their original height with 5s interval
between cycles. TPA tests took place under 1 mm/s pre-test speed, 5 mm/s test
speed, and 5 mm/s post-test speed, trigger type-auto/force 20 g. Hardness,
cohesiveness, springiness, adhesiveness, gumminess, chewiness and resilience
values were recorded under the specified test conditions. Shear force (maximum
force of the curve) and the work of shearing (the area under the curve) values
of the samples (3 cm high and 1.7 cm diameter) were estimated with a
Warner-Bratzler blade attached to the same texture analyser. Shear test was
performed under 1.5 mm/s pre-test speed, 1.5 mm/s test speed, 10 mm/s post-test
speed, trigger type-auto/force 40 g, and 25 mm shear distance conditions. For
the penetration test, 3 cm thickness-samples were cut from sausage samples.
Penetration test was performed under 1 mm/s pre-test speed, 2 mm/s test speed, 2
mm/s post-test speed, trigger type-auto/force 5 g and 15 mm penetration distance
conditions. Penetration hardness (maximum force of the curve), work of
penetration (the area under the curve) and the resistance during the withdrawal
of the probe (the negative area of the curve) values were obtained by using P/2
penetration probe.

        Statistical analyses
        In the study, two independent batches of each sausage formulations were prepared
in a completely randomized design. All measurements were triplicated for
independently prepared batches. Data were represented as mean&#xB1;SE.
Analysis of variance (ANOVA) was performed to evaluate the statistical
significance of the sausage formulation and storage period, using SPSS 22 for
Windows (SPSS, Chicago, IL, USA). The data were analyzed using the general
linear model (GLM) procedure, in which treatment groups and storage period were
assigned as fixed effects and replications as a random effect. Duncan&#x2019;s
multiple range tests was used to see whether mean differences were statistically
significant (p&lt;0.05).

      Results and Discussion

        Physicochemical analyses of sausage batters
        pH, viscosity, jelly-fat separation, emulsion stability and WHC values obtained
from sausage batters are shown in Table
1. There was no statistically significant difference observed between the
pH values of emulsion batters prepared by using different levels of PSO and the
pH values of the control group. This agrees with previous studies that showed no
significant differences in the pH values of the emulsified meat products
prepared with various ratios of vegetable oils (Choi et al., 2010; Choi et al.,
2013; Choi et al., 2014; Choi et al., 2015; Pappa et al., 2000).

        Viscosity values of emulsion batters prepared using PSO (p&lt;0.05) were
significantly higher than those prepared with beef fat (Table 1). The increase in the level of PSO led to an
increase in viscosity values of meat batters. Various studies conducted with
different vegetable oils also reported that vegetable oils increases the
viscosity values of the emulsion batters (Choi et
al., 2010; Choi et al., 2014).
Viscosity of emulsion is an extent of the fluidity of the emulsion and, an
important quality criterion for the emulsion technology to impart a particular
texture to the product. Formation of an extremely viscous structure in meat
emulsions is not desirable. Because high levels of viscosity in emulsion batters
can lead to the formation of various air pockets, oil and gelatine vesicles
during filling and cooking, consequently leading to textural defects.
        Use of PSO in replace of beef fat also led to significant increases
(p&lt;0.05) in the amount of jelly-fat separation. The lowest jelly-fat
separation was observed in control group while the highest total expressible
fluid (TEF) (%) was observed in emulsion batters prepared by using
30% PSO (Table 1). TEF express the
mixture of fat and water separated from the supernatant, and is used as a
measure of the possibility of exudates during the storage period (Fernandez-Lopez et al., 2020). Therefore,
lower TEF values mean higher emulsion stability. The emulsion stabilities of the
batters prepared by using beef fat were significantly higher than those the
batters prepared with PSO (p&lt;0.05; Table
1). It is also possible to state that vegetable oils have a lower
melting point than animal fats and may adversely affect emulsion stability. The
finding observed in beef fat may be related to the fact that some of the fat in
the emulsion remains as undisrupted fat cells, thereby causing muscle proteins
to retain more water.
        Water-holding capacities of the sausage samples are given in Table 1. PSO up to the level of 15%
did not make any statistically significant difference in WHC (p&gt;0.05);
however, raising the incorporation level to 30% caused a statistically
significant difference (p&lt;0.05). A study conducted by Alvarez et al. (2011) to determine the
effects of canola-olive oil, rice bran and walnut on sausages reported that use
of canola-olive oil increases the WHC. WHC is defined as the ability of meat to
bind the internal and added water during the application of any force (Gokalp et al., 2010). It is a
characteristic properties listed among the important traits in emulsified meat
products, as a large of the composition of emulsified meat products are
comprised of water. Higher WHC indicates that the product has a better WHC.
Holding water within the structure is highly important due to economic and
technological reasons and water leaving the structure can cause losses in taste,
flavour and juiciness. Moreover, it has been reported that WHC in emulsified
meat products such as sausages has an important effect on consumer acceptance
(Liu et al., 2019).

        Color
        The L*, a*, and b* values obtained from sausages produced with different levels
of PSO are shown in Table 2. An increase
in the level of PSO resulted in a statistically significant (p&lt;0.05)
increase in the L* and b* values. a* value, on the other hand, was found to
decrease significantly (p&lt;0.05). The level of PSO&#xD7;storage period
interaction was found to had a significant effect on L*, a*, and b* values
(p&lt;0.05, Fig. 1). During the storage
period, the highest L * and b * values were determined in sausages produced
using 30% PSO, while the lowest L * and b * values were determined in
sausages belonging to the control group (Fig.
1). Fig. 1 also indicated that,
the lowest a* values of sausages were observed in sausages produced with
30% PSO, while the highest a* value were observed in control group.
Colour formation and colour stability are among the important quality
characteristics in meat products. Due to consumer attitudes, colour is being
deemed as an important quality indicator in meat and meat products. As
product-specific pinkish red colour are required in emulsified meat products,
determination of colour values is among the important quality characteristics
analyses. The increase in the L* value with the increase in PSO level was
attributed to the fact that vegetable oil is better and smaller dispersed than
animal fat. As vegetable oil disperses and distributes much better than animal
fat, light falling onto the surface is much more broken, thereby increasing the
effect of lightness. Also, smaller oil globules possess greater surface area,
which could cause more light reflection. Similar findings were determined by
Kang et al. (2016), Tan et al. (2001), and Youssef and Barbut (2009; 2010; 2011), who investigated the effects of soy oil, canola oil and palm
oil on the color of frankfurters. The increase in the PSO level led to a
reduction in the a* values of the sausages. The decreases in a* value was at
most 6.95%. The decreased redness caused by PSO level was probably due to
the distribution of oil phase into the matrix of myofibrillar proteins that
causes an increase in the surface of the fat particles. This result was in good
accordance with findings of Ambrosiadis et al.
(1996) who reported a lower in the redness values of cooked meat
emulsion containing vegetable oils. The increase that occurs in b* value may be
associated with the yellow colour of the PSO (Aktas et al., 2018). A similar result was also observed in meat
emulsions containing canola oil (Youssef and
Barbut, 2009).

group while the highest values were determined in sausages produced with
30% PSO in a 28-day storage at 4&#xB0;C. Oxidative stability is one of
the important quality criterion in processed meat products. During the 28-days
storage period, TBARS values of samples containing animal fat were significantly
lower than those of samples containing PSO. With the increase in PSO level,
TBARS values were shifted toward higher values. This increase in TBARS values
could be attributed to the fact that PSO contains a significant amount of
unsaturated fatty acid. PSO contains around 81% unsaturated fatty acid
(Aktas et al., 2018). Although an
increase in the TBARS values were observed, all of the obtained results were
below the acceptable upper limit in cooked cured meat products. Ockerman (1985) reported that TBARS value
of 1 mg malonaldehyde/kg sample is considered to be rancid that product would be
unacceptable. These findings agree with earlier reports use of vegetable oils in
emulsified meat products have been found to lead to a reduction in oxidative
stability (Choi et al., 2010; K&#x131;l&#x131;c and ozer, 2019; Pappa et al., 2000).

        Texture
        PSO caused a reduction in hardness, adhesiveness, chewiness values but an
increase in cohesiveness and resilience values (Table 2). Except for sausages produced with 30% PSO, no
significant changes were observed in springiness values. The level of
PSO&#xD7;storage period interaction was found to have significant effects on
all measured textural properties, except for cohesiveness values (p&lt;0.05,
Fig. 3). Textural structure of
emulsified meat products is affected by emulsion parameters, and characteristics
of meat-fat and additives used in the formulation. The texture of a good-quality
sausage should not be loose, too hard or too soft. There should be no fat and
jelly pockets on the section surface and it should be easily sliceable (Gokalp et al., 2010). Lower hardness values
obtained from sausages produced with PSO (compared to the control group, the
decreases in hardness was at most 5.06%) could be attributed to the fact
that PSO containing monounsaturated fatty acid have lower hardness values at
high temperatures. Also, the texture of animal fat is hard and solid. Wang et al. (2018) reported that animal fat
is a tissue and the adipocyte structure remains intact after production and,
causing an increase in the hardness of the structure. Luruena-Martinez et al. (2004) conducted a study on
frankfurters prepared with olive oil and carob/xanthan gum addition instead of
animal fat and concluded that samples with olive oil had lower hardness values.
The result of the research conducted by using sunflower oil indicated that
hardness value was detected to be decreased with the use of vegetable oil (Choi et al., 2015). In this study, the
tendency observed in cohesiveness, adhesiveness and springiness values was also
observed in a study conducted by Jimenez-Colmenero et al. (2010) using olive oil. The lower
cohesiveness value determined in the control group might be perceived as an
indication that the sausages in this group have a more easily broken
structure.

values.

        Shear results are given as two parameters: maximum shear force and work of shear.
Maximum shear force is defined as the force to cut the sample while work of
shear is defined as the work needed to move the blade through the sample. As
Table 3 indicates, the lowest maximum
shear force and work of shearing values were determined in sausages produced
with 30% PSO, while the highest maximum shear force and work of shearing
values were found in control group sausages. Similar maximum shear force and
work of shearing values were obtained from sausages produced with 15% and
30% PSO (p&gt;0.05), while control group and 5% PSO containing
sausages given statistically significant differences (p&lt;0.05).
Warner-Bratzler shear force is obtained by the maximum force required to shear
the samples while TPA hardness is defined as the maximum force required to
compress the sample (Bourne, 2002). Warner
Bratzler shear force results generally provide information about the tenderness
of meats. The results of Warner Bratzler shear indicated that the sausages
containing PSO were tender than the control group.

        The results of penetration analyses are given as hardness of penetration, work of
penetration and resistance during the withdrawal of the probe (Table 3). The lowest penetration hardness
values were observed in control group sausages, while the highest penetration
hardness value was observed in sausages produced with 15% PSO.
Significant differences were obtained between the penetration hardness values of
sausages produced by using different levels of PSO (p&lt;0.05). The trends
determined in penetration hardness values were also determined for the value of
work of penetration. The lowest resistance during the withdrawal of the probe
value were observed in sausages produced with 15% PSO, and the highest
resistance during the withdrawal of the probe value were observed in sausages
produced with 30% PSO. Similar resistance during the withdrawal of the
probe values were obtained in control group and in sausages produced with
5% PSO, but there were statistically significant differences between the
resistance during the withdrawal of the probe values of sausages produced with
other levels of PSO (p&lt;0.05). This might be attributed to the interaction
between oil and proteins. Shi et al.
(2014) noted that oil could act as filler in the matrix of gels in
meat products by placing the cavities of the protein gel matrix and restricting
the matrix against movement, thereby having ability to alter gel-forming
capacity in meat products.

      Conclusion
      It has been determined that the use of PSO in certain levels as a replacement of
animal fat had significant effects on the bologna-type sausage emulsion batters and
on the characteristics of the final product. Sausages prepared with PSO were
somewhat softer than sausages prepared with beef fat. Colours of the sausages with
PSO were lighter and less red than the produced with beef fat. Although TBARS values
of the sausages with PSO were higher than the sausages with the beef fat during the
storage period, this increase remained below the acceptable upper limit. The
obtained results lead to the conclusion that the pre-emulsified PSO would be yield
more positive results on the physicochemical and textural characteristics and also
that more researches are needed on this issue.
