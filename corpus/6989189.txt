        Human listeriosis results from the ingestion of foods contaminated with
Listeria monocytogenes (Lm). About 1600 listeriosis cases
are reported every year in the USA with &gt;95% hospitalization and 15&#x2013;20%
death. The proportions of persons with listeriosis hospitalized and who die are
very similar in Europe with slightly higher rates in Scandinavian countries. The
occurrence of disease requires adaptation, survival, and usually growth of
Lm in foods before consumption by members of the
susceptible population. Despite concerted efforts by the food safety community,
the disease incidence has not changed significantly since 2001 and remains
higher than the Healthy People 2020 target of 0.2 cases per 100,000
individuals.
        In recent years, human listeriosis cases have been reported to involve
non-typical foods, e.g. celery, cantaloupe, caramel apple, frozen vegetables and
ice cream. In some outbreaks, a few infected individuals were considered outside
the realm of the standard vulnerable population group. Our recent work with the
outbreak associated with ice cream samples, indicated that a low-level
contamination in a food that does not support growth can cause listeriosis in
highly susceptible populations. Separately, using a combination of polymerase
chain reaction (PCR)-based serotyping and whole genome sequencing (WGS)-based
analyses; we have discovered that a genetic variant of the serotype 4b strain,
called 4bV, was responsible for 3&#x2013;4 recent outbreaks in the USA. Three of the
four products associated with these outbreaks were grown in a small geographical
region of the USA while the fourth was never linked to a specific grower, but
rather a processing facility. These 4bV strains contain a 6.3kb DNA fragment
normally associated with lineage II Lm strains. The
significance of this DNA fragment in the serotype 4b background is currently
being investigated. This article reviews current listeriosis outbreaks with an
emphasis on the expansions in food niche, case demography and genotypes of
Lm. The discussion raises important questions about
Lm adaptation in different foods and environments and the
role of certain genotypes in such adaptation and disease outcome.
