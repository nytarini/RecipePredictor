 owing to its high biological value,
contains essential amino acids, high unsaturated fatty acid content, vitamins, and
other nutrients as well as its price (Pereira and
Vicente, 2013). Sausage is one of the most popular food products consumed
worldwide. Fresh sausages are products that are not heat-treated or cured. Fresh
sausages are formulated with variable meat species such as pork, beef, chicken,
fish, and fat. They are more or less coarsely minced or emulsified and also contain
additives, such as salt, flavoring agents, spices, coloring agents depending on
local preparations (Pearson and Gillet,
2012). The sausage dough is stuffed into natural casings and due to the
absence of heat and curing treatments in the production steps, products have limited
shelf life and they are susceptible to oxidative changes thus, ready products should
be kept under cold storage conditions until consumption. (Pereira et al., 2019).
      Fat is considered a fundamental material in meat product formulations since it gives
desirable textural and sensory properties to the products. However, consumption of
saturated fat has been linked with serious health problems such as cholesterol,
obesity, cardiovascular diseases and some types of cancer (Forouhi et al., 2018), thus developing a healthy lipid profile
has become one of the most important attempts in meat industry. Omega-6 and omega-3
fatty acids (PUFAs) are essential fatty acids that are taken from the diet, due to
the deficiency of enzymes for omega-3 desaturation (Bhardwaj, 2016).
      Black cumin oil is the essential oil from the seeds of Nigella
sativa, contains high amount of thymoquinone and its related compounds
such as thymol and dithymoquinone, which have been utilized in the prevention of
inflammation and oxidative changes (Lutterodt et
al., 2010). Dominating fatty acids of black cumin oil are 57%
linoleic acid (C18:2), 23.9%&#x2013;24.1% oleic acid (C18:1) (Ramadan and M&#xF6;rsel, 2002).
      Flaxseed oil is polyunsaturated oil extracted from the flax plant (Linum
usitatissimim) rich in &#x3B1;-linolenic acid (n-3) which is
50%&#x2013;60% of its total fatty acids. The high content of n-3 fatty
acid present means that the consumption of flaxseed oil may have health benefits,
thus enrichment of products with flaxseed oil enables to produce functional food
products (Singh et al., 2011).
      Even though modification of the fatty acid composition of meat products could be
accomplished by using oil sources rich in polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs) such
as black cumin or linseed oil in formulation, one of the important problems
regarding the use of oils rich in PUFAs is their high susceptibility towards
oxidation and consequent generation of rancidity. Therefore, these oils should be
protected in order to make them more stable against oxidative changes during
processing and storage (Carneiro et al.,
2013). In this respect, pre-emulsions create an opportunity to incorporate
healthy oil mixtures to meat systems for increasing mono and PUFAs content since
adding healthy oil mixtures directly to product formulation can have technological
problems and quality issues in meat products (Serdaro&#x11F;lu et al., 2017).
      It was shown that gelled emulsions (GEs) have the potential to carry functional
compounds and replace the beef fat in meat products (Pintado et al., 2015; Poyato et al.,
2014; Serdaro&#x11F;lu et al.,
2016). GEs prepared with olive, linseed, fish and sunflower seed oils
have been used in different products such as frankfurters (Delgado-Pando et al., 2010; Pintado et al., 2016), pork meat system (Salcedo-Sandoval et al., 2015), fresh sausages (Pintado et al., 2018); meatballs (Serdaro&#x11F;lu et al., 2017), patties (Alejandre et al., 2017; Alejandre
et al., 2019), burgers (Poyato et al.,
2015), meat emulsions (de Souza Paglarini
et al., 2018; Serdaro&#x11F;lu et al.,
2016), dry fermented sausages (Alejandre
et al., 2016; Glisic et al., 2019)
and bologna (de Souza Paglarini et al.,
2019a; Poyato et al., 2014) to improve
fatty acid composition.
      In this study, it was aimed to design a technological strategy to produce functional
fresh sausages by replacing beef fat in formulation with oil in water (O/W) GE
prepared with flaxseed and black cumin oil mixture, inulin, sodium caseinate (SC)
and gelatin. The technological and nutritional quality parameters, as well as
susceptibility of sausages to oxidation, are examined throughout the short storage
period.

      Materials and Methods

        Materials
        Chicken thighs were supplied from Lezita (Abal&#x131;o&#x11F;lu, Izmir,
Turkey), beef fat was purchased from a local butcher store. Black cumin oil was
obtained from a local producer (&#x15E;ifahane-i K&#xFC;bra, Izmir, Turkey)
according to the specifications of the supplier, fatty acid composition of black
cumin oil as follows; 28.22% oleic acid (C18:1), 7.61% palmitic
acid (C16:0), 58.85% linoleic acid (C18:2), 3.50% stearic acid
(C18:0), and 0.72% linolenic acid (C18:3) and other fatty acids. Flaxseed
oil (18.38 % oleic acid (C18:1), 5.53% palmitic acid (C16:0),
15.07% linoleic acid (C18:2), 3.88% stearic acid (C18:0), and
54.58% linolenic acid (C18:3) and other fatty acids) was supplied from
Ege University Agriculture Faculty (Izmir, Turkey). All the other ingredients
were obtained from local market. SC and gelatin were purchased from
Sigma-Aldrich (St. Louis, MO, USA), polyglycerol polyricinoleate (PGPR) and
inulin (Ash Content: 0.05%&#x2013;0.15%, Glucose:
0%&#x2013;1.6%, Saccharose: 1.05%&#x2013;3.05%, Dry
Matter Content: 93%&#x2013;97%, Carbohydrates: 94.90%,
Inulin: 88%&#x2013;92%, Fructose: 1.2%&#x2013;3.2%)
were supplied from Smart Chemical (&#x130;stanbul, Turkey) and BENEO-Orafti
(Istanbul, Turkey), respectively.

        Preparation of gelled emulsion
        O/W GE was prepared according to the method described by Poyato et al. (2014) with some modifications. The oil phase
(50%) was prepared with mixture of black cumin and flaxseed oil (1:1).
Oil phase also contained PGPR. The water phase (50%) consisted 2%
SC (per 100 g emulsion), 3% gelatin (per 100 g emulsion) and 7%
inulin (per 100 g emulsion). Both phases were heated to 55&#xB0;C on a water
bath (121 rpm) after mixing them separately in homogenizer (WiseTis HG-15D,
DAIHAN Scientific, Wertheim, Germany) at 516&#xD7;g. After the mixing and
heating stage, the oil phase was added onto the water phase in a high-speed
homogenizer with heating equipment (TM-31 Vorwerk, Wuppertal, Germany) at 275
rpm (setting 2.5), and then further emulsified at 700 rpm (setting 3). The
prepared emulsion stored at 4&#xB0;C overnight.

        Experimental design and preparation of chicken fresh sausage
        Four batches (Table 1) were prepared for
each treatment. In control samples (C) 10% beef fat was added, in other
formulations beef fat was substituted with GE at levels of 50% (G50),
75% (G75), and 100% (G100). Chicken thigh meat and beef fat were
minced through a 3 mm plate grinder (Promeat W2000 Grande, Arnica,
&#x130;stanbul, Turkey). Ground meat, fat source (beef fat and/or GE), salt,
half of the ice and other additives mixed in cutter (330S, Alpina, Schweiz,
Switzerland) for 5 min. The remaining part of the ice was added to the mixture
and the emulsification process was continued for 3 more min. Sausage doughs were
stuffed into natural edible casings (sheep intestine) using a hydraulic sausage
filling machine (SG-Alpina, Schweiz, Switzerland) and stored in sealed
polypropylene bags at 4&#xB0;C for 5 d. Analyses were performed on
0th, 3rd, and 5th d of storage (Fig. 1).

        Gelled emulsion stability
        GE stability was determined after the application of centrifugal forces at
323&#xD7;g, 3 min and heat treatment at 70&#xB0;C, 30 min (Serdaro&#x11F;lu et al., 2016; Surh et al., 2007). Creaming stability of
GE was measured according to the method described by Gu et al. (2005) after 7 d of storage at 4&#xB0;C, the
separated layer was measured and compared to initial sample height. Syneresis
(S) was analyzed according to Bot et al.
(2014). All parameters related to the stability of GE were determined
in triplicate.

        Moisture and ash contents of raw and cooked chicken fresh dough (uncooked) and
sausages (cooked) were determined according to AOAC (2002). Protein content of the samples was determined using an
automatic nitrogen analyzer (FP 528, LECO, Michigan, USA) based on the Dumas
method. Fat content was analyzed according to Flynn and Bramblet (1975).

        pH
        pH value of GE and chicken fresh sausages were measured in triplicate by using a
pH-meter (pH 3110 set 2, WTW, Weilheim, Germany) equipped with a glass
penetration probe.

        Emulsion stability
        Twenty-five gram of raw emulsion was centrifuged for 1 min at 2,634&#xD7;g. The
samples were heated in a water bath (70&#xB0;C, 30 min) than tubes were
centrifuged for 3 min at 2,634&#xD7;g. The pellets were removed and weighed
and the supernatants were separated into pre-weighed crucibles and dried at
100&#xB0;C. The volumes of total expressible fluid (TEF) and the expressible
fat (EFAT) were calculated according to Hughes
et al. (1997).

        Water holding capacity
        The ability of the uncooked product to keep moisture was assessed by using the
method stated by Hughes et al. (1997)
with modifications. Ten grams of batter was placed into jars and heated in
90&#xB0;C water bath (10 min), cooled and then samples were wrapped in roll
bandage. Wrapped samples were centrifuged at 323&#xD7;g for 15 min and weighed
again (W2). Water-holding capacity (WHC) was
calculated from the equation below:

        Where M indicate total moisture content of the sample.

        Jelly and fat separation
        Jelly and fat separation (JFS) of chicken fresh sausages were measured (Bloukas and Honikel., 1992). Raw emulsion
sample was placed in glass jars and heated in a boiling water bath for 35 min
(core temperature about 90&#xB0;C). After heat treatment, the jars were cooled
to room temperature and stored at 4&#xB0;C for 24 h. Jars were then re-heated
at 45&#xB0;C for 1 h. The fluid jelly and fat were drained in a volumetric
cylinder and measured in mL, JFS was calculated as a percentage of the original
weight of the emulsion.

        Cooking yield
        Cooking yields (CYs) of samples were conducted according to the Fang et al. (2019) with some modifications.
The weights of raw chicken fresh sausages were recorded, then sausages put into
the boiling water until the core temperature is reached 70&#xB0;C. Internal
temperature of sausages monitored by inserting a thermometer (Thermo TA-288,
Teknogreen, Sakarya, Turkey) into the sausages. After cooking, samples were
cooled and weighed again. The CY of samples was determined by calculating weight
differences for samples before and after cooking.

        Color
        Lightness (CIE L*), redness (CIE a*), and yellowness (CIE b*) parameters of GE
and cooked chicken fresh sausages were determined by using a portable
colorimeter (Chromameter CR400, Minolta, Tokyo, Japan).

        Purge loss
        Three bags per formulation were used to determine purge loss (PL) during chilled
storage. After the chicken fresh sausages were removed from the package, the
exudate was dried with paper towels and weighed again. The PL was calculated by
weight difference and expressed as a percentage of the initial weight.

        Peroxide value
        The peroxide value (PV) content of the samples was analyzed by the method of
Koniecko (1979). Ten grams of sample
was weighed and homogenized with 60 mL of chloroform for 2 min and filtered with
Whatman No. 1 and 25 mL of filtrate is added into 250 mL Erlenmeyer. Filtrates
were treated with 30 mL of glacial acetic acid and 2 mL of saturated potassium
iodide solution. Then, Erlenmeyers were stirred and kept closed for 5 min in the
dark. The flask was then added with 100 mL of distilled water and 2 mL of
1% fresh starch solution. Titration was carried out with 0.1 N sodium
thiosulfate and results were expressed in terms of per mEqO2
(milliequivalent peroxide oxygen)/kg.

        TBARS
        The 2-thiobarbituric acid reactive substances (TBARS) value was measured using
the method of Witte et al. (1970). Twenty
grams of sample was homogenized with 50 mL cold solution containing 20%
trichloroacetic acid (TCA) in 2 M phosphoric acid for 2 min 50 mL distilled
water was then added and homogenized again for 1 min. After that, the slurry was
filtered through Whatman No.1 filter paper into a 100 mL flask. The volume was
completed to 100 mL by 1:1 TCA: distilled water. 5 mL of the filtrate was then
pipetted into a test tube while another 5 mL of fresh chilled TBA (0.02 M in
distilled water) was added. The tubes were incubated at 80&#xB0;C for 35 min
and cooled to room temperature. The absorbance of the solution was measured with
a spectrophotometer (T-60, PG Instruments, Leicestershire, UK) at 532 nm against
blind solution prepared with 1:1 TCA-distilled water. The results were expressed
as TBARS values (mg malonaldehyde/kg sample), which was calculated by
multiplying the absorbance by 5.2. Each sample was analyzed in triplicate at
each storage time.

        Fatty acid composition
        Lipid extraction from samples was performed according to Flynn and Bramblet (1975) and methylated (IUPAC, 1992). Analyses of fatty acid methyl
esters (FAME) were carried out on a gas chromatograph (HP5890 Series,
Hewlett-Packard, Wilmington, USA). The fatty acids were identified by comparison
of their retention times of the sample with those of standards. Three
determinations were carried out per sample (silica capillary column: DB-23, 30
m&#xD7;0.25 mm id., 0.25 &#x3BC;m film thickness, 100&#xB0;C to
220&#xB0;C at 4&#xB0;C/min and 15 min at 220&#xB0;C., J.W. Scientific and
injector and detector (FID) temperature were kept at 220&#xB0;C, flow rate of
hydrogen 1 mL/min).

        Texture profile analysis
        Texture profile analyze (TPA) of cooked sausage samples was performed using a
texture analyzer (CT3-4500; Brookfield Engineering Laboratories, Middleborough,
MA, USA) with TA4/1,000 probe. Samples were cut into cylinders (20 mm
height&#xD7;19 mm diameter) and placed on the instrument&#x2019;s base (two
compression cycles, 4,500 g load cell, 40% compression, 1 mm/s crosshead
speed and 1 s time interval). Texture Expert version 1.0 software (Stable Micro
Systems, Surrey, UK) was used to collect and process the data.

        Statistical analysis
        All analysis was carried out in triplicate and one-way analysis of variance
(ANOVA) was applied in order to observe the statistical differences between the
chicken fresh sausages. Significant differences that have an effect on analysis
are further analyzed by Duncan multiple test at 95% confidence level by
using SPSS for Windows statistical package program (version 21.0, IBM, Armonk,
NY, USA).

      Results and Discussion

        pH, color (CIE L*, CIE a*, and CIE b*) and stability of gelled
emulsion
        O/W GEs are promising fat replacers in meat products thus their characteristics
play an important role in quality attributes associated with animal fat in final
products. pH, CIE L*, CIE a*, CIE b* and syneresis values of GE are measured as
6.35, 83.01, 3.88, 25.35, and 0.052%, respectively. pH value of GE is in
the range of previous studies recorded by Pintado et al. (2015) and de Souza
Paglarini et al. (2018). Similar to our study, Verheyen et al. (2018) found that pH value of GEs
containing sunflower oil, calcium carbonate, and glucono delta-lactone as
6.34.
        Serdaro&#x11F;lu et al. (2016) reported
that CIE L*, CIE a*, and CIE b* values of GE prepared with olive oil, inulin and
gelatin were 81.43, 3.71, and 15.98, respectively. CIE L*, CIE a*, and CIE b*
values of GE manufactured by using extra virgin olive oil and whey protein
isolate were determined as 84.96, &#x2013;0.51, and 12.91 (Freire et al., 2018).
        GE showed high emulsion stability against the centrifugation force and heat
treatment. Also, Pintado et al. (2015)
reported that GE prepared with olive oil and cold gelling agents showed no
noticeable syneresis or release. GE prepared with olive oil, inulin and gelatin
showed high thermal stability (93%) (Delgado-Pando et al., 2010) and using 3% carrageenan and
1% algae oil in GE formulation induced 1.14% syneresis (Alejandre et al., 2017).

        Chemical composition
        Chemical compositions of uncooked and cooked sausages are shown in Table 2 and Table 3. Moisture content of uncooked sausages changed between
66.41%&#x2013;69.47%. Moisture content increased with the addition
of GE (p&lt;0.05), this result was due to the high water content of GE.
Moisture content was significantly lower in the control than in the GE added
treatments. Pintado et al. (2015)
observed the same pattern in frankfurters added olive oil-in-water GE. There are
no significant differences in moisture content of cooked sausages except GE50.
GE50 samples showed the highest moisture content (p&lt;0.05), similar
findings reported by Poyato et al. (2014)
in Bologna type sausages where 50% animal fat was replaced with
conventional O/W emulsion or O/W GE.

        Fat content was decreased with the GE addition both in raw and cooked samples
(p&lt;0.05). Fat content of GE50 was found lower than other counterparts
with respect to increment in moisture content. GE addition affected protein
content of raw samples, GE75 and GE100 samples had higher protein content than
control and GE50 (p&lt;0.05), this finding could be explained by using SC as
an emulsifying agent in the GE. The protein content of the cooked samples did
not change significantly with the addition of GE. Serdaro&#x11F;lu et al. (2017) also reported no
significant differences in protein content of raw chicken patties formulated
with GEs however in cooked samples except 100% replaced samples.
        While GE75 had the highest ash content among the raw samples, no significant
differences were found in the ash content of cooked ones. Alejandre et al. (2016) also found that incorporating
linseed oil GEs as fat replacer up to 39.5% did not affect the ash
contents of dry fermented sausage samples.
        pH values of GE added fresh sausages were found lower than C on final product
(p&lt;0.05), cooked sausage samples present no significant differences.
Opposite to our findings, pH increasing effect of GEs is reported by Pintado et al. (2018) in fresh
sausages.

        Water holding capacity (WHC), jelly and fat separation (JFS), cooking yield
(CY) and emulsion stability (TEF, EFAT)
        Technological properties of meat emulsions such as CY, emulsion stability, and
water holding capacity are some of the most important factors for the food
industry to predict the behavior of products during cooking. The technological
properties of fresh sausages could be seen in Table 3. It can be recognized that GE addition resulted in a
decrement in WHC of samples when the replacement level was more than 50%
(p&lt;0.05). This could be explained by the addition of more than 50%
GE induces dilution of meat proteins which are capable of hold the water in meat
system.
        JFS is a parameter that shows the ability of meat products to keep its moisture
and fat. JFS of fresh sausages were affected by the addition of GE
(p&lt;0.05). GE added samples had higher values than C sample
(p&lt;0.05). The highest levels of JFS recorded in GE75 samples, while GE50
and GE100 had similar values.
        In proportion to JFS values, the highest TEF and EFAT were observed in GE75
samples (p&lt;0.05). The lowest fluid release was obtained in C samples,
however, fat releases of C, GE50, and GE100 were similar. It could be evaluated
as GE75 samples had the lowest emulsion stability between the treatments while C
and GE100 had the highest emulsion stability. The reason for decrement in
emulsion stability could be explained by the type of fat or ratio of protein in
sausage formulation. Due to the low melting point, utilizing unsaturated fatty
acids in products can cause a decrease in emulsion stability values.
        The highest CYs were observed in C samples, this finding could be explained by
the low meat protein content of GE added samples, since CY depends on the
ability of the protein matrix to stabilize both fat and water molecules. GE75
samples had the lowest CY (p&lt;0.05), which would likely be the result of
the blocking effect of GE on the water binding ability of meat proteins. When
gelatin is used at an appropriate concentration in meat emulsions, it acts as a
stabilizer; promotes CY, reduces fat and water losses due to its gelling ability
(Serdaro&#x11F;lu et al., 2017).
However, increasing gelatin concentration resulted in a decrement in CY since
gelatin might be melted out and could not interact with the protein in MSME
treatments during cooking (Serdaro&#x11F;lu et
al., 2017). Similar to our results, Serdaro&#x11F;lu et al. (2016) indicated that replacing beef fat
completely with GE can have negative impacts on the JFS, CY, and WHC. In
contrast to our results, meat emulsion formulated with perilla-canola oil (O/W)
GE showed better emulsion stability, CY than control samples (Utama et al., 2018).

        Color
        The color of the meat product is one of the important parameters that the
consumer can predict the quality during the purchasing. The color parameters of
the samples could be seen in Fig. 2. The
addition of GE significantly affected Lightness (CIE L*), redness (CIE a*), and
yellowness (CIE b*) values of samples due to the color of flaxseed and black
cumin oils in formulation. On 0th d and throughout the storage GE
added samples showed darker color than C samples. Increasing GE levels more than
50% decreased CIE L* values of the final product (p&lt;0.05). GE
addition induced CIE L* values to decrease in all formulations during 5 d of
storage (p&lt;0.05).

        CIE a* values were measured 3.19, 3.76, 3.28, 3.99, and CIE b* values were
measured 18.60, 18.84, 16.68, and 18.07 for C, GE50, GE75, and GE100
respectively. During the storage, CIE a* values of all samples were increased,
while CIE b* values of all samples were decreased. These changes can be
explained by the lipid oxidation during the storage. Besides, this noticeable
decrement in CIE b* values can be attributed to the isomerization and potential
degradation of carotenoids in black cumin oil (Zepka et al., 2009). Similar to our results, Pintado et al. (2016) reported that storage period had an
increasing effect on CIE a* values while decreasing effect on CIE b* values.
        Poyato et al. (2014) reported that CIE L*,
CIE a*, and CIE b* were significantly higher in GE prepared with linseed oil and
carrageenan added products compared to control samples. Gel emulsion containing
microalgal oil and a branch extract did not influence the CIE L*, CIE a*, and
CIE b* parameters of beef patties (Alejandre et
al., 2019).

        Purge loss
        PL in packaged meat products affects the appearance of the product negatively and
also limits the shelf life of the product by making it more vulnerable to
microbiological deterioration (L&#xF3;pez-L&#xF3;pez et al., 2009). PLs of fresh sausages
formulated with different levels of GE are presented in Fig. 3. GE addition did not alter the PL, during the storage
PL of samples increased significantly except GE50 (p&lt;0.05). Similar to
our results Salcedo-Sandoval et al.
(2015) reported that PLs of frankfurters formulated with liquid fish
oil, fish oil/water emulsion and fish oil filled hydrogel particles are ranged
between 0.13%&#x2013;0.58% control and samples formulated with
hydrogel particles had similar PLs.

        Peroxide value
        Autoxidation is a reaction between unsaturated fatty acids, regardless of whether
they are in their free state or esterified as a triglyceride molecule and
oxygen. These reactions originate from hydroperoxides, which are rapidly turn to
aldehydes, ketones, alcohols, hydrocarbons, esters, furans and lactones (Almeida et al., 2019). PVs of fresh sausages
could be seen in Fig. 4. Initial PVs were
similar in C, GE50, GE75, however, GE100 samples had lower PVs than other
experimental counterparts (p&lt;0.05). Since black cumin and flaxseed are
highly perishable oils, GE100 samples which have high amount of these oils also
showed high initial TBARS values (Fig. 5).
PVs of final products were higher than the values on the 3rd d of
storage except for GE100 (p&lt;0.05). This decrement might be the result of
transformation of lipid peroxides to further lipid or protein oxidation products
(Aalhus and Dugan, 2004).

substances.

        On 5th d only GE75 and GE100 samples were higher than the PVs of the
3rd d (p&lt;0.05). The highest PVs were seen in GE75 at the
end of the storage (p&lt;0.05). Higher PVs than control samples also
reported by Pelser et al. (2007) in Dutch
style fermented sausages formulated with flaxseed oil or flaxseed oil
pre-emulsified with SC. However, Alejandre et al.
(2016) indicated that replacing pork fat at a level of 39.5%
with linseed GE did not affect the PV of dry fermented sausage samples.

        TBARS
        Meat products are exposed to oxidation by the action of metal ions, unsaturated
fatty acids, and reactive oxygen species. The toxic compounds formed as a result
of lipid oxidation induce discoloration, poor taste, loss of nutritional value
and reduction of shelf life in meat products. Changes in TBARS values of fresh
sausages during the storage are given in Fig.
5. Initial TBARS values of sausages were between 0.58&#x2013;1.26 mg
malonaldehyde/kg. The highest TBARS value was found in GE100 sample while GE50
had the lowest value at d 0 (p&lt;0.05). These results could be associated
with the highest unsaturated fatty acid contents of GE100 samples. TBARS
increasing effect of vegetable oils also declared by Choi et al. (2010) in reduced fat frankfurters formulated
with 10% pre-emulsified olive, grape seed, corn, canola and soybean oils
in combination with 10% pork back fat and 2% rice bran.
        TBARS values of fresh sausages changed between 0.29&#x2013;1.43 mg
malonaldehyde/kg. No significant changes were observed in TBARS values of
treated counterparts until 5th d. Throughout the storage, when the
PVs decreased, TBARS values were increased, however, no significant differences
were obtained except GE50 sample. GE50 samples showed a decrement on the
5th d and also showed the lowest TBARS values at the end of the
storage (p&lt;0.05). These results are thought to be caused by antioxidant
compounds found in black cumin and/or flaxseed oil. Thymoquinone and flavonoids
are the main antioxidants in black cumin and flaxseed oils respectively (Lutterodt et al., 2010; Wang et al., 2017). At the end of the
storage TBARS values of all samples were lower than 2 mg malonaldehyde/kg which
is a limit declared by Witte et al.
(1970). It could be said that replacing beef fat with GE is a
suitable application in terms of oxidative quality of short period stored fresh
chicken sausages.
        Increases in TBARS values throughout the storage could be explained greater
formation ratio of malonaldehyde than the disappearance, however after a point
the ratio of disappearance pass the ratio of formation then TBARS values
decrease (Delgado-Pando et al., 2011).
Changes in TBARS values could also derive as a result of intermolecular
reactions of malonaldehydes with amino acids or proteins. Therefore, the rate of
malonaldehyde loss/disappearance during storage may have exceeded the rate of
production through lipid oxidation (Jamora and
Rhee, 2002).
        Similar to our results, replacing 50% of pork back fat with avocado,
sunflower and olive oils in pork patties resulted in lower TBARS values than
patties added 100% of pork back fat due to antioxidant substances present
in avocado, sunflower and olive oils (Rodr&#xED;guez-Carpena et al., 2012). Dutch-style fermented
sausages reformulated with encapsulated fish oil had lower quantity of lipid
oxidation products than control samples and pure fish oil added samples (Josquin et al., 2012).

        Fatty acid composition
        While black cumin oil contains 58.5% linoleic acid, 23.8% oleic
acid, total unsaturated fatty acid content of this oil is 82.9% (Gharby et al., 2015) and flaxseed oil is
rich in linolenic acid 55% (Dubois et
al., 2007). Fatty acid composition of samples was given in Table 4. The addition amount of GE affected
the fatty acid composition of sausages. Increasing addition level of GE resulted
and increment in PUFA content of sausages (p&lt;0.05). The same trend was
also reported by Delgado-Pando et al.
(2010) in low fat frankfurters added olive, linseed and fish oil
mixture-in-water emulsions and de Souza
Paglarini et al. (2019b) in frankfurters formulated with GE prepared
with soybean oil, soy protein isolate, carrageenan and inulin. Major Saturated
fatty acid (SFAs) were C16:0 (palmitic acid) and C18:0 (stearic acid), the major
unsaturated fatty acids were C18:1 (oleic acid), C18:2 (linoleic acid) in
samples prepared with 100% of beef fat. Likewise, Asuming-Bediako et al. (2014) found that major SFAs were
C16:0 (palmitic acid) and C18:0 (stearic acid) and major unsaturated fatty acids
were C18:1 (oleic acid), C18:2 (linoleic acid) in UK-style sausages formulated
with pre-emulsified pork fat.

        Replacing beef fat with GE had a reducing effect on the SFA content of fresh
sausages (p&lt;0.05). The reduction percentage of SFA was 18.80%,
28.94%, and 52.61% for GE50, GE75, and GE100 respectively. The
reduction in the saturated fat content in GE75 and GE100 samples can confers to
the attribute of &#x201C;reduced in saturated fat&#x201D; product, as they
reached a reduction of more than 25% for American rules and more than
30% for European Commission (de Souza
Paglarini et al., 2019b). Decreases in saturated fat content are
originated from the addition of healthier oil combination which contained high
amount of unsaturated fatty acid instead of animal fat is in the
formulation.
        GE100 sample registered the highest C18:1+C18:2 (oleic
acid+linoleic acid) content while the lowest C18:1+C18:2 (oleic
acid+linoleic acid) content were observed in control samples
(p&lt;0.05). These findings could be supported by the fatty acid composition
of black cumin and flaxseed oil mixture. Due to the fatty acid composition of
both oils, healthier combination of these oils constituted high amount of oleic
acid and linoleic acid together with linolenic acid. In general, integrating GE
prepared with these oils to formulation enabled healthier meat products with
high percentage of unsaturated fatty acids.

        Texture profile analysis
        The results of texture profile analysis are given in Table 5. Using GE prepared with flaxseed and black cumin
oils as beef fat replacer in fresh sausage formulation altered the texture
profile properties (p&lt;0.05). All reformulated fresh sausage samples
showed a softer texture compared to control prepared with 100% of beef
fat. GE75 and GE100 samples had similar hardness values, also both groups showed
the lowest hardness values among the samples (p&lt;0.05). The reason for the
lowest hardness values could be related to fat reduction process. While the
source of protein (chicken meat) kept constant, fat content of the system was
decreased, and the amount of water increased along with GE addition thus,
texture became less dense (Jim&#xE9;nez-Colmenero et al., 1996). Gumminess and chewiness
results were in parallel with each other. C and GE50 samples had the highest
gumminess and chewiness while lower values were found in GE75 and GE100
(p&lt;0.05).

        Similar to our results Andr&#xE9;s et al.
(2009) observed lower hardness and chewiness values in chicken
sausages formulated with squid oil than sausages formulated with beef tallow.
Also reformulating fresh sausages with chia added olive oil emulsion gel
resulted softer products (Pintado et al.,
2018), however, the different behavior has been reported in emulsion
sausages formulated with 100% canola oil (Baek et al., 2016).

      Conclusion
      The result of this study demonstrated that incorporating GE into the fresh sausage
formulation showed a decreasing effect on the fat content of sausages. Higher beef
fat replacement ratio than 50% lowered the water holding capacity. Increasing
the use of GE resulted in darker sausages most probably as a result of pigments in
black cumin oil. From the oxidation perspective, even sample formulated with
100% GE was found acceptable. The use of GE leads to the way production of
reduced fat meat products with more than 50% of reduction in SFA content.
Major unsaturated fatty acids of fresh chicken sausages were oleic
acid+linoleic acids. Further studies can be done to determine the effects of
GE on functional, technological and also sensory properties of different meat
products such as emulsion type meatballs and nuggets.
