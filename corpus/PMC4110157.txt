Banana Xanthomonas wilt (BXW), caused by the bacterium Xanthomonas campestris pv. musacearum (Xcm), is the most devastating disease of banana in east and central Africa. The spread of BXW threatens the livelihood of millions of African farmers who depend on banana for food security and income. There are no commercial chemicals, bio-control agents or resistant cultivars available to control BXW. Here we take advantage of the robust resistance conferred by the rice pattern recognition receptor (PRR), XA21, to the rice pathogen Xanthomonas oryzae pv. oryzae (Xoo). We identified a set of genes required for activation of Xa21 mediated immunity (rax) that were conserved in both Xoo and Xcm. Based on the conservation, we hypothesized that intergeneric transfer of Xa21 would confer resistance to Xcm. We evaluated 25 transgenic lines of the banana cultivar ‘Gonja manjaya’ (AAB) using a rapid bioassay and 12 transgenic plants in the glass house for resistance against Xcm. About fifty percent of the transgenic lines showed complete resistance to Xcm in both assays. In contrast, all of the non-transgenic control plants showed severe symptoms that progressed to complete wilting. These results indicate that the constitutive expression of the rice Xa21 gene in banana results in enhanced resistance against Xcm. Furthermore this work demonstrates the feasibility of PRR gene transfer between monocotyledonous species and provides a valuable new tool for controlling the BXW pandemic of banana, a staple food for 100 million people in east Africa.

   Introduction
Banana and plantain (Musa sp.) is the eighth most important staple food crop in the tropics and subtropics, grown in more than 120 countries with an annual world production of around 133 million tons (FAOSTAT, 2011). Approximately one third of global Musa production is from Africa, of which more than 50% is produced in the East African Great Lakes region including Burundi, Rwanda, Democratic Republic of Congo, Uganda, Kenya and Tanzania (FAOSTAT, 2011). The banana production, however, is affected by several diseases and pests, such as black Sigatoka, Fusarium wilt, banana Xanthomonas wilt (BXW), viruses such as Banana bunchy-top virus (BBTV) and Banana streak virus (BSV), weevils and nematodes (Jones, 2000; Tushemereirwe et al., 2004).

BXW caused by Xanthomonas campestris pv. musacearum (Xcm), is one of the most important diseases of banana, and is considered the biggest threat to banana production in the Great Lakes region of east and central Africa (Tripathi et al., 2009). BXW was first reported in Ethiopia in Ensete species and then on banana (Yirgou and Bradbury, 1968, 1974). Outside Ethiopia, BXW was first identified in Uganda in 2001 (Tushemereirwe et al., 2004) and subsequently in the Democratic Republic of Congo (Ndungo et al., 2005), Rwanda (Reeder et al., 2007), Kenya, Tanzania and Burundi (Carter et al., 2009). There are no commercial chemicals, bio-control agents or resistant cultivars available to control BXW (Tripathi et al., 2009). The disease can, however, be managed by following cultural practices such as the cutting and burying of infected plants, restricting the movement of banana planting materials from BXW affected to disease free areas, removal of male buds and the use of sterilized tools. The adoption of such practices has been inconsistent as they are very labour intensive. The lack of known genetic resistance in banana against Xcm, the difficulties associated with conventional breeding of this highly sterile crop, and a dependence on labor intensive, favor a transgenic approach to control BXW.

For the last 100 years, a considerable effort has been directed at introducing genes conferring resistance to a variety of bacterial, fungal and viral diseases through conventional breeding approaches. In the 1990s, many of these disease resistance genes were isolated and characterized. These studies identified two distinct classes of receptors. The first class includes “race specific” receptors that have long been used in breeding programs. These race specific receptors typically fall into the “NBS-LRR” class and recognize specific races of the pathogen. Resistance conferred by race specific receptors is frequently ephemeral because the pathogen can evolve mechanisms to overcome the resistance. In contrast, the second class of immune receptors, the pattern recognition receptors (PRRs), confers broad-spectrum resistance that is predicted to be durable. This is because these immune receptors recognize conserved microbial products that are essential to pathogen fitness. In this case, if the microbe mutates these critical components, the microbe is impaired in virulence.

The discovery of PRRs and NBS-LRR receptors presents opportunities to transfer immune receptors and chimeric receptors across genera using genetic engineering. For example, the tomato race specific Pto gene was introduced in transgenic tobacco to enhance resistance to Pseudomonas syringae pv. tabaci (Thilmony et al., 1995). Similarly, the pepper race specific Bs2 gene was shown to confer resistance to bacterial spot disease when transferred to tomato (Tai et al., 1999). The maize NBS-LRR, Rxo, was transferred to rice (Zhao et al., 2005).

Over 300 immune receptors of the PRR class have been predicted in rice and 35 in Arabidopsis (Dardick et al., 2006). However, despite their importance and abundance in plant genomes, only a few plant PRRs have been isolated and characterized (Lacombe et al., 2010). Even fewer have been tested for their ability to confer resistance when transferred from one plant species to another. An important example is the transfer of the Arabidopsis EF-Tu (elongation factor thermo unstable) receptor (EFR) to other dicotyledonous genera (Zipfel et al., 2004; Lacombe et al., 2010). EFR recognizes the conserved bacterial molecule EF-Tu (or its eliciting epitope elf18). In plants, perception of EF-Tu seems to be restricted to the order Brassicales. Transgenic expression of EFR in the solanaceous species Nicotiana benthamiana and Solanum lycopersicum confers responsiveness to EF-Tu and makes the plants more resistant to a range of phytopathogenic bacteria from different genera (Lacombe et al., 2010). Other PRRs have also been successfully transferred to taxonomically diverse plant species (Mendes et al., 2010; Afros et al., 2011). The demonstration that PRRs can be transferred between species opens the possibility of engineering resistance to devastating diseases of monocots, which provide the staple food for 80% of the world’s people.

The rice XA21 pattern recognition receptor, confers broad-spectrum resistance to the Gram-negative bacterium, Xanthomonas oryzae pv. oryzae (Xoo). The Xa21 was identified in the wild rice species Oryza longistaminata (Ikeda et al., 1990; Ronald et al., 1992) and confers broad-spectrum resistance to the most races of Xoo, the causal agent of bacterial blight of rice (Ronald et al., 1992, Wang et al., 1996). Engineered chimeric XA21 receptors confer resistance to a serious fungal pathogen when introduced into normally susceptible rice varieties (Kishimoto et al., 2010).

In the past several years, genetic analysis led to the identification of ten Xoo genes, which are required for activation of Xa21-mediated immunity, that fall into three functional classes. The first class consists of 3 genes (raxA, raxB and raxC) that encode components of a putative bacterial Type I secretion system (da Silva et al., 2004). The second class includes raxP and raxQ, which encode an adenosine-5′-triphosphate (ATP) sulfurylase and adenosine-5′-phosphosulfate kinase. These proteins function in concert to produce 3′-phosphoadenosine 5′-phosphosulfate (Shen et al., 2002), the universal sulfuryl group donor. This class also includes raxST, which encodes a tyrosyl-sulfotransferase (Han et al., 2012). The third class includes four genes encoding two-component regulatory systems: the RaxR/H system (Burdman et al., 2004) and the PhoP/Q system (Lee et al., 2008). RaxR/H negatively regulates PhoP, which governs virulence by control of hrp gene expression (Lee et al., 2008). We found that all three functional classes are present in the recently sequenced Xcm genome (Studholme et al., 2011). These results suggest that Xa21 receptors may recognize a microbial determinant that is conserved in Xcm. In this study, we tested this prediction by expressing the rice Xa21 gene in transgenic banana and assaying for resistance against Xcm.

Results
RaxSTAB analysis
The Xoo raxSTAB operon is required for elicitation of Xa21-mediated immunity in rice. We hypothesized that XA21 recognizes a molecule that is secreted and/or modified by the raxSTAB operon. In this case, Xanthomonas strains that carry raxSTAB, or close orthologs, would no longer be able to infect XA21 plants. To gain insight into the genome of Xcm and to better predict the function of the XA21 receptor in banana, we carried out a comparative genomic analysis of the raxSTAB operon in 7 sequenced Xanthomonas strains: Xcm, Xoo_PXO99, Xoo_MAFF, X. oryzae pv. oryzicola (Xoc), X. axonopodis pv. citrumelo F1 (Xac), X. euvesicatoria 85-10, and X. translucens (Fig. S1).

We found that Xcm also carries the raxSTAB operon, and that it shares high sequence similarity with the predicted orthologous operon in Xoo and other Xanthomonas species (Fig. S1). Specifically Xcm and Xoo_PXO99 share 91, 85 and 92% sequence identity for RaxST, RaxA and RaxB, respectively. A detailed alignment of these proteins is presented in Fig. S2 (supplementary information). Based on the conservation, we hypothesized that intergeneric transfer of Xa21 would confer resistance to Xcm.

Generation and validation of transgenic plants
Banana embryogenic cell suspension (ECS) cultures were successfully transformed with A. tumefaciens strain EHA105 containing the pCAMBIA1300-Ubi:Xa21 plasmid vector in which the Xa21 gene was expressed under control of the maize Ubiquitin constitutive promoter. The transformed cells multiplied and proliferated on hygromycin selective medium, whereas untransformed cells turned black (Fig. 1). The embryogenic cells were regenerated on selective medium and approximately 30–40 transgenic plants were regenerated from 0.5 ml settle cell volume of cell suspension on selective media supplemented with hygromycin. In total 95 independent putative transgenic lines were obtained in three experiments. The regenerated independent transgenic shoots were clonally multiplied and transferred to rooting medium. All shoots developed roots within three to four weeks. The well rooted plantlets of the independent transgenic lines were transferred to pots in the contained glasshouse for disease evaluation and growth analysis (Fig. 1).

The presence of the Xa21 gene was confirmed in all the 95 putative transgenic lines by PCR using Xa21 specific primers. The amplified product of 410 bp was observed from the genomic DNA of all transgenic plants, confirming the presence of the transgene in all the transgenic lines tested (Fig. 2b). An amplified fragment of 415 bp was observed for all tested transgenic plants using the hygromycin phosphotransferase (hpt) specific primers (Fig. 2b). This confirmed the presence of both Xa21 and hpt genes in all the transgenic lines tested. Twenty five lines were prioritized for further evaluation.

Evaluation of transgenic lines for disease resistance using rapid bioassay
Small in vitro plantlets were inoculated with Xcm using rapid bioassay, and the resistance responses were categorized into three categories: resistant, partially resistant and susceptible (Fig. 3, Table 1). The non-transgenic control plantlets developed symptoms (chlorosis, necrosis and wilting) at about 8 days post inoculation (dpi) and were completely wilted by 20 dpi (Fig. 3a). Out of 25 transgenic lines tested, 12 lines did not show any symptoms up to 60 dpi and were classified as resistant lines (Fig. 3b–d, Table 1). Four transgenic lines showed symptoms in the inoculated leaf, but these did not spread to other leaves and plants were never completely wilted, confirming partial resistance. The remaining nine lines showed symptoms and completely wilted within 30 dpi, similar to the control non-transgenic plants. These lines were classified as susceptible transgenic lines.

The pathogenic bacteria re-isolated from wilted plants were identified as Xcm on the basis of their characteristic morphology (yellowish, mucoid and circular colonies) (Tripathi et al., 2007). Their identity was further confirmed by PCR using Xcm specific primers (Adikini et al., 2011).

Evaluation of transgenic lines for resistance to BXW in glasshouse using potted plants
The 12 transgenic lines (GX3, GX5, GX8, GX15, GX26, GX36, GX37, GX46, GX57, GX62, GX74 and GX76), previously subjected to the rapid screening assay, were selected for further screening using potted plants in a glasshouse (Fig. 3; Table 2). Three plantlets of each transgenic line were grown and artificially inoculated with Xcm. The non-transgenic control plants developed symptoms after about 16–18 dpi and completely wilted 39 dpi (Fig. 3e). Out of the 12 transgenic lines tested, three lines (GX37, GX62 and GX74) showed symptoms such as drooping of inoculated leaves, which then turned-yellowish brown and symptoms spread to other leaves and finally plants completely wilted in 41–45 dpi. These lines were also found to be susceptible when tested using the rapid bioassay. Seven transgenic lines (GX3, GX5, GX8, GX15, GX26, GX46 and GX76) showed no symptoms at all, not even in inoculated leaves up to 60 dpi, indicating that they were completely resistant against Xcm (Table 2, Fig. 3f–h). These 7 lines were also found to be resistant in the rapid bioassay. The remaining two lines (GX36 and GX57) were found to be partial resistance with disease symptoms in only two to three leaves and these plants were only partially wilted at 60 dpi.

No internal symptom (yellow ooze) was observed in asymptomatic transgenic plants where as yellow ooze due to growth of Xcm was observed in inoculated non-transgenic plants and symptomatic transgenic plants (Fig. 3i–k).

Bacterial population analysis in transgenic and non-transgenic plants
Two transgenic lines (GX8 and GX26) along with non-transgenic plants were further evaluated for growth of bacterial populations. The bacteria isolated from inoculated transgenic lines at 0 dpi were similar to those obtained from non-transgenic plants (Fig. 4a). Over time, the bacterial population significantly (P &lt; 0.05) decreased to 3.72 log cfu/cm2 in transgenic line GX8 and 2.53 log cfu/cm2 in transgenic line GX26 in comparison to inoculated non-transgenic banana, where the bacterial population reached 6.7 log cfu/cm2 at 16 dpi. These results demonstrated that populations of Xcm were much lower in leaves of resistant transgenic lines than in those of the non-transgenic control plants. No bacteria were recovered 5 cm above and 5cm below the inoculation point in leaves of transgenic line GX8 confirming that bacteria was contained in the transgenic plants (Fig. 4b). However, slight bacterial growth was observed in transgenic line GX26 at 5 cm below the inoculation point although no bacteria were found at above the inoculation point.

Molecular characterization of transgenic lines
Genomic DNA of all the twelve transgenic lines (GX3, GX5, GX8, GX15, GX26, GX36, GX37, GX46, GX57, GX62, GX74 and GX76) evaluated for disease resistance in the glasshouse were confirmed to contain the Xa21 gene by Southern blot analysis (Figure S3, supplementary information). Their unique hybridization patterns further indicated that each transgenic line resulted from an independent transformation event.

The same twelve transgenic lines were further analyzed for expression levels of the Xa21 gene by RT-PCR and qRT-PCR using gene-specific primers. The amplified Xa21 transcript of 110 bp was observed in all the transgenic lines tested (Fig. 5a) confirming expression of transgene in all the tested lines.

The 25S ribosomal transcripts amplification of the internal control was also detected in all the plants tested. To evaluate Xa21 transcripts, we then performed qRT-PCR, which clearly showed that Xa21 transcript level varied among the different transgenic lines (Fig. 5b). In four of the transgenic lines (GX3, GX5, GX8, and GX76), Xa21 transcript levels correlated with disease resistance (i.e. the lines with high transcript levels were also highly resistant against Xcm). However, some lines did not show any correlation between transcript level and disease resistance. For example, lines GX15, GX26 and GX46 had relatively low Xa21 transcript level, and yet showed 100% resistance against Xcm (Table 2). The five transgenic lines that were susceptible or partial resistance also contained varying levels of Xa21 transcripts. No transcripts were found in the RNA isolated from non-transgenic plants.

Growth analysis of transgenic plants
The 12 transgenic lines (GX3, GX5, GX8, GX12, GX15, GX26, GX29, GX32, GX37, GX60, GX62, and GX76) evaluated for growth analysis showed no phenotypic differences when compared to the non-transgenic control plants (Fig. 6). A few transgenic lines were taller with larger leaf area than non-transgenic control plants, but these traits were not statistically significantly different from the non-transgenic control plants.

Discussion
Genetic engineering (GE) has proven to be a useful technology for incorporating beneficial traits into diverse plant species and offers a method to overcome bottlenecks associated with classical breeding. The GE crops currently on the market (primarily cotton, maize, canola and soybean) have been widely adopted by farmers; 170 million hectares, approximately 12% of the global arable land, were planted by GE crops in 2012 (Qaim and Kouser, 2013). Genetic engineering of staple food crops, such as banana and rice, for resistance to diseases, pests and abiotic stresses, is expected to substantially alleviate poverty, hunger and malnutrition (Demont and Stein, 2013). In the case of banana, a staple food for about 100 million people in Africa, genetic engineering provides a new tool to limit the spread of pathogens that are difficult to control using current conventional methods, such as Xcm (Tripathi et al., 2009).

In farmers’ fields, BXW can be contained if de-budding is effectively practiced. However, adoption of de-budding has been inconsistent among farming communities (Kagezi et al., 2006). Once BXW occurs in a field, there is no remedy other than to cut down all infected plants, completely dig out the rhizomes and place the field under fallow or a prolonged crop rotation regime. A 6-month fallow period is adequate to avoid re-infection from soil-borne inoculum if all infected plant material is removed (Tripathi et al., 2009). The generation and growth of resistant cultivars is a cost-effective approach for managing bacterial diseases. However, resistance to Xcm has not yet been identified in studies of diverse banana germplasm. Even if resistant germplasm sources are identified, conventional breeding of banana is a difficult and lengthy process due to sterility of the most cultivars coupled with long generation times. Transgenic technologies present a cost-effective alternative approach for developing strategies to control the BXW pandemic.

The rice Xa21 gene was considered a good candidate for engineering transgenic resistance to Xcm because of its broad-spectrum resistance against Xoo (Song et al., 1995; Wang et al., 1996). We and others previously demonstrated that the Xa21 gene is effective in controlling resistance to diverse isolates of Xoo when expressed in susceptible rice cultivars (Wang et al., 1996), and provides protection against a range of the bacterial pathogens in transgenic citrus and tomato (Mendes et al., 2010; Afros et al., 2011). Here, we show that the Xoo raxSTAB operon, which is required for the activation of Xa21-mediated immunity, is highly conserved in diverse Xanthomonas species, including Xcm and that the Xa21 gene confers resistance to Xcm.

In the current study, 25 independent transgenic banana plants of the cultivar ‘Gonja manjaya’ (AAB) expressing the rice Xa21 PRR were evaluated for resistance against Xcm using rapid bioassay. Twelve of these in vitro plantlets showed resistance against Xcm. In contrast, all of the non-transgenic control in vitro plantlets showed severe symptoms that progressed to complete wilting. The advantage of the initial in vitro plantlets screening is that the response of the transgenic plantlets to Xcm can be determined within six weeks. This is very efficient especially in instances where large numbers of transgenic lines have to be screened because highly susceptible lines can be quickly identified and eliminated from further study (Tripathi et al., 2008). We further evaluated the 12 transgenic lines for resistance to Xcm in the glass house using 90 days-old potted plants. The 12 transgenic lines screened in the glasshouse conferred varying levels of resistance to Xcm, with 58% lines showing complete resistance.

The level of Xa21 transcripts varied among the 12 transgenic lines, and the level of expression did not correlate with the level of the observed disease resistance. All the 12 lines tested expressed the transgene, even the susceptible lines. These results suggest that the observed variation in disease resistance is not due to transcript accumulation.

The transgenic plants displayed no measureable morphological differences (plant height, total leaf area and pseudostem thickness) compared with non-transgenic control plants in glasshouse house conditions. These results indicate that the constitutive expression of the rice Xa21 gene in banana results in enhanced resistance to Xcm with no visible physiological effects.

It is well known that pathogens can evolve and “breakdown” genetic resistance. Today, knowledge of resistance gene structure and function and the ability to sequence diverse pathogen strains provides a new opportunity to engineer plants for resistance and to predict their potential usefulness and durability. It has been hypothesized that resistance conferred by race specific receptors is not durable because the pathogen can quickly evolve mechanisms to overcome the resistance. In contrast, some PRRs confer broad-spectrum, durable, resistance. For example, the introduction of the stem rust-resistance gene (RPG1, a predicted PRR) into barley in the mid 1940’s, has conferred durable and broad-spectrum resistance to many isolates of the stem rust pathogen Puccinia graminis f. sp. tritici (Brueggeman et al., 2002). Preliminary results similarly suggest that Xa21 may confer durable resistance in rice (Choi et al., 2003). This may be due to the recognition of a conserve microbial determinant (also known as pathogen associated molecular pattern (PAMP) that is essential to pathogen fitness. In this case, the microbe cannot easily overcome the plants resistance through mutation. Still, because it is known that PRR-mediated immunity can be overcome through suppression of the immune response by bacterial effectors (Dodds and Rathjen, 2010), it is not possible to predict if the observed Xa21-mediated resistance to Xcm will be durable. To enhance the durability of resistance, breeders have often used a stacking approach, where diverse resistance genes are combined into a single line (Zhu et al., 2012). The data from this study suggest that Xa21 could be used in combination of other resistance genes such as Hrap and/or Pflp, which showed enhanced resistance against Xcm in previous reports (Tripathi et al., 2010; 2013; Namukwaya et al., 2012).

The selected XA21 transgenic lines will be further evaluated for field resistance, agronomic traits and fruit quality. If proven valuable under field conditions in east and central African countries, XA21-banana will be an important tool in the battle against bacterial wilt epidemics and improve the livelihoods of more than 100 million people in Africa.

Experimental Procedures
RaxSTAB analysis
The amino acid sequence of RaxST, RaxA and RaxB of different Xanthomonas species, as detailed in Fig. S1 (supplementary information), were aligned using the ClustalW2 alignment tool (Larkin et al. 2007). Identity scores were calculated as the number of identities between two sequences, divided by the length of the alignment, and represented as a percentage.

Plasmid construct and banana transformation
The binary vector pCAMBIA1300-Ubi:Xa21 containing the rice Xa21 gene driven by a maize ubiquitin promoter, and hygromycin phosphotransferase (hpt) as selection marker was used in all the genetic transformation experiments (Fig. 2a) (Park et al., 2010). The plasmid vector was transformed into an Agrobacterium tumefaciens super virulent strain EHA 105 (Hood et al., 1993) through electroporation. Thereafter, EHA 105 harboring pCAMBIA1300-Ubi:Xa21 was prepared for banana transformation as described previously by Tripathi et al. (2012).

ECSs of the banana cultivar ‘Gonja manjaya’ were transformed with Agrobacterium strain EHA 105 harboring pCAMBIA1300-Ubi:Xa21 using the procedure described by Tripathi et al. (2012). The Agrobacterium-infected ECSs were then cultured on selective embryo development medium (EDM; Tripathi et al., 2012) supplemented with cefotaxime (300 mg/L) and hygromycin (25 mg/L) for two to three months, and transferred every two weeks to fresh medium of the same type. Putatively transformed embryos that developed on EDM were transferred to selective embryo maturation medium (EMM; Tripathi et al., 2012) supplemented with cefotaxime (300 mg/L) and hygromycin (25 mg/L). When mature embryos developed, they were transferred to selective germination medium (GM; Tripathi et al., 2012) supplemented with cefotaxime (300 mg/L) and hygromycin (25 mg/L). Shoots developing on GM were transferred to proliferation medium (PM; Tripathi et al., 2012) and kept at 28°C for a 16 h/8 h light/dark photoperiod under fluorescent tube lights for maintenance and multiplication of shoots. Regenerated putative transgenic shoots were transferred to rooting medium (RM; Tripathi et al., 2012). Rooted plantlets were planted in sterile soil in pots and maintained in a containment facility (Fig. 1). Regenerated putative transgenic shoots were regularly micro-propagated and clonally multiplied to obtain 12 plantlets of each line for rapid bioassay, glasshouse screening, growth analysis and safekeeping in growth room for molecular analysis.

Genomic DNA isolation and PCR of transgenic lines
The plant genomic DNA was extracted from the regenerated putative transgenic shoots using a DNeasy kit (Qiagen, GmbH, Germany), and a PCR was performed using Xa21 and hpt gene-specific primers for preliminary testing of transgenic lines. Non-transgenic control plant DNA was included as negative and plasmid DNA as positive control in each PCR reaction. The primers used for the Xa21 gene were: forward Xa21 5′ TTGTTCTCTGCGCTGCTGCTCTGC 3′ and reverse Xa21 5′ CCAATGGCCGCGGGGATGCTC 3′, and for the hpt gene were: forward 5′ GATGTTGGCGACCTCGT 3′ and reverse 5′ GTGTCACGTTGCAAGACCTG 3′.

Evaluation of transgenic lines for resistance to BXW using rapid bioassay
Twenty five PCR positive transgenic lines containing the rice Xa21 gene were randomly selected for rapid bioassay for disease resistance under growth room condition. Control non-transgenic plants were also included in each experiment. Three in vitro plantlets (with 3–4 leaves) of each line were artificially inoculated with 100 μL of Xcm culture (107 cfu/mL) in the pseudostem as previously reported (Tripathi et al., 2008). For comparison, three non-transgenic plants were inoculated with Xcm and three additional plants with water as control. The inoculated plantlets were cultured into plant tissue culture vessels (Sigma, V0633) containing proliferation medium and incubated at 28°C for a 16 h/8 h light/dark photoperiod under fluorescent tube lights providing illumination of 94 μmol/m2/second for 60 days. Plantlets incubated under in vitro conditions were monitored and assessed for the development of disease symptoms daily for 60 days. The disease symptoms included chlorosis, necrosis and the complete wilting and death of plants. Observations were made regularly and the data recorded for each plantlet. The relative resistance of transgenic lines to Xcm was evaluated 60 days after inoculation of in vitro plantlets. Plantlets were categorized as resistant if a plant did not show any disease symptoms, partial resistant if a plant showed symptoms but the symptoms did not spread to another part of the plant and was not completely wilted, and susceptible if a plant developed symptoms and completely wilted after inoculation similar to control non-transgenic plants. The wilting incidence was calculated as follows: 
 Wiltingincidence(%)=(Numberofplantswilted/Totalnumberofplantsinoculatedperindependenttransgeniclines)×100 

Evaluation of transgenic lines for resistance to BXW in glasshouse using potted plants
The plants of 12 transgenic lines (GX3, GX5, GX8, GX15, GX26, GX36, GX37, GX46, GX57, GX62, GX74 and GX76) previously tested with a rapid screening method were further evaluated using potted plants in the glasshouse. Three plants of each transgenic line and the non-transgenic control were transferred to sterile soil in plastic cups (8 cm diameter) for acclimatization. The plants were maintained in a humid shaded environment for 30 days, transferred to an open environment in the glasshouse for another seven days and then transferred to bigger plastic pots (30 cm diameter). Three month old plants were artificially inoculated by injecting 100 μL of a bacterial suspension (108 cfu/mL) into the midrib of the second fully opened leaf as described by Tripathi et al. (2010). These plants were assessed daily for 60 days for disease symptoms, with preliminary symptoms of chlorosis or yellowing of the leaves and final symptoms of complete wilting of the plants. The relative resistance of transgenic plants to BXW was evaluated at 60 dpi on the basis of the reduction in wilting in comparison with control non-transgenic plants as follows:
 Resistance%=(Reductioninwilting/Totalnumberofleaveswiltedincontrolplant)×100 

where Reduction in wilting = total number of leaves - number of wilted leaves.

Bacterial population analysis in transgenic and non-transgenic plants
Two transgenic line (GX8 and GX26) showing complete resistance against Xcm were further evaluated for growth of bacterial populations. Three month old plants of transgenic lines GX8 and GX26 and non-transgenic control were artificially inoculated by injecting 100 μL of a bacterial suspension (108 cfu/mL) into the midrib of the second fully opened leaf as described by Tripathi et al. (2010). One centimeter long section of midrib of the leaf of inoculated transgenic banana plants and non-transgenic control plants were collected at different time interval (0, 4, 8, 12 and 16 dpi) and ground with 1 ml of sterilized water in a microfuge tube and incubated on shaker at room temperature for 1 hr. Sample suspensions were serially diluted with sterilized water, plated on semi-selective YTSA agar medium (Yeast extract (1%), tryptone (1%), sucrose (1%), agar (1.5%), pH 7.0; Tripathi et al., 2007) supplemented with 50 mg/L cephelexin antibiotic, and incubated at 28°C for 48 h before counting to determine populations. At 16 dpi samples were also collected from midrib section 5 cm above and 5 cm below the point of inoculation and bacterial populations were determined. Two clones of each line were used for each treatment and three replicates were plated for each clone at each time point. The data presented is the average of 6 samples at each time point.

Molecular characterization of transgenic lines
Southern blot analysis
The integration of the Xa21 gene into the genome of banana was analyzed using Southern hybridization. Genomic DNA was isolated from twelve PCR positive transgenic plantlets (GX3, GX5, GX8, GX15, GX26, GX36, GX37, GX46, GX57, GX62, GX74 and GX76) which were evaluated in glasshouse using a modified hexadecyltrimethylammonium bromide (CTAB) extraction method for Musa described by Gawel and Jarret (1991). The pCAMBIA1300-Ubi:Xa21 plasmid (10 pg) and genomic DNA (10 μg) from the transgenic plants were digested with BamHI, which cuts the plasmid vector DNA only at one site (Fig. 2). When integrated into genomic DNA, BamHI cuts once at start of Xa21 gene (outside the probe region) and again in the genomic DNA beyond the T-DNA border. Genomic DNA of non-transgenic banana plant restricted with BamHI enzyme was used as negative control. The restricted DNA was resolved on a 0.8% (w/v) agarose gel and blotted onto the positively charged nylon membrane (Roche Diagnostics, UK). The blots were hybridized with a digoxigenin (DIG) labeled with the 410 bp Xa21 gene specific probe that was part of the Xa21 gene. Hybridization and detection of the probe were carried out using a DIG Luminescent Detection Kit for Nucleic Acids (Roche Diagnostics, UK) according to the manufacturer’s instructions.

RNA extraction, RT-PCR and qRT-PCR analysis
Total RNA was extracted from 100 mg leaf tissue of 12 transgenic banana plants (GX3, GX5, GX8, GX15, GX26, GX36, GX37, GX46, GX57, GX62, GX74 and GX76) which were evaluated in glasshouse using the RNeasy plant mini kit (Qiagen, GmbH, Hilden, Germany) and treated with DNase (RNeasy Plant Mini kit, Qiagen). The quantity and quality (A260/230 and A260/280) of total RNA were determined using the Nanodrop. RNA was checked with PCR for absence of genomic DNA. Complementary DNA (cDNA) was synthesized, starting with 1 μg of total RNA and using reverse transcriptase of the Maxima H Minus First Strand cDNA synthesis kit with oligo DT primers (Thermo scientific). Reverse transcriptase PCR (RT-PCR) was performed with 1 μl of each cDNA synthesized using primers specific to the Xa21 gene (forward primer: 5′ TCCCCAATTCTATCTGGAACCT 3′; reverse primer: 5′ CTCGAGGAGGTGAAGGGTTTT 3′). Amplification of the banana 25S ribosomal transcript, used as an internal control to determine the quality of RNA, was performed using the forward primer (forward primer: 5′ ACATTGTCAGGTGGGGAGTT 3′; reverse primer: 5′ CCTTTTGTTCCACACGAGATT 3′).

Real-time RT-PCR was carried on 7900 Real Time PCR System (Applied Biosystems, USA) using Maxima SYBR green/ROX PCR kit (Thermo Scientific) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. qRT-PCR was performed with 1 μl of each cDNA synthesized at 1:10 dilution, using Xa21 specific primers as mentioned above. Two independent biologically replicated experiments were set up with three technical replicates in each experiment. No-template controls and non-transgenic control were included. Relative expression data were normalized using the banana 25S ribosomal gene. Non-transgenic control plant acts as calibrator to calculate relative expression level of Xa21 in transgenic plants. The relative levels of Xa21 gene were analyzed using the 2−ΔΔCt method (Livak &amp; Schmittgen 2001).

           Growth analysis of transgenic plants
Three replicates of 12 well rooted transgenic plants (GX3, GX5, GX8, GX12, GX15, GX26, GX29, GX32, GX37, GX60, GX62, and GX76) were weaned in small disposable cups in a humid chamber. These transgenic plants were subculture and clonally multiplied from individual transgenic lines in tissue culture facility. The three non-transgenic control plants were included to compare the growth with transgenic plants. Plants were then hardened off for four weeks under low plastic tents where humidity was reduced over time by gradual opening of the side of the tent in the third week. The plants were removed from the plastic tents after four weeks and transferred to 10 liter pots in the glasshouse. Plants were irrigated manually on alternate days, and the temperature maintained at 26–28°C. After 90 days, growth characteristics such as plant height, pseudostem girth at base and middle, total number of leaves, length and width of fully opened third leaf were recorded. Total leaf area was calculated using a formula described by Kumar et al. (2002): 
 Totalleafarea=0.8∗L∗W∗N 

L= length of middle leaf

W= width of middle leaf

N= Total no. of leaves in a plant

Data collection and analysis
The means and standard deviation were calculated for three replicates per experiment. Analysis of variance (ANOVA) was conducted using Minitab 16 (Minitab 16 statistical software, 2012), and interaction between means was by least significant difference (LSD) at P= 0.05. Grouping was performed using the Fisher test.

Supp FIg S1 Figure S1
Schematic alignment of the raxSTAB operon among different Xanthomonas species. The raxSTAB operon consists of three genes: raxST, encodes a tyrosine sulfotransferase; raxA, encodes a predicted membrane fusion protein; and raxB encodes a predicted ABC transporter with a C39C peptidase domain that is predicted to cleave GG-leader peptides. RaxST and RaxB have an average of 89.44% and 88.14% sequence identity, respectively, while RaxA has a lower 79.88% sequence identity, among the tested strains. In Xac, RaxA is not annotated as a protein due to the presence of an early stop codon (x).
