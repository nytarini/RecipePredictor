  Asthma is a common and potentially serious chronic disease that imposes a substantial
burden on patients, their families, and the community.1 It causes respiratory symptoms, limitation of activity, and exacerbations
that sometimes require urgent health care and may be fatal.2 Globally, asthma affects approximately 300 million people, and this number is
expected to reach 400 million by 2050.3 In Palestine, the prevalence rate of asthma in children living in villages,
cities, and refugee camps were 17.1%, 8.8%, and 9.4%, respectively, with urban area
having higher prevalence rate than rural areas.4 Asthma is a serious global health problem affecting all age groups, with
increasing prevalence in many developing countries, rising treatment costs, and a
rising burden for patients and the community.5 Asthma still imposes an unacceptable burden on health care systems and on
society through loss of productivity in the workplace, and it still contributes to
many deaths worldwide.2 A number of factors including genetic predisposition, environmental factors,
and lifestyle factors including dietary habits influence the development and
expression of asthma.6 The goal of asthma treatment is to achieve and maintain clinical control,
which can be achieved in most patients with pharmacologic intervention strategy.7 However, asthma control is still difficult to attain in all patients.8 When asthma is uncontrolled, it has dire consequences for health and well-being.9 Asthma Control Test (ACT) is a short, simple, patient-based tool for
identifying patients with poorly controlled asthma; it is reliable, valid, and
responsive to changes in asthma control over time, and in a clinical setting.10 The ACT is a useful tool to help physicians identify patients with
uncontrolled asthma and facilitate their ability to follow patients&#x2019; progress with treatment.10 Asthma and its complications impact harshly on the finances of individuals
and their families and on health systems and national economies through direct
medical costs and loss of work and wages.1 Dietary patterns is an approach that has been used to investigate
diet-disease relations.11 Studying dietary patterns instead of specific foods or nutrients is a new
approach in nutritional epidemiology to assess the effects of overall diet.12 Dietary patterns is usually determined by factor analysis and has been used
to investigate the role of diet in several chronic diseases,13,14 but rarely in
respiratory diseases.15 Dietary pattern is potentially useful in making dietary recommendations
because overall dietary patterns might be easy for the public to interpret or
translate into diets.16 Diet is one of the lifestyle factors that may play an important role in
development and expression of asthma.17 However, few studies have explored the relationship between dietary patterns
and the level of asthma control. Most studies have examined the associations between
individual foods or food groups and nutrients and the level of asthma
control,18-20 instead of
focusing on dietary patterns which is the most sensible approach to test the role of
the overall diet on nutrition-related diseases. Therefore, understanding the
association between dietary patterns with the level of asthma control may be helpful
in reducing asthma-related premature mortality and improving outcomes among patients
with asthma. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study that examined
this association among patients with asthma in Gaza Strip, Palestine. This study was
conducted to identify major dietary patterns and their association with the level of
asthma control among patients with asthma at Al-Shifa Medical Complex in Gaza Strip,
Palestine.

      Methodology

        Study population
        This cross-sectional study was conducted in the year 2018, among a representative
sample of Palestinian patients with asthma. Patients were randomly selected
using the systemic random sampling method. We recruited 105 patients with
asthma, both sex, aged 19 to 64&#x2009;years, receiving care in the chest department at
Al-Shifa Medical Complex in Gaza Strip, Palestine. This hospital had the biggest
chest department in Gaza Strip with 26 beds.21 Pregnant women; lactating mothers; patients with other type of serious
diseases such as cancer, acute myocardial infarction, end-stage kidney disease,
and septicemia; and patients with other type of respiratory diseases were
excluded from the study.

        Asthma control test
        The ACT was used to determine the level of asthma control.22 The ACT is a patient completed questionnaire with 5 items assessing
asthma symptoms (daytime and nocturnal), use of rescue medications, and the
effect of asthma on daily functioning. Each item includes 5 response options
corresponding to a 5-point Likert-type rating scale. In scoring the ACT,
responses for each of the 5 items are summed to yield a score ranging from 5
(poor control of asthma) to 25 (complete control of asthma).10,23 Then,
patients with asthma were classified into 2 groups: (1) well-controlled asthma
(ACT scores: &gt;19) and (2) poorly controlled asthma (ACT scores: 19 or less).22

        Assessment of anthropometric measurements
        Weight was measured using a standard scale (Seca); the scale was placed on a hard
floor surface; patients were asked to remove their heavy outer garments, and
weight was measured and recorded to the nearest 0.1&#x2009;kg. Height was measured in
all patients (patients bare footed and head upright) with a measuring rod
attached to the balanced beam scale; the height was reported to the nearest
0.5&#x2009;cm. In addition, a stretch-resistant tape was used for measuring waist
circumference (WC); WC was measured at the approximate midpoint between the
lower margin of the last palpable rib and the top of the iliac crest. The body
mass index (BMI) was calculated by dividing weight in kilograms by the square of
height in meters.

        Dietary assessment
        A comprehensive data regarding dietary patterns were collected by an expert
nutritionist, using a validated semi-quantitative food frequency questionnaire
(FFQ). The FFQ is relatively easy and inexpensive to administer and can be used
to measure dietary intake over a prolonged time period.24 In this study, the FFQ contains a list of 98 food items; it was developed
and validated among Palestinian population in 2014.25 In our study, the method of dietary patterns assessment was published as
in the previous study.12 Furthermore, the major dietary patterns were obtained using factor
analysis after the classification of food items into 25 groups (Table 1). The food
grouping was based on the similarity of nutrient profiles and was somewhat
similar to that used in previous studies.26,27

        Assessment of other variables
        The socioeconomic, demographic, behavioral, and medical history data were
collected through an interview-based questionnaire. Reports and all relevant
documentation, including medical records, were also checked. Data about physical
activity were obtained using the International Physical Activity Questionnaire
(IPAQ short version).28 The internationally accepted protocol was used to estimate the weekly
calorie expenditure expressed as metabolic equivalents per week (MET/wk).28 Pilot study was conducted on 15 patients to evaluate the tools of the
study. Then, the tools of the study were modified according to the result of the
pilot study.

        Statistical analysis
        All statistical analysis was performed using SPSS version 20. The major dietary
patterns were obtained using factor analysis. Then, the obtained dietary
patterns scores are expressed as tertiles. The chi-square test was used to
determine the significant differences between different categorical variables.
The differences between means were tested by independent-samples
t test and one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA). Moreover,
the odds ratio (OR) and confidence interval (CI) for the ACT across tertiles
categories of dietary pattern scores were tested by binary logistic regression.
P value less than 0.05 was considered as statistically
significant.

      Results
      A total of 105 patients with asthma aged 19 to 64&#x2009;years old (52.4% women, 47.6% men)
were recruited in this study. The characteristics of the study population by sex are
shown in Table 2. The
results revealed that the mean age (years) for male patients was 41.90&#x2009;&#xB1;&#x2009;14 vs
46.21&#x2009;&#xB1;&#x2009;10 for females. In addition, for the following factors&#x2014;age, educational
level, employment history, history of smoking, multivitamin supplement use, height,
BMI, and physical activity level&#x2014;the difference was statistically significant in
both sexes (P value&#x2009;&lt;&#x2009;0.05 for all). On the contrary, the
results of ACT for the study population by sex are shown in Table 3. The collected data demonstrate
that the mean total scores for ACT in male patients was 15.44&#x2009;&#xB1;&#x2009;4.1 vs 13.65&#x2009;&#xB1;&#x2009;3.6
for females. In addition, only 9.5% of the patients were classified as having
well-controlled asthma (ACT scores: &gt;19), while 90.5% of the patients were
classified as having poorly controlled asthma (ACT scores: 19 or less), and the
difference was statistically significant in both sexes (P
value&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.033). Furthermore, the food consumption data for the 25 food groups (Table 1) were entered into
the SPSS for factor analysis. The scree plot of eigenvalues indicated 2 major
patterns: (1) Prudent dietary pattern characterized by a high intake of whole
grains, beans and legumes, fish and shellfish products, vegetables, tomatoes,
fruits, and vegetable oils as well as a low intake of snacks and (2) Western dietary
pattern characterized by a high intake of refined grains, red meat, poultry, fast
foods, eggs, low-fat dairy product, high-fat dairy products, hydrogenated fats,
olive, sugar, sweets, desserts, and snacks as well as a low intake of fish and
shellfish products. The factor loading matrixes for major patterns are shown in
Table 4. These 2
major dietary patterns explained 14.01% and 12.56% of the total variance,
respectively. Then, the dietary pattern scores were classified as tertiles, and the
characteristics of the study population were evaluated within the tertiles. Table 5 shows that
patients in the lowest tertile (T1) of Prudent pattern were older (48.9&#x2009;&#xB1;&#x2009;12.7 vs
37.5&#x2009;&#xB1;&#x2009;10.8, P value&#x2009;&lt;&#x2009;0.001), 38.1% vs 18.1% were female
(P value&#x2009;&lt;&#x2009;0.005), had a lower education level (52.8% vs
11.1%, P value&#x2009;&lt;&#x2009;0.05), had a high weight (kg) (83.5&#x2009;&#xB1;&#x2009;15.5 vs
78.5&#x2009;&#xB1;&#x2009;15.9, P value&#x2009;&lt;&#x2009;0.05), had a high WC (cm) (106.1&#x2009;&#xB1;&#x2009;13 vs
93.3&#x2009;&#xB1;&#x2009;15, P value&#x2009;&lt;&#x2009;0.005), and had a lower physical activity
level (MET/wk) (1373&#x2009;&#xB1;&#x2009;1446 vs 2304&#x2009;&#xB1;&#x2009;1944, P value&#x2009;&lt;&#x2009;0.05),
compared with those in the highest tertile (T3). On the contrary, only the
distribution of patients regarding having a meal plan for asthma, who describe diet
regimen, number of meal per day, and height (m) was significantly different across
the tertiles of Western dietary pattern (P value&#x2009;&lt;&#x2009;0.05).
Finally, the OR and CI for well-controlled asthma (ACT scores: &gt;19) and poorly
controlled asthma (ACT scores: 19 or less) across tertile categories of dietary
pattern scores were computed (Table 6). Our findings revealed that, after adjustment for confounding
variables, patients in the lowest tertile (T1) of Prudent dietary pattern had a
lower odds for poorly controlled asthma (OR&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.044, 95% CI&#x2009;=&#x2009;[0.002-1.316],
P value&#x2009;&lt;&#x2009;0.05), while patients in the lowest tertile (T1)
of Western dietary pattern had a higher odds for poorly controlled asthma
(OR&#x2009;=&#x2009;2.499, 95% CI&#x2009;=&#x2009;[1.288-4.850], P value&#x2009;&lt;&#x2009;0.05), compared
with those in the highest tertile (T3). No significant associations were found
between these 2 major dietary patterns with well-controlled asthma.

      Discussion
      Asthma is a common and potentially serious chronic disease that imposes a substantial
burden on patients, their families, and the community.1 Uncontrolled asthma is associated with decreased quality of life and
increased health care system use.9 Our study was conducted to determine the associations between major dietary
patterns and the level of asthma control among patients with asthma at Al-Shifa
Medical Complex in Gaza Strip, Palestine. To the best of our knowledge, this is the
first study that examined this association among patients with asthma in Gaza Strip,
Palestine. In our study, 105 patients with asthma (52.4% women, 47.6% men) were
divided into 2 groups according to the results of ACT (poorly controlled asthma and
well-controlled asthma). Our results revealed that only 9.5% of the patients had
well-controlled asthma (ACT scores: &gt;19), while 90.5% of the patients were
classified as having poorly controlled asthma (ACT scores: 19 or less). Previous
studies reported that poorly controlled asthma was found among a sizable percentage
(40%) of US adults with asthma.29 Lee et al9 in a cross-sectional study show that, among patients with asthma, more than
half of patients (54.4%) had very poor or not well-controlled asthma. In addition,
Chapman et al30 show that most (59%) of patients with asthma treated in general practice were
uncontrolled. In our study, lack of asthma control can be due to a complex web of
factors including genetics factors, types of asthma drugs, adherence, intrinsic
factors, psychological factors, and environmental exposures, which could contribute
to these results.
      On the contrary, with the use of dietary data from the FFQ, 2 major dietary patterns
were identified by factor analysis: (1) a Prudent dietary pattern characterized by a
high intake of whole grains, beans and legumes, fish and shellfish products,
vegetables, tomatoes, fruits, and vegetable oils as well as a low intake of snacks,
and (2) a Western dietary pattern characterized by a high intake of refined grains,
red meat, poultry, fast foods, eggs, low-fat dairy product, high-fat dairy products,
hydrogenated fats, olive, sugar, sweets, desserts, and snacks as well as a low
intake of fish and shellfish products. The main findings of this study indicate
that, after adjustment for confounding variables, a Prudent dietary pattern may be
associated with a lower prevalence of poorly controlled asthma, whereas a Western
dietary pattern may be associated with a higher prevalence of poorly controlled
asthma among patients with asthma in Gaza Strip, Palestine. In fact, studying the
overall effect of dietary patterns on asthma control is an emerging literature; an
overall approach based on dietary patterns could provide some insight into the
combination of foods that might be beneficial or detrimental to asthma control.31 In addition, very few population-based studies have been conducted to
investigate the association between dietary patterns and the level of asthma
control, which made the comparison of our results with previous studies difficult.
Most studies have examined the associations between individual foods or food groups
and nutrients and asthma outcomes.18-20 Poongadan et al in a
cross-sectional study show an increased consumption of vegetables and cereals in
patients with total controlled asthma in comparison with partially and poorly
controlled asthma. In addition, the author revealed increased consumption of sugar,
non-vegetarian, fast food, salted, and fried snacks in patients with poorly
controlled asthma.17 Garcia-Marcos et al32 in a meta-analysis of 8 cross-sectional studies in children concluded that
the Mediterranean diet might protect against asthma ever and current wheeze.
Furthermore, a positive correlation exists between consumption of diet rich in
vegetables and fresh fruits along with lifestyle habits as periodical exercise and
good asthma control.33 Iikura et al33 in their study in Japanese population concluded raw vegetable intake (more
than 5 units/wk) was significantly associated with good asthma control. The results
of our study support these findings. Moreover, an association between dietary
patterns and newly diagnosed chronic obstructive pulmonary disease was reported in a
large cohort of men and women in the United States.15 A Prudent dietary pattern characterized by a high intake of fruits,
vegetables, fish, and whole grain products was associated with a decreased risk,
whereas a Western pattern characterized by a high intake of refined grains, cured
and red meats, desserts, and French fries was associated with an increased risk.15 The results of our study support these findings. The previous dietary
patterns are different from those obtained in our study. This can be explained by
demographic, cultural, and ethnic differences, varying between countries,
influencing behavior and attitudes regarding food choices.
      In our study, the inverse association between Prudent dietary pattern with poorly
controlled asthma could be attributed to pattern&#x2019;s healthy ingredients including
vitamins, dietary fibers, potassium, magnesium, and antioxidants. These nutrients
have been independently associated with reduced risks of asthma exacerbation.34 In addition, anti-inflammatory and antioxidant effects in these foods may
have beneficial effects in alleviating inflammation and oxidative stress, which are
pathogenic factors in asthma exacerbation.35 Furthermore, vegetables, legumes, and fruits contain minerals, polyphenols,
and other phytochemicals that combat oxidative stress and inflammation.36,37 In our study,
the Prudent dietary pattern has been shown to be the healthiest dietary pattern and
is quite close to that diet, which is generally recommended as a healthy dietary
pattern with low animal foods, saturated fat, trans fat, cholesterol, and simple
sugar, which may be associated with a higher risks of asthma exacerbation.38 Our study is not adjusted for other confounding variables such as genetics
factors, types of asthma drugs, adherence, intrinsic factors, psychological factors,
and environmental exposures, which could contribute to these results. Actually, the
relationship between dietary patterns with the level of asthma control needs more
studies in the future.
      The main limitation of this study is its cross-sectional design; the causal
relationship could not be determined. Moreover, the possibility of recall bias and
misreporting by using FFQ assessment of dietary patterns are other limitations. The
main strength of our study was its being the first study, which identified the major
dietary patterns and their association with the level of asthma control among
patients with asthma in Gaza Strip, Palestine.

      Conclusion
      In conclusion, a Prudent dietary pattern may be associated with a lower prevalence of
poorly controlled asthma, whereas a Western dietary pattern may be associated with a
higher prevalence of poorly controlled asthma among patients with asthma in Gaza
Strip, Palestine. Further future studies with large sample size are required to
confirm these findings.
