behaviour within the primate order. Considerable attention has been focused on
chimpanzees, Pan troglodytes, because they are our closest living
relatives and participate in a wide range of collective activities, including hunting and
food sharing. Food sharing is of particular importance because it plays a critical role in
the human foraging niche, but food sharing among adults is rare in nonhuman primates. Some
research suggests that chimpanzees selectively share meat with reciprocating partners and
allies, while other work indicates that chimpanzees primarily share to reduce harassment
from other group members (tolerated theft). We examined the effects of kinship,
relationship quality, reciprocity and the intensity of solicitations on the pattern of
food transfers in six captive groups of chimpanzees. We observed events that occurred
after the chimpanzees were provisioned with large frozen juice disks. These disks share
some properties with prey carcasses: they are a valued, but limited, resource; they take a
considerable period of time to consume; they can be monopolized by one individual, but
bits can be broken off and transferred to others. Our analyses suggest that food transfers
serve multiple functions for chimpanzees. Individuals may use food transfers to enhance
the welfare of closely related group members, strengthen social relationships with
favoured partners and reduce the costs of persistent solicitations.

   Humans form larger, more complex and more cooperative societies than other vertebrate
taxa, and this has generated interest in how we came to be such unusual creatures (Burkhart et al. 2009; Warneken &amp; Tomasello 2009; Silk &amp;
Boyd 2010). Efforts to understand the phylogenetic origins of cooperation within the
human lineage have focused on chimpanzees, Pan troglodytes, for several
important reasons. First, chimpanzees are our closest living relatives. Second, chimpanzees
participate in a wider range of collective activities than most other nonhuman primates. In
the wild, male chimpanzees groom one another, form coalitions, jointly defend access to mates
and patrol the borders of their territories (Muller &amp;
Mitani 2005). Female chimpanzees are less gregarious than males, but form lasting
social bonds with other females (Boesch &amp;
Boesch-Achermann 2000; Gilby &amp; Wrangham
2008; Langergraber et al. 2009). Adult females
often share food with their offspring, particularly foods that are difficult for their
offspring to procure or process on their own (McGrew
1975; Silk 1978; Nishida &amp; Turner 1996). Third, chimpanzees are the only
nonhuman primate species in which food is regularly shared among adults in the wild (Jaeggi &amp; van Schaik 2011). Food sharing among
chimpanzees is of particular interest because food sharing is a universal feature of human
societies and plays a critical role in the human foraging niche (Kaplan et al. 2009).

Food sharing also occurs outside the primate order (Stevens &amp; Gilby 2004). For example, males sometimes provide resources to
prospective mates during courtship, carnivores sometimes hunt together and share access to
kills, and in cooperatively breeding species, breeding females are sometimes provisioned by
other group members. Although reciprocity and kin selection are most often invoked to explain
food sharing, Stevens &amp; Gilby (2004) emphasized
the importance of others factors, such as by-product mutualism and group augmentation. They
also discussed the possibility that food sharing may sometimes be a form of tolerated theft
(Blurton Jones 1984; Moore 1984) or sharing under pressure (Wrangham
1975; Stevens &amp; Stephens 2002; Stevens &amp; Gilby 2004), as possessors share food in
order to reduce the costs of defending resources against rivals.

Adult chimpanzees frequently hunt monkeys and small mammals, regularly share meat
from the carcasses of captured prey (Muller &amp; Mitani
2005) and occasionally share plant foods with other adults (McGrew 1975; Slocombe &amp;
Newton-Fisher 2005; Hockings et al. 2011). The
evolutionary forces shaping food transfers among chimpanzees are the subject of much
discussion. In the Taï Forest of Côte d’Ivoire and in Ngogo in the
Kibale Forest of Uganda, males selectively transfer meat to males that have also transferred
meat to them and to males that support them in agonistic interactions (Mitani &amp; Watts 1999, 2001; Boesch &amp; Boesch-Achermann 2000;
Mitani 2006). Reciprocal transfers of plant foods
have also been documented in captive chimpanzees (de Waal
1989, 1997; Jaeggi et al. 2010a). However, among chimpanzees at the Gombe Stream in Tanzania,
Gilby (2006) found no correlation between meat
transfer and grooming or proximity within dyads. He argued that males at Gombe give up parts
of their kills ‘to avoid the costs of defending a food item against persistent
beggars’. Thus, food transfers may be a form of tolerated theft (Blurton Jones 1984) or sharing under pressure (Wrangham 1975; Stevens &amp;
Stephens 2002; Stevens &amp; Gilby
2004).

There have also been reports that males exchange meat for sex with receptive females.
Such transfers have been reported to enhance immediate mating opportunities at Gombe (Stanford 1998) and future mating prospects, but not
immediate ones, in the Taï Forest (Gomes &amp;
Boesch 2011). However, in a detailed review of patterns of food transfers and mating
behaviour at several east African sites (Gombe, Kanyawara, Ngogo), Gilby et al. (2010) found no evidence that the presence of oestrous
females increased the likelihood that males would hunt or preferentially transfer meat to
receptive females, or that food transfers enhanced males’ short-term mating success.
They concluded that ‘meat transfers in chimpanzees are rarely sexually
motivated’ (page 51).

Although these studies provide very different interpretations of food transfers in
chimpanzees, they are not necessarily incompatible. It is possible that food transfers may
serve different functions in different contexts. Some food transfers may enhance the welfare
of closely related group members, while others may strengthen alliances with favoured partners
or enhance future mating prospects. In some cases, food transfers may reflect a trade-off
between the benefits of monopolizing food items and the costs of defending them. Transfers may
be made after persistent solicitations, but if possessors control the distribution of food,
they may still be able to direct transfers selectively to reciprocating partners (Gurven 2004; Jaeggi et al.
2010a, b).

Here we examine the effects of kinship, relationship quality, reciprocity and the
intensity of solicitations on the pattern of food transfers in six captive groups of
chimpanzees. Our analyses focus on events that occurred after the chimpanzees were provisioned
with large (30.5 × 12.5 cm) frozen juice disks. These frozen disks share some
properties with prey carcasses: they are a valued, but limited, resource because only two or
three are provided at one time to the group; they take considerable time to consume; they can
be monopolized by one individual, but portions can be detached and transferred to other
individuals, and more than one individual can feed on a disk at the same time.

METHODS
The study was conducted at the Michale E. Keeling Center for Comparative Medicine
and Research (Bastrop, TX, U.S.A.). We observed all members of six groups that were housed
in large outdoor compounds (22.86 m in diameter for a total of area of 410.25 m2)
connected to indoor enclosures. The outdoor compounds contained enrichment devices (e.g.
climbing structures, ropes and swings, barrels, and other toys). The chimpanzees had ad
libitum access to primate chow and water during the day. Each group also received fruit and
vegetable feeds four times per day, as well as additional food and material enrichment
several times per week. The animals spent the majority of their time in the outdoor
compounds, and during observations, the doors to the indoor enclosures were closed so that
all chimpanzees in the group remained outside and in view.

The study groups ranged in size from 7 to 14 individuals (Table 1). The composition of social groups was stable over the
course of our study, and most individuals had lived in the same group since the late 1970s.
There were few young infants or juveniles in the study groups because females had been
fitted with contraceptive devices to prevent conception. None of the females were pregnant
or lactating during the study period, and all but five of the adult females were cycling.
Information about kinship, dominance rank and female reproductive status were obtained from
colony records.

Pant-grunts are submissive vocalizations that provide a clear indicator of
dominance and subordinance in chimpanzees (Wroblewski et al.
2009). In the study population, pant-grunt vocalizations were monitored during
social introductions and periods of high activity such as feeding and enrichment
distribution. Individuals that received pant-grunts from all other same-sexed individuals
and never directed them at other same-sexed individuals were categorized as high-ranking.
Individuals that both pant-grunted to other same-sex individuals and received pant-grunts
from other same-sex individuals were classified as middle-ranking. Individuals that
pant-grunted to other same-sex individuals, but never received pant grunts from other
same-sex individuals were categorized as low-ranking.

The groups included 28 mother–offspring pairs, 11 pairs of siblings (3
male–male, 6 male–female and 2 female–female pairs), three
grandmother–grand–offspring dyads, and one uncle–niece dyad.
Paternal relatedness was not known for all dyads and is not included in the analyses. For
the purposes of these analyses, we assumed that siblings were related by 0.25 and that the
single uncle–niece dyad was related by 0.125.

Observations of Food Transfers
We monitored events that occurred after the chimpanzees were provisioned with
frozen juice disks. The disks were made by mixing fruit juice, water and peanuts together
and freezing them in a round mould, which measured approximately 30.5 cm in diameter. The
disks were removed from the mould before they were given to the chimpanzees. The
chimpanzees were familiar with frozen juice as an enrichment treat. However, during the
period of testing, frozen juice was not given as enrichment in order to maximize interest
in the disks. Groups that contained seven to nine individuals were provisioned with two
disks, and groups that contained at least 10 individuals were provisioned with three
disks. The observer threw the disks into the compound in quick succession and began
monitoring one disk. All coding was done in real time. The focal disk was chosen at random
before the observation session began. Most observations were conducted in the morning,
several hours after the chimpanzees had one of their regularly scheduled feedings. No more
than one session was conducted per day on any group.

Observers noted the identity of the individual that first established possession
of the disk and recorded all interactions that followed with that disk. If the disk was
divided into more than one piece, the observer monitored the largest piece of the original
disc. The observation session ended when the focal disk or the focal portion of the
original disk was consumed fully.

All interactions between the possessor of the disk and other group members were
recorded on a continuous basis. The observer recorded the identity of individuals that
approached the possessor and kept track of their position relative to the possessor. We
recorded all begging gestures (extending the hand towards the possessor) and the
possessors’ responses to solicitors’ behaviour, which included turning
away from the solicitor while remaining in the same location, moving away from the
solicitor (avoid), threatening the solicitor or doing nothing (ignore).

Food transfers occurred in several different ways. In some cases, the possessor
handed a piece of the disk to the solicitor. Following Boesch &amp; Boesch (1989), these interactions are categorized as
‘active’ transfers. We recorded two types of ‘passive’
transfers: (1) ‘co-feeding’ occurred when the possessor maintained
possession of the disk, but allowed another individual to lick or bite the disk while it
was on the ground or in their hand; and (2) ‘collecting’ was recorded when
the solicitor took pieces that had fallen off the disk while the possessor was eating it
without resistance by the possessor (labelled ‘collect near’ by de Waal 1989 and ‘recovery’ by Boesch &amp; Boesch 1989). We included both types of
passive transfers in our analyses because it was possible for possessors to deter or
prevent such transfers by threatening solicitors or moving the disk out of reach.
‘Forced transfers’ were recorded when one chimpanzee took food from a
possessor who actively resisted the transfer. The analyses focused on the frequency and
pattern of active and passive transfers.

Baseline Information about Social Behaviour
We also collected information about social behaviour in the group at times when
provisioning events were not occurring. We conducted scan samples (Altmann 1974) of group members at 3 min intervals; scan sampling
sessions lasted 60 min. On each scan, observers noted the activities of each group member
in the same order. For the purposes of this study, the data of interest were (1) grooming,
(2) sitting in contact and (3) sitting in arm’s reach. We completed a total of 313
1-hour scan sampling sessions (range 44–58 sessions per group).

Analysis Procedures
Analyses of food transfers were based on 95 provisioning sessions (15–17
sessions per group; N = 68 h). From the observational data, we
extracted information about the identity of each possessor, the order of possession within
each session, the duration of each possession, events that precipitated changes in
possession, begging gestures, responses to begging gestures and types of food
transfers.

Data derived from the scan samples were used to assess relationship quality. We
tabulated the frequency with which each individual was in proximity, contact or grooming
every other individual in the group. The frequencies of grooming, proximity and contact
were positively correlated within dyads and do not represent independent sources of
information about relationship quality. Following procedures previously developed for
analyses of baboon social relationships, we created a composite index of sociality (CSI)
for each dyad using the following formula.  CSIxy=∑i=13fixyf¯i3 

In this equation, fixy is the rate of behaviour
i for dyad xy, and f¯i is the mean rate of behaviour i across all
dyads (see Silk et al. 2006). High values of the
CSI represent dyads with stronger social relationships than the average dyad in their
group, and low values represent dyads with weaker relationships than the average dyad in
their group.

For analyses in which the individual is the unit of analysis, we examined the
effects of individual characteristics (dominance rank category, sex and age) on patterns
of behaviour, such as the number of possessions. Sex and dominance rank category are
confounded because most adult and subadult males outrank all adult females. Because of
ambiguities about the ranks of immature males and females, we excluded individuals below
the age of 8 years in analyses of the effects of rank category. For analyses of the
effects of the difference in dominance rank category between possessors and solicitors, we
assumed that adult and subadult males outranked all females. When possessors outranked
solicitors, we assigned the dyad a rank difference score of 2. When possessors held the
same rank as solicitors, we assigned the dyad a rank difference score of 1. When
possessors were subordinate to solicitors, we assigned the dyad a rank difference score of
0.

We used generalized linear mixed models (GLMM) for analyses in which individuals
were sampled more than once and not all individuals contributed equally to the data set.
For analyses in which the dyad was the unit of analysis, we treated the identity of the
possessor as a random effect parameter. For analyses of the continuous variables, we
conducted multilevel mixed effect linear regressions. For analyses of the number of food
transfers, in which the outcome variable was a count variable, we conducted multilevel
mixed effect Poisson regressions and included time of possession as an exposure variable.
Standardized regression coefficients (β) are given throughout.

We used one-way ANOVA to evaluate the effects of categorical variables (e.g.
age–sex class, dominance rank) on continuous outcome variables. All statistical
analyses were conducted with Stata 11.2 (StatCorp, College Station, TX, U.S.A.). Where
appropriate, means and standard errors are presented. All statistical tests are two
tailed.

RESULTS
We begin by providing a general description of provisioning events and food
transfers. Observations of provisioning events began when the disks were thrown into the
enclosure and ended when the disk was fully consumed. This took on average 41.6 ±
2.1 min, and on average 2.7 ± 0.2 (range 1–10) different individuals were in
possession of the focal portion of the disk as it was being consumed. The length of
possessions declined as the order of possession increased and the disk shrank (mixed effects
linear regression: β = −231.05 ± 50.55; Z
= −4.57, N = 245 possessions, P
&lt; 0.001; Fig. 1).

Fifty-one of the 62 chimpanzees (82%) in the six study groups were in
possession of disks at least once. Because the number of observation sessions per group
varied (range 15–17), we computed the number of possessions per session and the
average length of possessions (minutes per possession). There was no significant difference
in the number of possessions per session across age–sex classes (one-way ANOVA:
F5,56 = 0.73, P = 0.6066) or
the length of possessions (F5,45 = 0.80,
P = 0.5539; for definitions of age–sex classes see Table 1). There was no consistent effect of dominance
rank category on the number of possessions per session for either sex (males:
F2,17 = 0.48, P = 0.6266;
females: F2,35 = 0.07, P =
0.9332). Similarly, dominance rank category did not consistently affect the length of
possessions for males (F2,15 = 1.72, P
= 0.2134) or females (F2,27 = 2.29,
P = 0.1204).

Forty-five of the 51 chimpanzees (88%) that were in possession of disks
were also involved in food transfers. Food transfers took several different forms. Nearly
half of all transfers occurred when the possessor of the disk allowed another individual to
co-feed from the disk while it was on the ground or in the possessor’s hand
(49%). Another 37% of transfers occurred when solicitors collected pieces of
food that had fallen off the disk. Active transfers of food to solicitors and forced thefts
by solicitors were both uncommon (active transfers: 8%; forced thefts:
6%).

Begging gestures typically preceded food transfers. The rate of food transfers
(number of active and passive transfers per minute of possession) was substantially higher
when solicitors begged for food than when they remained passive (beg: 0.067 ± 0.01,
N = 215; no beg: 0.01 ± 0.001, N
= 266; F1,479 = 50.18, P
&lt; 0.001).

Possessors often resisted solicitations. In 69% of the 215 cases in which
possessors were confronted with solicitors who begged from them, they resisted. When
possessors resisted, they mainly responded by turning (41%) or moving away from
solicitors (51%), but sometimes threatened them (8%).

The number of solicitations was linked to the nature of the possessors’
responses. For each possession, we calculated the rate of begging (number of gestures per
minute of possession) by each solicitor and identified the most active form of response by
the possessor towards the solicitor. We ranked responses in the following order: 1 =
ignore, 2 = turn away, 3 = move away, 4 = threaten. Low rates of
begging were likely to be ignored, while higher rates of begging gestures were associated
with progressively more active types of responses (ß = 0.31 ± 0.04,
Z = 7.28, N = 481 interactions,
P &lt; 0.001; Fig. 2).

Factors That Influence Food Transfers within Dyads
Based on previous studies of food transfers among chimpanzees, we expected food
transfers to be biased in favour of close kin, particularly mothers and offspring.
Chimpanzees might also reciprocate food transfers by transferring food most often to those
that transferred food most often to them. Alternatively, food transfers might be part of a
more generalized form of reciprocity in which individuals exchange various types of
resources and services. If so, we would expect to find a positive relationship between
food transfers and relationship quality. If food transfers are a form of tolerated theft
or sharing under pressure, then food transfers may be influenced by the rank difference
between possessor and solicitor or the number of solicitations directed towards
possessors. The effectiveness of solicitations may interact with other variables, so we
also examined the interactions between the frequency of solicitations and each of the
other predictor variables. Kinship and relationship quality were positively correlated
(N = 297 dyads, P = 0.34), but the
degree of collinearity was low enough to include both variables in the models.

For active transfers, the full model was highly significant. Kinship, the rank
difference between the possessor and solicitor, and the frequency of begging had
significant positive effects on the number of active transfers (Table 2, model 1). Relationship quality, direct reciprocity and
all of the interaction terms were nonsignificant. We first removed all of the interaction
terms and examined the linear effects of the predictor variables on active transfers. In
this model, kinship, direct reciprocity, begging frequency and the rank difference between
the possessor and recipient all had significant, positive effects on the frequency of
active transfers (Table 2, model 2).
Akaike’s Information Criterion (AIC) value for model 2 was lower than that for the
full model (model 1: 186.9; model 2: 183.9). The elimination of the nonsignificant
relationship quality term reduced the AIC value slightly (183.4; Table 2, model 3). These models indicate that possessors made
more active transfers to close kin than to distant kin or nonkin, to those from whom they
received the most active transfers, and to those that begged most frequently. Possessors
were more likelyto make active transfers to those that ranked below them than to those who
held the same rank or ranked above them. Direct reciprocity had a substantially smaller
impact on active transfers than did other variables.

For passive transfers, the full model was highly significant. Kinship,
relationship quality, the rank difference between the possessor and solicitor, and the
frequency of begging significantly increased the number of passive transfers (Table 3, model 1). In addition, there were significant
interactions between the frequency of begging and all of the other variables. When the
nonsignificant term was excluded from the model, the AIC value declined (model 1: 741.3;
model 2: 739.7).

Taken together this set of models indicates that the frequency of passive
sharing is increased among kin and close associates. High levels of begging also increase
the frequency of passive sharing. Passive sharing is more common when possessors outrank
solicitors than vice versa. High frequencies of begging tended to reduce the positive
impact of relationship quality and rank differences on the number of passive transfers,
while frequent begging amplified the positive effects of direct reciprocity on passive
transfers.

DISCUSSION
Our results suggest that food transfers may serve multiple functions for
chimpanzees. Individuals may use food transfers to provision closely related group members,
strengthen relationships with close associates, reciprocate food transfers that they have
received in the past and reduce the costs of persistent solicitations. Thus, decisions about
whether to initiate, tolerate or resist food transfers may reflect a complex, albeit
unconscious, calculus in which individuals weigh the value of the resources they control,
the nature and quality of their relationship to solicitors, the past behaviour of solicitors
and the costs of resisting solicitations.

Several lines of evidence are consistent with the view that food transfers mainly
occur as a response to persistent solicitations, which constitute a form of harassment.
First, food transfers were typically preceded by begging gestures. Second, the frequency of
begging gestures was significantly related to the frequency of both active and passive
transfers within dyads. Third, low levels of begging were likely to be ignored, while higher
levels of begging were associated with progressively more active types of responses that
seemed to reflect the possessors desire to resist solicitations.

Despite this, there is also evidence that possessors can control the distribution
of food, a critical prerequisite for behavioural strategies based on nepotism, reciprocity
or selective tolerance (Jaeggi et al. 2010a, b). For example, more active transfers were directed to
close kin and reciprocating partners than to others when the frequency of begging was held
constant. Similarly, passive transfers were selectively directed to close kin and close
associates. Moreover, the negative interactions between begging frequency and several of the
main predictor variables suggest that frequent begging can have an inhibitory effect on
passive food transfers to close kin, close associates and subordinates. The positive
interaction between begging frequency and direct reciprocity of passive transfers suggests
that begging may prompt partners to reciprocate.

It is not clear whether the patterns observed here are also characteristic of wild
populations of chimpanzees in which meat is the main food item exchanged among adults and
males monopolize possessions. Our study groups contained fewer mature males than most wild
chimpanzee groups, and more of our data was based on food transfers by females than is the
case in studies of meat sharing in the wild. It seems likely that relationship quality might
have a greater influence in free-ranging communities than it did in our groups, as
free-ranging males often form strong bonds with unrelated males (Mitani 2006). It is also possible that differences in
chimpanzees’ interest in meat and the frozen juice disks may influence the patterns
of food distribution. This may be, for example, why adult males did not monopolize access to
the disks, and why dominance rank did not have a greater influence on food transfers.
Finally, the per-capita number of disks distributed in each session was higher than the
per-capita number of kills in most hunting parties. The relative abundance of these items
may have altered patterns of transfers in some way.

The pattern of food transfers in chimpanzees is relevant to ongoing discussions of
the motives underlying cooperation in chimpanzees and other primates and of the origins of
human concern for the welfare of others. In humans, food sharing and other forms of
cooperation extend beyond networks of close kin and reciprocating partners (Hill et al. 2011; Alvard
2012). In a range of experimental contexts, people from a wide range of cultures
behave as if they prefer outcomes that benefit others, even when there is no opportunity for
nepotism, reciprocity or reputational gains (e.g. Henrich et
al. 2004, 2010). Thus, while humans are
clearly motivated by self-interest, they also feel concern for the welfare of others and
this concern motivates them to act in ways that go beyond motives derived from direct
reciprocity and kinship.

It is difficult to determine whether similar motives underlie food transfers in
chimpanzees. However, the pattern of these transfers seems to suggest that they are
motivated more by kinship, relationship quality, reciprocity and the avoidance of conflict
than by motives associated with other evolutionary processes (Chudek &amp; Henrich 2010). Thus, chimpanzees preferentially transfer food to
kin, reciprocating partners, close associates and perhaps to potential mates. If possessors
were strongly motivated by concerns for the welfare of others that go beyond the standard
evolutionary models, it seems likely that they would spontaneously offer food to others more
often, respond more enthusiastically to solicitations, and extend generosity beyond kin and
close associates. Thus, food transfers seem compatible with (genetic) self-interest, and
standard evolutionary models seem sufficient to explain the evolution of food transfers in
chimpanzees.

The patterns of food sharing are largely consistent with the results of
experimental studies that were designed to probe the motives that underlie prosociality.
There are important methodological differences in these studies, and some dispute about
which set of studies provides the most informative insight about chimpanzees’
prosocial preferences (de Waal 2009; Jaeggi et al. 2010b; Melis
&amp; Semmann 2010; Silk &amp; House
2011). However, a comparison of chimpanzees’ behaviour across the full
range of experiments indicates that chimpanzees perform helpful responses on behalf of
others approximately half of the time, even though they are paired with familiar group
members and the cost of helping is very low (Silk &amp;
House 2011). Thus, the experimental evidence suggests that chimpanzees are
considerably less strongly motivated by concern for the welfare of others than humans
are.

Knowledge of the pattern of naturalistic food transfers may inform our design of
experimental studies of chimpanzee social preferences (Jaeggi et al. 2010b). For instance, the observation that active transfers are
uncommon in chimpanzees suggests that it may be profitable to focus on situations in which
there are opportunities for passive transfers. Subjects might be given the opportunity to
monopolize food or consume it within range of potential solicitors (see de Waal 2000). By varying the quantity, quality and
monopolizability of food systematically, it might be possible to evaluate trade-offs between
access to desirable food items and the costs of solicitation. Careful analysis of
naturalistic behavioural data and well-designed experiments will both contribute to a more
complete understanding of the motives and preferences that shape altruistic behaviour in
chimpanzees.
