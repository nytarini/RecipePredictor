        The present study was conducted to develop and assess the quality of carrageenan incorporated chevon patties with the objective of reducing fat content. Efficacy of carrageenan as fat replacers (0.3, 0.6 &amp; 0.9&#xA0;%) was assessed for development of low fat chevon patties. Emulsion stability and cooking yield increased with the increase in levels of carrageenan. Significantly (P&#xA0;&lt;&#xA0;0.05) lower fat and cholesterol contents and higher moisture and fat retention were observed in formulation with carrageenan. No significant difference in the mineral content in either of the treatment was recorded. Incorporation of fat replacer in chevon patties demonstrated significant effect on all the textural parameters except adhesiveness. Results of color value illustrated that lightness (L*) value differ significantly. Sensory scores were higher or comparable for patties containing 0.6&#xA0;% carrageenan as compared to control. Hence, carrageenan was observed to be suitable as fat replacer for producing low fat chevon meat patties.
