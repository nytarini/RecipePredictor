To test the reliability and validity of the Nutrition Literacy
Assessment Instrument (NLit) in adult primary care and to identify the
relationship between nutrition literacy and diet quality.

Design
This instrument validation study included a cross-sectional sample
participating in up to two visits one month apart.

Participants/setting
429 adults with nutrition-related chronic disease were recruited from
clinics and patient registry affiliated with a Midwestern university medical
center.

Main outcome measures
Nutrition literacy was measured by the NLit, comprised of six
subscales: Nutrition &amp; Health, Energy Sources in Food, Food Label
&amp; Numeracy, Household Food Measurement, Food Groups, and Consumer
Skills. Diet quality was measured by Healthy Eating Index (HEI)- 2010 using
nutrient data from Diet History Questionnaire II surveys.

Analysis
Factor validity and reliability were measured by binary confirmatory
factor analysis, test-retest reliability was measured by Pearson’s
r and the intraclass correlation coefficient, and
relationships between nutrition literacy and diet quality were analyzed by
linear regression.

Results
The NLit demonstrated substantial factor validity and reliability
(0.97, CI =0.96–0.98) and test-retest reliability (0.88,
CI=0.85–0.90). Nutrition literacy was the most significant predictor
of diet quality (β=0.17, R2 =0.10, p&lt;0.0001).

Conclusions
The NLit is a valid and reliable tool for measuring nutrition
literacy in adult primary care patients.

   INTRODUCTION
Six of the top ten leading causes of death in the US are chronic diseases
preventable by consuming a healthy diet1,2, yet unhealthy
nutrient consumption and dietary patterns persist for a majority of
Americans3,4. Although healthy eating behaviors are
multifactorial, it is possible that an important overlooked contributor is nutrition
literacy; that is, health literacy applied to the nutrition context.

Nearly half of US adults have difficulty understanding and utilizing commonly
provided types of health information5, making health literacy an important mediator of health
outcomes6. These deficits
in health literacy are associated with poorer use of preventive care
services7 ; difficulty with
self-management of disease8,9, and poorer health status10. Because nutrition is a major
fundamental factor in the development and treatment of diabetes11, hypertension12 ; hyperlipidemia13, and obesity14, low nutrition literacy may be
particularly problematic.

Nutrition literacy is “the degree to which individuals have the
capacity to obtain, process, and understand nutrition information and skills needed
in order to make appropriate nutrition decisions”15. While the research literature in nutrition
literacy is growing, it is nonetheless small, requiring inclusion of general health
literacy literature within discussions of nutrition literacy. Increasing evidence
demonstrates that most people encounter difficulty using information found on food
labels16–18 and those with low health literacy
and/or numeracy struggle more19–21 and
suffer worse health outcomes. Zoellner et al demonstrated in a low-income rural
population that as health literacy scores decrease, diet quality also
decreases22.

In order to identify the presence and potential consequences of low
nutrition literacy, researchers and clinicians must first be able to measure
nutrition literacy. Many tools exist for measuring health literacy and these have
evolved from simply measuring print literacy within the context of health care
terminology23, to print
literacy and numeracy24–26, to a broader range of health
literacy related skills, utilizing a variety of approaches to measurement27. Most often, researchers measuring
health literacy in the context of nutrition have used the Newest Vital
Sign26, which references a
Nutrition Facts Panel of ice cream. The Diabetes Numeracy Test28 is also relevant to nutrition for
the diabetes population because it includes carbohydrate counting. The Nutrition
Literacy Scale29 is described in
the literature, and by description appears to measure print literacy within the
context of nutrition although further use has not been described in the literature.
More recently, the Critical Nutrition Literacy Scale30 was developed to measure perceived ability to
critically analyze nutrition information and engage in actions to reduce barriers to
healthy eating. While any of these tools could be used for specific purposes, none
provide a broad assessment of nutrition literacy skills important for implementing
nutrition recommendations for nutrition-related chronic illnesses commonly seen in
primary care.

The Nutrition Literacy Assessment Instrument (NLit) was designed to assess
print literacy and numeracy within nutrition contexts and the capability to apply
nutrition knowledge and skills. A multistep process of engaging nutrition
professionals and patients was employed to develop the constructs and items of the
NLit. First, experts in nutrition education were interviewed to identify constructs
of nutrition literacy and registered dietitians were surveyed to provide feedback on
approaches for measuring nutrition literacy within these constructs31,32. Variations of the instrument were developed and pil ot
tested separately in 2 populations including breast cancer patients
(NLit-BCa)33 and parents
(NLit-P)34 demonstrating
moderate to substantial reliability for individual instrument domains, and positive
linear relationships with diet quality.

The purposes of this study were to measure the validity and reliability of
the NLit among primary care patients with nutrition-related chronic illness and to
identify the extent to which nutrition literacy is associated with diet quality. It
was hypothesized that the NLit would stratify participants by nutrition literacy and
that those with higher nutrition literacy would demonstrate higher diet quality than
patients with lower nutrition literacy.

METHODS
Study design
This instrument validation study was conducted at an urban University
Medical Center in the Midwest. All participants were recruited and data was
collected between January 2015 and July 2016.

Participants and Recruitment
Participants were recruited using a variety of approaches including by
telephone outreach to an existing patient registry, by flyer and invitations to
patients in waiting rooms of 2 University-affiliated safety net clinics and 2
primary care clinics, and by campus broadcast email. Eligible participants were
over 18 years of age, could speak and read in English, and self-reported a
current diagnosis of diabetes, hyperlipidemia, hypertension, or
overweight/obesity. These conditions were targeted based on high population
frequency and because they comprise a large portion of nutrition education
encounters in clinical practice. Ineligibility criteria included overt
psychiatric illness, visual acuity insufficient to read the testing instrument,
cognitive impairment, or weight of 500 pounds or more (due to scale limit of the
research facility). Participants were compensated up to $40 in gift cards for
completing both study visits.

The University’s Institutional Review Board approved the study,
all subjects provided written informed consent, and all procedures were in
accordance with the ethical standards described in the Declaration of
Helsinki.

Measures
All surveys were completed online or in print, based on participant
preference and level of comfort with technology. Participants completed a brief
demographic survey, followed by the Nutrition Literacy Assessment Instrument
(NLit), and the Diet History Questionnaire II (DHQII)35. Participants returned for a second visit
approximately 1 month later to complete the NLit a second time. Participants
completed the NLit, either online or in print, in a quiet exam room with
research personnel present to ensure outside resources were not consulted while
answering the questions.

Nutrition Literacy
Following the pilot test of the instrument in breast cancer
patients33 the
NLit was revised by the research team for the nutrition-related chronic
disease population and reviewed by 4 experts in nutrition education and 1
psychometrician, in which it demonstrated an acceptable Scale Content
Validity Index of 0.90. After suggested revisions, 12 patients with at least
1 of the targeted nutrition-related chronic diseases (hypertension,
hyperlipidemia, diabetes, and overweight/obesity) from primary care clinics
provided feedback through cognitive interviews, resulting in additional
changes to improve the clarity of the format and content for the target
patient population36. The
resulting NLit contained 66 items and covered six subscales including
Nutrition &amp; Health, Energy Sources in Food, Household Food
Measurements, Food Label &amp; Numeracy, Food Groups, and Consumer
Skills. Example items and excerpts of the NLit are provided in Figure 1.

Diet Quality
Diet quality was measured by the Healthy Eating Index-2010
(HEI-2010)3, which
is a metric used to assign a quality score based upon comparison of the
reported dietary intake to the recommendations outlined in the Dietary
Guidelines for Americans37. The “past year, with portion size” version
of the DHQII is a 153-item food frequency questionnaire validated to
estimate nutrient intake and is distributed freely by the National Cancer
Institute (NCI)35. Using
the nutrient data generated by the DHQII, an HEI-2010 score was calculated
using methods provided by the NCI38. The total scores of HEI-2010 ranges 0–100,
with higher scores indicating higher diet quality.

Body Mass Index
Participants were measured for height and weight using clinic
standard procedures39, and
these data were used to calculate body mass index (BMI) based on weight
(kg)/height (m2).

Data Analysis
The relationship of constructs via subscales of NLit and its respective
items was analyzed by Item Response Theory via binary confirmatory factor
analysis (CFA) in order to measure factor validity as well as reliability.
Binary CFA is a generalization of Rasch models40. The binary CFA analysis was conducted using
Classical and Bayesian Instrument Development (CBID) software, which ha s
comparable output to the Mplus software41,42. When fitting
the model for each subscale, we used a 1-factor model and treated the response
of each item as a binary variable (correct or incorrect). The model fit was
evaluated by 2 statistical fit indexes: Comparative Fit Index (CFI&gt;.90)
and Root Mean Square Error of Approximation (RMSEA&lt;.06)43. In addition to classic CFA,
the CBID software calculated a CFA-based measure of reliability called entired
reliability and associated 95% interval was estimated with the output
obtained by binary CFA44.
Entire reliability is better than Cronbach’s alpha since the latter is a
lower bound estimate of reliability. The interpretation of reliability was
according to Shrout’s adjectives, which is: 0.00–0.10 as
virtually none, 0.11–0.40 as slight, 0.41–0.60 as fair,
0.61–0.80 as moderate, and 0.81–1.0 as substantial
reliability45.

Test-retest reliability, or stability of survey items, was conducted to
determine if questions were answered the same after a 1 month interval by the
same people using both Pearson’s correlation and the intraclass
correlation coefficient.

Sample Size
Many references on classical instrument development46 recommend 10 subjects per
item (therefore requiring 10× participants for the project). A more
formal justification of the sample size was examined using a Monte Carlo
simulation study for the CFA. We performed the simulation using the Mplus
software at various sample sizes (n=50, 100, 200, 300, 400, &amp; 500).
At each of these sample sizes we performed 500 simulations and examined the
estimate of the standard deviation of estimates and average standard error.
First, as the sample size gets larger the errors get smaller. Second, as
sample size gets larger the standard errors are very close to standard
deviation of estimates. This gave us confidence that at n=400 we would get
correct inferences from the CFA. This simulation also showed that increasing
the sample size bigger than n=400 had diminishing returns of reduction in
standard deviations, consistent with the cited reference above.

Because there is no standard for measuring nutrition literacy and
health literacy represents importantly different constructs than nutrition
literacy, diet quality (HEI-2010) was considered a convergent construct of
nutrition literacy in that both constructs were expected to trend in the
same direction. Linear regression tests were used to determine significant
(p &lt;0.05) associations between NLit total score, HEI-2010, and other
factors selected in step-wise fashion. Independent variables in the models
included continuous variables (NLit scores, age, and BMI) and categorical
variables (ethnicity, gender, income, education, previous consultation with
a dietitian, and self-reported hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and/or
diabetes) with HEI-2010 as the dependent variable. Similarly, linear
regression tests were used to determine significant associations between
each NLit domain score, HEI-2010, and other factors selected in step-wise
fashion.

Two items were removed from the long form resulting in a 64 item
NLit. One item was removed due to a change in nutrition recommendations
(“A healthy diet is low in saturated fat,___, sodium, and foods with
added sugar.” [correct answer: cholesterol]) and another item had
negative factor loading (“If portions are equal, which food provides
the best nutrition?” [correct answer: whole potato; incorrect
answer: oven reds frozen potatoes]. All analyses of the 64-item tool were
performed with these omissions. With the goal of achieving a shorter set of
items, items with the lowest “estimate” (e.g. item to domain
correlation) in each domain were removed and subscale reliability was
subsequently recalculated. If the subscale’s overall reliability was
too low (&lt;0.80), all items that positively contributed to
reliability were retained. For example, the 3 lowest reliabilities from
items retained was 0.127, 0.330, and 0.436 respectively. While it could be
argued that the lowest be removed (0.127), removal would result in fruit
(i.e. strawberries) not represented in the subscale. The end result was a
short form NLit (42 items) that omits the least reliable items out from the
long form (64 items). Pearson’s correlation coefficient was used to
compare scoring results between 64-item and 42-item versions.

Scoring thresholds were determined post hoc using regression
analysis of NLit 64-item quintile scores as related to HEI-2010 quintile
scores, and were chosen based upon HEI-2010 percentiles seen in the original
validation study3 as well
as Reedy et al’s study of diet quality indices and
mortality47.

RESULTS
A total of 445 men and women consented to participate in the study, and 429
had complete NLit surveys for at least 1 visit. Subjects missing ≥ 10 NLit
items were excluded from the final analysis (n= 16 visit 1; n=65 visit 2). Of these,
402 had complete DHQ II surveys and 380 completed the NLit at a subsequent visit.
Although a majority of the sample were educated females, there was diversity in race
(37% African American), ethnicity (11% Hispanic), and income
(24% &lt; $25,000 annual household income). The majority of the sample
was obese (mean BMI = 34.9 kg/m2), and hypertension was the most common
reported chronic disease diagnosis after overweight/obesity. Completing the NLit
required 25 minutes on average. Selected characteristics of the sample are provided
in Table 1.

Results of the confirmatory factor analysis demonstrated substantial factor
validity and reliability (0.97, 95% CI = 0.96 – 0.98) for the
combined subscale NLit. Analysis of the subscales demonstrates substantial factor
validity and reliability for 5 of 6 subscales, while Consumer Skills demonstrated
moderate factor reliability with a confidence interval that spans moderate to
substantial (0.75, 95% CI = 0.68–0.83). Test-retest reliability was
substantial overall (r=0.88, 95% CI = 0.85–0.90) while subscale
test-retest reliability varied between fair to substantial reliability. Scores on
the 64-item and 42-item NLits were substantially correlated overall (r=0.96, CI =
0.96–0.97) and for each subscale (subscale correlation ranged r=0.86 for
Household Food Measurement to r=0.96 for Food Label and Numeracy). Reliability and
factor validity statistics are presented in Table
2 for the 64-item NLit and Table 3
for the 42-item NLit.

Mean HEI-2010 scores were 63.9 (SD = 12.39) and ranged between 29.2
– 89.9. Multiple linear regression indicates a positive and significant
relationship between 64-item NLit scores and HEI-2010 (R2 =0.10; p
&lt; .0001) as shown in Table 4. Results
were similar for multiple linear regression of the relationship between 42-item NLit
scores and HEI-2010 (R2 =0.09; p&lt;.0001). Factors considered that
were not significant in the model included race, income, and previous consultation
with a registered dietitian. Although age, BMI, diabetes, and education attainment
all contributed significantly to the model, NLit score was the most significant
predictor (β=0.30, p=0.003; β=0.16, p=0.004; 64-item and 42-item
respectively).

Domain scores that were significantly related to HEI-2010 included Nutrition
&amp; Health (β=0.13, p=0.004), Energy Sources in Food (β=0.19,
p&lt;0.001), Food Label &amp; Numeracy (β=0.13, p=0.011), Food
Groups (β=0.12, p=0.025), &amp; Consumer Skills (β=0.18,
p&lt;0.001). In the step-wise multiple linear regression, when age, BMI,
diabetes diagnosis, and education were factored into the model, Energy Sources in
Food and Consumer Skills remained significant (p&lt;0.05) after Bonferroni
adjustment.

Scoring Thresholds
Three scoring categories emerged when comparing the linear relationship
between NLit scores and HEI-2010 scores. NLit scores of 44/64 correct or below
were associated with HEI-2010 scores &lt;60.4, which corresponds with the
lowest quintile of HEI-2010 scores associated with higher risk of all-cause,
cardiovascular, and cancer mortality47. NLit scores of 58 correct or higher were associated
with HEI-2010 scores &gt;65.5, which corresponds with the 90th
percentile of population HEI-2010 in Guenther’s validation
study3. Thus, we
suggest that scores ≤44/64 correct may be interpreted as
“likelihood of poor nutrition literacy”; scores of 45–57
correct may be interpreted as “possibility of poor nutrition
literacy”; and scores ≥58 may be interpreted as
“possibility of good nutrition literacy.” Predicted HEI-2010
scores from NLit scores and interpretation for long and short versions of the
NLit are presented in Table 5.

DISCUSSION
This is the first study to test the reliability and validity of a tool for
comprehensively measuring nutrition literacy in an adult primary care population
with nutrition-related chronic disease. The NLit demonstrates substantial factor
validity and entire reliability, both overall and by domain, substantial overall
test-retest reliability and acceptable test-retest reliability by domains.
Additionally, convergent validity of the NLit is demonstrated by the strong
relationship found between nutrition literacy scores and diet quality scores
(HEI-2010).

Based on formative research completed prior to development of the NLit
indicating the time required to assess nutrition literacy was a barrier to
measurement in practice31, we
identified a shortened version that retains adequate validity and reliability and is
substantially correlated with the longer version. Although not measured here,
removing one-third of the items could theoretically reduce the average time for
assessment by one-third (9 minutes), or require approximately 16 minutes on average
for measurement. Availability of both versions allows researchers and clinicians
greater flexibility in choosing which version best meets their needs.

This work builds upon the existing tools used to measure health literacy
and/or nutrition literacy by applying techniques used to measure print literacy in
established health literacy tools24 to the nutrition context while also expanding the constructs of
nutrition literacy beyond food label numeracy26. Some tools that seek to measure nutrition knowledge have
been validated in college students, which offers the advantage of establishing
validity by using nutrition or nursing majors as comparison scorers30,48,49. Development and
validation of the NLit within the primary care population, however, is a clear
strength in this study to ensure the relevance and difficulty of the tool for the
adult primary care population. Because diet quality was evaluated as a comparison
construct that demonstrated a positive linear relationship, we might predict that
higher nutrition literacy, which is the immediate goal of nutrition education, would
subsequently lead to higher diet quality. The approach to use an outcome as the
comparison measure for validity is novel in the context of health literacy tools
which have established validity through measures of reading comprehension and/or
mathematical competency23,24,28, or these tools have served as the comparison measure for
additional tools26. While HEI-2010
is not considered a clinical marker, and there are no established thresholds for
good or bad diet quality, the substantially lower risk for all-cause,
cardiovascular, and cancer mortality in those with the highest quintile of intake in
Reedy’s study substantiates the health benefit of recommended dietary
patterns47.

Nutrition literacy was the most significant predictor of diet quality in
this study, which underscores the importance of incorporating nutrition literacy
concepts in efforts to improve the diet quality of adults. While research attention
in this area has largely focused on nutrition label literacy18,22,50, our data
demonstrate that identifying food sources of the macronutrients (Energy Sources in
Food) and the ability to navigate food and nutrition products and marketing to
choose between similar options (Consumer Skills) are two skills that have greater
importance for choosing a healthy diet than an ability to read a food label.
Although diet quality was not reported, a related study of parent nutrition
knowledge and label use found that nutrition label literacy and nutrition knowledge
was related to parental blood lipids, but only nutrition knowledge was related to
child adiposity51.

Increasing age and lower educational attainment are factors consistently
related to low health literacy and health outcomes52, consistent with our findings here. It is also
unsurprising that our multivariate model predicting diet quality accounted for only
10% of the variance because there are many components that theoretically
drive healthy eating that were not measured in this study. This list may include
behavioral factors such as attitudes, subjective norms, perceived behavioral
control, behavioral intention, motivation, and self-efficacy53–56, food literacy57 and environmental issues such as healthy food
access58,59. While models have emerged to include health
literacy behavioral models60,61, theoretical models including
nutrition literacy in the pathway of a healthy diet are lacking.

There are important limitations to this study. First, diet quality was
measured using nutrient data obtained via a food frequency questionnaire, which
provides only reported intake, not measured. Bowen demonstrated that those with low
health literacy may struggle more to report accurate portion intake via food
frequency questionnaires62. Yet,
even inaccuracies in reporting could demonstrate poor understanding of nutrition
recommendations since people are more likely to report favorably on their dietary
intake63. Second, our
demographic data and HEI-2010 data suggest a sample bias toward higher than average
education and higher than average diet quality, respectively. The mean HEI-2010
scores of this sample fell between the 75th and 90th
percentiles of scores in the 2003–2004 NHANES nationally representative
sample used to validate HEI-20103,
indicating better reported diet quality than would be predicted for a general sample
of US adults. While our study included a diverse group in terms of race and chronic
disease, future studies of nutrition literacy should focus on assessing participants
for a broader range of educational attainment. Finally, as with any measurement
instrument, robust construct validity requires evidence from multiple studies,
requiring that the NLit be further tested in similar samples and in populations that
deviate from this sample.

A challenge to nutrition literacy research is that nutrition literacy is not
a static concept, in part because nutrition recommendations change rapidly. For
example, the development of the NLit has spanned three versions of the Dietary
Guidelines for Americans. These guidelines are required by law to be reviewed by a
voluntary appointed panel of leading nutrition experts every five years, leading to
new recommendations and often new food guides (e.g. the Food Guide Pyramid in 1992,
MyPyramid in 2005, and MyPlate in 2010). While these updates are important for
informing health promotion and disease prevention efforts as well as changing public
health program policies to better reflect the current science of food and nutrition,
it can be difficult for consumers to stay informed64. Although not as rapidly changing, the nutrition
facts panel on the food label has undergone recent changes that take effect
beginning in July 2018. For those who consult the food label when making purchasing
and/or consumption decisions, they will need to reorient themselves to the redesign.
What is more, food marketing efforts, such as the use of health claims to appeal to
health-conscious consumers, are often misunderstood65–67.
Thus, nutrition literacy measurement will need to adapt to the changing
recommendations, food guides, and product information.

* Model One is fitted by simple linear regression, and the only
predictor is the Nutrition Literacy Assessment Instrument (64 item);

** Model Two is fitted by multiple linear regression selected in
step-wise fashion. Nutrition Literacy Assessment Instrument (64-item), Age,
BMI, Diabetes status and Education level are all included in the model as
predictors;

^ p value for each parameter, which indicates whether
the predictor significantly contributes to the variability of the outcome
(HEI);

^^ : p value for the whole model, which indicates
whether the model is statistically significant;

a Nutrition Literacy Assessment Instrument is the average of the
summation of the NLit scores from each visit, and it serves as a continuous
predictor for HEI in Model One and Model Two;

b Age, BMI were collected at Visit 1 and they both serve as continuous
predictors for HEI in Model Two;

c Diabetes Diagnosis results and Education level were collected at
Visit 1 and both serve as discrete predictors for HEI in Model Two.

IMPLICATIONS FOR RESEARCH AND PRACTICE
The NLit is a reliable and valid tool for measuring nutrition literacy in
adults with nutrition-related chronic disease. This tool can serve as a critical
resource for the clinical, public health, and research communities for identifying
and seeking to improve nutrition literacy skills. Clearly, there is a need for more
research in nutrition literacy. Future research efforts should focus upon whether
identification of those with low nutrition literacy leads to more targeted nutrition
education and whether improved nutrition literacy leads to better diet quality.
While our data indicate correlation between nutrition literacy and diet quality,
future research is needed to determine effective methods for improving nutrition
literacy and whether these improvements result in higher diet quality.
