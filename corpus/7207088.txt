atment of various diseases has been
extensively acknowledged. The idea of functional foods is attaining recognition
nowadays as consumers are trying to improve their health by natural means. It has
been observed that such foods promote one or more functions in the body apart from
regular dietary effects. Studies related to development of healthier and functional
meat and meat products would prove beneficial to the meat industry and eventually
the consumers as the relation involving diet and chronic disease avoidance continues
to rise (Kandeepan et al., 2007).
      Meat and its products supply good quality proteins, essential fatty acids, minerals,
vitamins, and additional nutrients, but they are deficient in dietary fibre.
Consistent eating of meat products is being linked with a range of health problems
like colon cancer, obesity, and cardiovascular ailments (Larsson and Wolk, 2006; Tarrant, 1998).
      Lipid oxidation, autoxidation, and microbial proliferation are the main reasons for
quality decline in meat and meat products. Changes in poultry meat due to oxidative
rancidity may differ considerably from slight decrease in freshness to considerable
flavour changes, colour losses, and structural degradation of proteins. Rancidity
process is started due to vulnerability to the enzyme lypoxygenase, metalloprotein
catalysts, heat, ionizing radiation, light, and metal ions (Daker et al., 2008). Meat processing procedures like mincing
and cooking distort membranes of muscle cells promoting the interaction of
unsaturated lipids with prooxidant substances like non-haem iron. This escalates
lipid oxidation resulting in rancidity which deteriorates the quality of meat
products (Tichivangana and Morrissey,
1985).
      Synthetic antioxidants have been used in meat and poultry products to inhibit lipid
oxidation. But they have come under watch because of their possible toxicological
effects (Naveena et al., 2008; Nu&#xF1;ez de Gonzalez et al., 2008).
Therefore, significance of natural source of antioxidants for application in meat
products has increased in recent years.
      Pomegranate peel and pomegranate seed/aril bagasse are main byproducts of pomegranate
juice industry (Jalal et al., 2018).
Pomegranate peel is major source of bioactive compounds like phenolics, flavonoids,
ellagitannins, and proanthocyanidin compounds. Antioxidant and antibacterial quality
of peel of pomegranate in in-vitro experimental models have been documented.
Pomegranate peel extracts curb the growth of many food borne pathogens (Agourram et al., 2013; Al-Zoreky, 2009). Pomegranate seed/bagasse have a variety of
nutraceutical compounds like sterols, &#x3B3;-tocopherol, punicic acid, and
hydroxyl benzoic acids (Liu et al., 2009).
Pomegranate seed extracts exhibited antidiarrheal and antioxidant bioactivities
(Singh et al., 2002). Bhol and Bosco (2013) found that pomegranate
aril bagasse and pomegranate whole fruit bagasse are rich source of dietary fibre.
Due to presence of valuable pharmaceutical and nutritional compounds, these
byproducts can be better utilized in food industry in place of being exploited as
feed for animals or marketable cosmetic products (Liu et al., 2009).
      Poultry industry is attaining more significance worldwide in present times due to its
better consumer recognition and freedom from religious hindrances. Huge growth of
fast food market has escalated ready to eat snack foods demand. Chicken patty is one
of the favourite comminuted products which have a noticeable position because of its
distinctive flavour and palatability (Raut et al.,
2011). In light of above information, this study was undertaken to
develop chicken meat patties by incorporating powder and aqueous extracts of
pomegranate peel and aril bagasse, and study the effect of their addition on quality
characteristics and shelf life of developed products.

      Materials and Methods

        Preparation of pomegranate peel and bagasse powder and their extracts
        Pomegranate peels were collected from local market juice shop. Pomegranate aril
bagasse was obtained after extraction of juice from pomegranate fruit. Both the
byproducts were separately washed with clean water. They were squeezed through
muslin cloth to remove extra water and dried in hot air drier at a temperature
of about 50&#xB0;C&#x2212;55&#xB0;C for about 2 d. After complete drying,
both the dried products were ground to fine powder in a grinder, packed in
polythene bags separately and stored at &#x2212;18&#xB1;2&#xB0;C for further
use.
        For preparing extracts, 10 g of each type of dried powder was mixed in 100 mL of
distilled water separately. Both the mixtures were incubated for overnight at
room temperature. Each type of mixture was filtered through muslin cloth and the
filtrate was retained for use in chicken meat patties. Fresh extracts were
prepared each time for use during product development and test procedures.

        Slaughtering and dressing of chicken
        Birds were slaughtered and dressed following the established procedure in the
experimental slaughter house of the Department. The dressed chickens were
deboned manually, washed and packaged in low density polyethylene bags and
stored at &#x2212;18&#xB1;2&#xB0;C till further use. The frozen meat chunks
were drawn according to necessity and thawed overnight in a refrigerator
(4&#xB1;2&#xB0;C) for further use.

        Preparation of control and treated meat patties
        Deboned frozen meat was cut into small pieces and minced in an electrical mincer
(3 mm plate) (Mado Primus Meat Mincer MEW-613, Dr. Froeb India Pvt., Noida,
India). In control meat patties, 100 g of minced meat was taken to which sodium
chloride, sodium tripolyphosphate, sodium nitrite, spice mix, condiments (ginger
and garlic in ratio of 1:1), bread crumbs, water, egg liquid, and fat were added
in suitable proportion (Table 1) and
blended with the minced meat in a mixer (Select 600; Morphyrichards food
processor, Mumbai, India) for 4 to 5 min. Treatments consisted of addition of
butylated hydroxytoluene (BHT), pomegranate peel and bagasse powder and their
aqueous extracts separately to minced meat. Approximately 60 g of meat emulsion
was hand moulded into patty shape using a petri dish. Patties were prepared by
baking in a preheated oven at a temperature of 160&#xB0;C for 35 min (20 min
first side and 15 min second side). Both control and treated patties were
packaged in low density polythene bags and subjected to physico-chemical,
nutritional, instrumental colour, and texture analysis. Patties were also stored
under refrigerated storage (4&#xB1;2&#xB0;C) conditions and physico-chemical
and microbiological quality of the products were analysed at a regular interval
of 4 d upto 16 d of storage.

              Chicken meat patties incorporated with 2 g dried pomegranate peel
powder (PPP), 4 g dried pomegranate aril baggase powder (PABP), 6 g
dried pomegranate peel powder aqueous extract (PPAE) and 9 g dried
pomegranate aril bagasse powder aqueous extract (PABAE),
respectively.

              BHT, butylated hydroxytoluene.

        Total phenolic content
        Folin Ciocalteu&#x2019;s technique was followed to determine total phenolic
content. Absorbance was measured at 750 nm by UV visible spectrophotometer (G 10
S UV-VIS; Thermo Fisher Scientific India Pvt., Mumbai, India). For standard,
gallic acid was used and results were calculated as mg of gallic acid equivalent
(GAE)/100 g of dry mass (Bhalodia et al.,
2011).

        Physico-chemical parameters
        The pH of chicken patties was estimated with pH meter (Cyber Scan pH 510; Eutech
Instruments, Thermo Fisher Scientific India Pvt., Mumbai, India) following the
procedure of Trout et al. (1992). Control
and treated emulsions stability were estimated using the method of Baliga and Madaiah (1970). For cooking
yield, the weight of raw and cooked patties was measured and yield was expressed
as percentage. Water holding capacity (WHC) was determined as per the procedure
of Wardlaw et al. (1973). Thiobarbituric
acid (TBA) value of patties was estimated as per the method of Witte et al. (1970). Trichloroacetic acid
extract of meat samples was mixed with TBA reagent. The contents were placed in
boiling water bath and optical density was determined at 540 nm. TBA value was
calculated as mg malonaldehyde/kg of sample.

        Proximate composition
        Moisture, protein, fat, ash, and crude fibre content of chicken meat patties were
estimated by standard procedure of AOAC
(2005). Finally chopped sample of meat was dried in hot air oven
(JSGW, Ambala, India), cooled in desiccator and loss in weight was expressed as
moisture content of the sample. Protein was estimated using Kjeldahl digestion
method. The fat content of samples was determined by solvent extraction method
using petroleum ether (60&#xB0;C to 80&#xB0;C) as solvent. Ashing was done
in a muffle furnace (Yorco, Yorco sales Pvt., New Delhi, India) set at
550&#xB0;C to determine ash content of samples. For crude fibre content, fat
free samples were subjected to acid and alkali digestion. The residue remaining
after digestion was weighed and subjected to ashing. Difference in weight was
calculated as crude fibre.

        Texture profile analysis
        The textural properties of patties were evaluated by the method of Bourne (1978) using TA.HD plus twin column
texture analyser (Stable Micro Systems, Godalming, UK) equipped with the
exponent software (version 5,1,1,0 Lite).
        Samples of 2 cm3 size were compressed (by 70 mm compression plate, 50
kg load cell and the test speed of 2 mm/s) to 50% of their initial
height. Between two compression cycles, 5 s time interval was given to obtain
force time deformation curves. Hardness (N), cohesiveness, springiness,
gumminess (N), and chewiness (N) of the samples were analyzed.

        Firmness and toughness
        The force required to shear a 1cm3 thick sample of cooked chicken meat
patties transversely was analysed using Warner-Bratzler shear probe of texture
analyser (TA.HD plus, Stable Micro Systems). A force time curve was obtained.
Firmness (N) was the maximum shear force required to cut the sample. Toughness
(N-s) was the total shear energy (i.e. work of shear) calculated as the area
under force time curve from start to the end of the shear test.

        Instrumental colour analysis
        The colour scores of chicken patties were measured as CIE Lab, L* (lightness), a*
(redness), and b* (yellowness) using a chroma meter (Konica Minolta Sensing,
Osaka, Japan) with 8 mm orifice for measurement. The equipment was standardized
with a white standard plate before measurement.

        Microbiological evaluation
        Total plate count (TPC), psychrotrophic, and thermophilic counts of chicken
patties were estimated during refrigerated storage (APHA, 2001).

        Statistical analysis
        The data acquired were evaluated by analysis of variance. For fresh products,
one-way analysis of variance and for refrigerated stored products, two-way
analysis of variance were performed. Duncan&#x2019;s test was performed using
SPSS version 16 (SPSS, Chicago, IL, USA) to determine the significant difference
in the mean values at 5% significance level.

      Results and Discussion

        Total phenolic content
        A small quantity of phenolic compounds were observed in control raw emulsion and
patties which was due to polyphenols provided by spices and condiments added to
chicken meat emulsion (Table 2).
Polyphenolic content and antioxidant capacity of different spices have been well
established (Pellegrini et al., 2006;
Zheng and Wang, 2001). Addition of
BHT, pomegranate peel and bagasse and their extracts to chicken meat resulted in
an appreciable increase in total phenolic content. Also, pomegranate by products
and their extracts treated patties had significantly higher phenolic content
than BHT treated patties. Pomegranate peel powder (PPP) treatment had
significantly higher phenolic content in comparison to pomegranate aril bagasse
powder (PABP) treatments. Similarly, peel extract treated emulsion and patties
had significantly higher phenolic content than bagasse extract treated emulsion
and patties, respectively. Higher phenolic content in peel treated emulsion and
patties in comparison to bagasse treated emulsion and patties was due to higher
total phenolic content in PPP (52.3 mg GAE/g) in comparison to PABP (30.1 mg
GAE/g). A number of research workers have demonstrated higher phenolic content
in pomegranate peel in comparison to its pulp and bagasse. Findings of present
research work are in agreement with previous studies. Li et al. (2006) revealed that peel tissues of pomegranate
normally contain higher quantity of phenolics than its pulp. Sultana et al. (2008) reported that total
phenol and total flavonoid content of PPP were higher in comparison to
pomegranate aril bagasse and whole fruit bagasse powder. Devatkal and Naveena (2010) also reported higher total
phenolic content in pomegranate rind powder (PRP) in comparison to pomegranate
seed powder (PSP). Within a particular byproduct, powder treatment had higher
phenolic content in comparison to respective extract treatment. Higher amount of
phenolics in powder treated emulsion and patties in comparison to respective
extract treated emulsion and patties might be due to less extraction of
phenolics in aqueous extract. Separation of phenolic compounds from their innate
structure is complex due to their heterogenicity and vulnerability to oxidation
and hydrolysis (Naczk and Shahidi, 2004).
Kind of solvent, proportion of solid to liquid, extraction temperature, and peel
particles size significantly affect antioxidant extraction (Ismail et al., 2012).

        Physico-chemical qualities of chicken meat emulsion and patties
        The pH of raw emulsion and cooked chicken patties did not vary significantly
between control and treatments, although a non-significantly lower pH was
noticed in pomegranate byproducts and their extract incorporated patties (Table 2). WHC increased significantly in
pomegranate by products i.e. PPP and PABP incorporated patties in comparison to
control. PABP treated patties had significantly highest WHC value among all
treatments. Higher WHC in PPP and PABP treated patties might be due to presence
of dietary fibre in pomegranate peel and bagasse powder which has been reported
to increase the WHC (Cofrades et al.,
2000). Viuda-Martos et al.
(2012) reported that pomegranate bagasse powder co-product exhibited
WHC equal to 4.86 times of its own weight. Akhtar
et al. (2015) found that incorporation of 3% PRP in raw beef
sausage improved their WHC.
        Emulsion stability and cooking yield of PABP treated patties was significantly
higher than control. As discussed earlier, higher cooking yield of PABP treated
patties was due to presence of dietary fibres which increases cooking yield
because of their water and fat binding attributes (Cofrades et al., 2000). PPP treated patties also had
dietary fibre, but it did not result in significant increase in cooking yield,
although a non-significantly higher yield than control was observed in PPP
treated patties. This might be due to lower level of PPP used in patties. Abdel Fattah et al. (2016) also reported
better cooking yield in beef burgers incorporated with PPP. Addition of BHT and
pomegranate by product aqueous extracts (pomegranate peel powder aqueous extract
[PPAE] and pomegranate aril bagasse powder aqueous extract [PABAE]) did not
result in any significant effect on WHC, emulsion stability, and cooking yield
of chicken meat patties.

        Addition of pomegranate peel and aril bagasse powder contributed to significant
decline in moisture content of patties (Table
3). This was due to replacement of meat with dried peel and aril
bagasse containing very low moisture. The moisture content of dried peel powder
and dried aril bagasse powder was 11.06% and 5.55%, respectively.
El-Nashi et al. (2015) revealed that
addition of PPP to beef sausage contributed to significant decline in moisture
content. Powder treated patties had significantly lower moisture content in
comparison to respective extract treated patties.

              Moisture, crude fat, crude protein, crude fibre and ash content for
pomegranate fruit peel powder were 11.03%, 1.42%,
6.83%, 15.80%, respectively.

              Moisture, crude fat, crude protein, crude fibre and ash content for
pomegranate aril bagasse powder were 5.55%, 5.38%,
16.86%, 17.42%, 32.32%, and 3.22%,
respectively.

        Protein content of control and treated patties did not varied remarkably.
Addition of pomegranate aril bagasse powder contributed to significant increase
in fat content and treatment PABP had significantly higher fat content than
control. Higher fat content in PABP treated patties was due to more retention of
fat and presence of higher amount of fat in pomegranate aril bagasse powder
(16.86%). Earlier, &#xD6;zg&#xFC;l-Y&#xFC;cel (2005) revealed that pomegranate
seeds are a plentiful source of total lipids. Ash content of pomegranate peel
and bagasse powder treated patties was significantly higher in comparison to
control which was due to higher ash content in PPP (4.03%) and PABP
(3.22%). A small quantity of crude fibre was observed in control chicken
patties which was attributable to dietary fibre provided by spices and
condiments incorporated in raw emulsion. A significant increase in crude fibre
content in PPP and PABP patties was observed which was because of higher crude
fibre content in pomegranate peel and aril bagasse powder. PABP patties also had
significantly higher crude fibre content in comparison to PPP patties. This was
due to more amount of PABP (4 g) incorporated in chicken meat in comparison to
PPP (2 g). Also, higher amount of crude fibre in PABP (32.32%) in
comparison to PPP (15.80%) contributed to significantly higher crude
fibre content in PABP treated patties. Rowayshed
et al. (2013) revealed that the PPP and PSP are considered as good
source of crude fibre. Bhol and Bosco
(2013) observed a substantial increase in fibre content in bread with
rise in level of pomegranate bagasse powder. Addition of BHT, PPAE, and PABAE
did not influence the proximate composition of chicken patties.

        Instrumental colour analysis
        Incorporation of pomegranate by products and their extracts contributed to a
decline in lightness and significant decline in relation to control was noticed
in PPP and PABP treated patties (Table
4). Significant decrease in lightness in these treatments might be due to
dark colour contributed by pomegranate peel and bagasse. Gonz&#xE1;lez and Enr&#xED;quez (1994) reported that
colour is influenced by various factors, but drying process in particular
influence the colour. Pulp is exposed to high temperature during its drying,
which leads to enzymatic and non-enzymatic browning resulting in darkening of
the product. Addition of BHT, powders, and extracts did not influence the
redness and yellowness values of chicken patties.

        Texture profile, firmness and toughness of chicken meat patties
        Texture profile analysis of control and treated patties revealed a significant
increase in hardness of PPP and PABP treated patties (Table 5). Higher hardness values in these treatments might
be due to hardness and rigidity contributed by pomegranate peel and bagasse.
Lower moisture content in these treatments might have contributed to higher
hardness. Yadav et al. (2016) also
documented an increase in hardness scores of dried apple pomace added chicken
sausage. PPP patties had significantly higher hardness than PABP treated
patties. Gumminess score of PPP treated patties were significantly higher in
comparison to control, which was due to their higher hardness values. Chewiness
values of both the extract treated patties were significantly lower in
comparison to PPP treated patties, which was due to their significantly lower
hardness value and non-significantly lower springiness values. Pomegranate
byproducts powder addition resulted in an increase in firmness and toughness,
and significant rise in relation to control was observed in PPP incorporated
patties. Addition of BHT, PPAE, and PABAE did not affect texture profile,
firmness, and toughness of chicken patties.

        Physico-chemical and microbiological quality of pomegranate fruit byproducts
treated chicken patties during refrigerated storage

          pH values
          pH of control and treated patties did not vary considerably during
refrigerated storage (Table 6). There
was a modest decrease in pH of chicken meat patties during initial days of
refrigeration. Subsequently, pH increased on 12 d and 16 d of storage.
Lactic acid bacteria multiply in the beginning, which leads to
disintegration of sugar into acids. Subsequently, bacterial deamination of
proteins occurs which raises the pH of the product (Jay, 1996).

                BHT, 100 ppm butylated hydroxytoluene; PPP, 2 g pomegranate peel

aril bagasse powder aqueous extract.

                Means with different small superscripts within a column and
capital superscripts within a row for a particular parameter
differ significantly (p&lt;0.05).

          TBA value
          TBA value of control and treated patties increased significantly during
refrigerated storage. However, TBA values of PPP and PABP treated chicken
patties were significantly lower than control throughout the storage period.
TBA values of BHT, PPAE, and PABAE were also lower than control during
storage. Significant difference was observed from 8 d onward in PPAE and
PABAE treated patties and 12 d onward in BHT treated patties. Bioactive
compounds like phenols and flavonoids present in pomegranate peel and
bagasse provided antioxidant effect and inhibited lipid oxidation in chicken
patties resulting in lower rise in TBA values in these treatments. The
results indicate that pomegranate peel, bagasse, and extracts provided
better protection against rise in TBA value in comparison to BHT, and can be
used as natural antioxidant sources in chicken meat patties in place of
synthetic antioxidants. Decrease in TBA value of meat and meat products due
to antioxidant effect of pomegranate fruit byproducts, and their extracts
has been reported previously by various research workers. El-Gharably and Ashoush (2011) and
Naveena et al. (2008) observed
that PPP improved the storage stability of meat products during
refrigeration by reducing the rate of lipid oxidation. Devatkal et al. (2010) also observed a significant
reduction in thiobarbituric acid reactive substances (TBARS) values of goat
meat patties treated with the extracts of PRP and PSP as compared to control
during refrigerated storage. Abdel Fattah et
al. (2016) reported lower TBARS value in PPP incorporated beef
burgers in comparison to control on 12 d of storage.

          Microbiological status
          TPC, psychrotrophic count, and thermophilic count of control and treated
patties increased significantly with increase in storage duration in all the
treatments (Table 7). The rate of
increase was less in pomegranate byproducts and their extract treated
patties. Inhibitory effect of bioactive and phenolic compounds present in
pomegranate peel, bagasse, and their extracts resulted in significantly
lower TPC in treated patties in comparison to control at the end of storage.
Maximum inhibitory effect on growth of microbes was noticed in PPP treated
patties resulting in significantly lowest TPC at the end of storage. PPP
treated patties also had significantly lower psychrotrophic and thermophilic
counts in comparison to control patties at the end of storage. Results
indicate that pomegranate fruit by products such as peel, aril bagasse, and
their extracts possess antimicrobial activity. Al-Zoreky (2009) observed that pomegranate extract
intervened with production of bacterial proteins. Chandralekha et al. (2012) observed a significant
decrease in standard plate count of 5% rind powder incorporated
chicken meatball in comparison to control during refrigerated storage.

      Conclusion
      Incorporation of pomegranate fruit byproducts in the form of peel powder, aril
bagasse powder, and their aqueous extracts improved nutritional value of chicken
patties by increasing their total phenolics content. TBA values of powder and
extract treated patties were lower in comparison to control and BHT treated patties
during refrigerated storage. This study indicates that pomegranate fruit byproducts
and their extracts can be used as a replacement of synthetic antioxidants such as
butylated hydroxytoluene for development of chicken meat patties. Both the powders
provided additional nutritional benefit by increasing crude fibre content of patties
while bagasse powder also increased their cooking yield. Microbial counts in powder
and extract treated patties were lower than control during refrigerated storage.
Best antimicrobial effect was observed in PPP treated patties.
