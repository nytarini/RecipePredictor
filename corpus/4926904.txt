        Considering the evidence of flaxseed and its defatted flaxseed meal (DFM) for human health benefits, response surface methodology (RSM) based on three level four factor central composite rotatable design (CCRD) was employed for the development of DFM incorporated corn &#x2013; rice flour blend based extruded snack. The effect of DFM fortification (7.5&#x2013;20&#xA0;%), moisture content of feed (14&#x2013;20&#xA0;%, wb), extruder barrel temperature (115&#x2013;135&#xA0;&#xB0;C) and screw speed (300&#x2013;330 RPM) on expansion ratio (ER), breaking strength (BS), overall acceptability (OAA) score and water solubility index (WSI) of extrudates were investigated using central composite rotatable design (CCRD). Significant regression models explained the effect of considered variables on all responses. DFM incorporation level was found to be most significant independent variable affecting on extrudates characteristics followed by extruder barrel temperature and then screw rpm. Feed moisture content did not affect extrudates characteristics. As DFM level increased (7.5&#xA0;% to 20&#xA0;%), ER and OAA value decreased. However, BS and WSI values were found to increase with increase in DFM level. Based on the defined criteria for numerical optimization, the combination for the production of DFM incorporated extruded snack with desired sensory attributes was achieved by incorporating 10&#xA0;% DFM (replacing rice flour in flour blend) and by keeping 20&#xA0;% moisture content, 312 screw rpm and 125&#xA0;&#xB0;C barrel temperature.
