The effects of formulation of leavened bread by using varying levels (for 50&#xA0;g base flour) of soy flour&#x2013;barnyard millet blends (with 5.74, 6.25, 7, 7.75 and 8.26&#xA0;g of soy flour), yeast (1.83, 2, 2.25, 2.5 and 2.67&#xA0;g) and salt (0.63, 0.8, 1.05, 1.30 and 1.47&#xA0;g) on textural, colour and specific volume were determined. A central composite rotatable design of response surface methodology was used to plan the experiments. The second order models obtained were observed to be statistically significant and capable of demonstrating the effects input variables on responses. All the textural properties were affected significantly by amount of soy flour and yeast in the dough. Soy flour had a significant effect on the colour of the bread making it more brown. Interaction of soy flour and yeast affected the specific volume to maximum extent. Two-tailed t test established that the efficacy of the models as no significant was observed between the predicted and the actual values.
