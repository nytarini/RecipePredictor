        Cactus pear fruit consists of the peel, seeds and pulp. The peel is a major waste in cactus pear pulp based products accounting about 37.72% of the fruit weight. The aim of this study was to utilized and characterized the physicochemical and rheological properties of biscuits substituted with extracted cactus pear peel (CPP) and alcohol-insoluble solids (AIS) from cactus pear (Opuntia ficus-indica). To prepare AIS, peels were shredded and dropped in ethanol (70%) for 15&#xA0;min. The mixture was boiled at 70&#xA0;&#xB0;C for 30&#xA0;min, filtered and washed with ethanol 70% and the washing repeated until no sugars. The residue was washed and dried at room temperature. Changes in physiochemical and rheological properties of extracted CPP and AIS from cactus pear to qualify determine their use in the production of them to produce a fiber-rich food product. The water-holding capacity was 3.7&#xA0;ml/g for the peel and 1.5&#xA0;ml/g for the AIS, and the oil-holding capacity was approximately the same for both the CPP and AIS. The protein content was 3.5% for the CPP and 3.72% for the AIS. The CPP and AIS contained little fat (1.22% and 1.44%, respectively). Potassium and calcium in the AIS had the highest concentration, at 21.49&#xA0;g/kg and 44.04&#xA0;g/kg, respectively, and these minerals were found at 22.07&#xA0;g/kg and 16.66&#xA0;g/kg, respectively, in the CPP. The dominant phenolic compounds found in the CPP were pyrogallol, catechol, catechin, and alpha-coumaric acid. The results showed that the AIS contained pyrogallol (61.67&#xA0;ppm), benzoic acid (10.68&#xA0;ppm), vanillic acid (7.66&#xA0;ppm), catechin (4.65&#xA0;ppm) and salicylic acid (4.51&#xA0;ppm). The CPP was rich in glucose (25.95%) and fructose (21.36%) compared to the AIS. The sensory evaluation indicated that 7.5% dried cactus pear peel or 7.5% AIS can be successfully used in substitution of wheat flour biscuits. It could be conducted cactus pear as major by-product can be important for the industrial utilization.
