        Biogenic amines are produced by bacterial decarboxylation of corresponding amino acids in foods. Concentration of biogenic amines in fermented food products is affected by several factors in the manufacturing process, including hygienic of raw materials, microbial composition, fermentation condition, and the duration of fermentation. Intake of low amount of biogenic amines normally does not have harmful effect on human health. However, when their amount in food is too high and detoxification ability is inhibited or disturbed, biogenic amines could cause problem. To control concentration of BAs in food, decarboxylase activity for amino acids can be regulated. Levels of BAs can be reduced by several methods such as packaging, additives, hydrostatic pressure, irradiation, pasteurization, smoking, starter culture, oxidizing formed biogenic amine, and temperature. The objective of this review paper was to collect, summarize, and discuss necessary information or useful data based on previous studies in terms of BAs in various foods.
