        Response surface methodology was used to investigate the effect of sugar concentration (50-70&#xB0; Brix), solution temperature (30&#x2013;60&#xB0;C), solution to fruit ratio (4:1&#x2013;8:1) and immersion time (60&#x2013;180 min) on the water loss, solute gain, rehydration ratio, vitamin-C loss, colour change and sensory overall acceptability of Indian gooseberry (aonla) slices. The optimum process parameters obtained by computer generated response surfaces, canonical analysis and contour plot interpretation were: sugar concentration, 59&#xB0; Brix solution temperature 51&#xB0;C, solution to fruit ratio 4:1 and immersion time of 60 min.
