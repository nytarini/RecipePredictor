Commonly used methods for oral administration of xenobiotics can, by acting as a stressor or altering normal nutrition intake, alter these physiological systems as well. Taken together, oral administration methods may unintentionally introduce confounding physiological effects that can mask or enhance toxicity of xenobiotics, particularly if they share biological targets. Consequently, it should be preferable to develop alternative methods without these potential confounds. The aim of this study was to determine the suitability of mealworms as an alternative treat-based method to deliver xenobiotics via the orogastric route. Accurate oral administration is contingent on motivation and preference; mice reliably preferred mealworms over wafer cookie treats. Further, ingestion of wafer cookies significantly increased mouse blood glucose levels, whereas unaltered mealworms produced no such change. Mealworms functioned effectively to orally administer glucose, as glucose-spiked mealworms produced a rise in blood glucose equivalent to the ingestion of the wafer cookie. Mealworms did not interfere with the physiological function of orally administered d-amphetamine, as both mealworm and oral gavage administered d-amphetamine showed similar alterations in locomotor behavior (mice did not fully consume d-amphetamine-dosed cookies and thus could not be compared). Collectively, the findings indicate that mealworms are a preferred and readily consumed treat, which importantly mimics environmental-relevant nutritional intake, and mealworms per se do not alter glucose metabolic pathways. Additionally, mealworms accurately delivered xenobiotics into blood circulation and did not interfere with the physiological function of administered xenobiotics. Thus mealworm-based oral administration may be a preferable and accurate route of xenobiotic administration that eliminates physiological alterations associated with other methods of delivery.


   Introduction
Implementation of independent variables in experimental studies can sometimes generate unintended confounding factors that at a systems-level may change physiological outcomes. Although physiological complications associated with traditional oral administration methods such as gavage have long been recognized, the power of these methods to mask or enhance the influence of xenobiotic agents for in vivo studies has recently become a prominent issue [29]. Of course, all methods have limitations. For example, oral administration of a chemical in drinking water or food can create variation in dose exposure associated with normal fluctuations and individual differences in daily intake. Also, measuring individual intake for pair-housed animals is difficult. The effects of the drug itself may alter consumption of food or water, therein changing dose paradigms [2]. Although food and water dosing is often appropriate, to avoid this variation, acute oral administrations of xenobiotics commonly occurs using oral gavage or dosed-treats.

Orogastric gavage is an extremely common method used to achieve precise dose administration, which is accomplished by the insertion of a gavage needle/syringe directly into an animal’s stomach to administer a xenobiotic solution. Oral gavage is known to induce stress [2,29,30]. By increasing allostatic load beyond the physiological capacity of the stress response, either by intense acute or prolonged exposure, immune, digestive, reproductive and nervous system disease risk increases [22]. Exposure to environmental stressors has been shown to alter behavioral, endocrine, neuroanatomical, and neurochemical endpoints, particularly when exposure occurs during development [5,13]. In fact, recent research even suggests physiological changes associated with induced stress can be trans-generationally inherited [5,14]. As a result of the multiple physiological consequences of stress activation, stress can enhance or mask the effects of xenobiotics if they share common substrates [10]. This is particularly notable in developmental toxicology [7,13,27]. As an example, the interactions between stress and metals toxicity is well-studied; stress can enhance and/or remove effects of metal exposure. Prenatal stress and lead, can work synergistically on common physiological targets (i.e., the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis) enhancing mesocorticolimbic neurotransmitter and behavioral neurotoxicity [12]. Given the potency of stress and potentially shared physiological substrates with experimental manipulations, it has been suggested that oral gavage be avoided in toxicological and regulatory studies focused on endocrine-mediated endpoints [29].

A common non-invasive alternative to oral gavage is spiked treat administration, i.e., the incorporation of a xenobiotic into treats, often high in sugar content, such as wafer cookies, honey, milk shakes, or pellets [15,20,30]. For example, it is common to use a wafer cookie for oral administration to mice and rats [6,19,21,26,31]. Calculated based on nutrition information provided by commercially available Nilla wafers (Nilla Wafer, Nabisco Brands, Inc., East Hanover, NJ), if given a large cookie size (1/8th of a wafer) is given to mice, simple sugar consumption may be increased 200% per administration in a pregnant dam normally consuming 5 g/day of standard rodent chow (Purina 5001). By adding large boluses of sugar to the diet, nutritional status may be substantially altered. Many toxicants have been shown to disrupt steroid and peptide hormone homeostasis, e.g. glucocorticoids and insulin, altering metabolic pathways [1,11] and altering maternal nutrition with high sugar and fat diets can purportedly alter early brain development, particularly along reward, mesocorticolimbic dopaminergic, systems inducing life-long behavioral and health deficits [3,16,18]. Such spikes in blood glucose and altered neurodevelopment are potentially problematic for studies of toxicants that share these targets.

Taken together, the development of alternative methods of oral xenobiotic administration that preclude these types of confounders is of clear importance. To that end, we have adapted a non-invasive oral substance administration method utilizing an ecologically-relevant treat that does not alter glucose metabolism, is highly preferred, and readily consumed by rodents. Mice and other rodents are omnivores that derive a large component of their dietary protein from arthropods. In fact, studies of wild rodents have shown protein is the limiting factor for reproduction, with insects making up most of the rodent diet during the spring [8,24,28]. Based on this ecological relevance, we have modified a previously validated method used to administer hormones to other vertebrate species [9]. Mealworms (Tenebrio molitor) can be administered non-invasively and have significant ecologically-relevant nutrient value. Consequently, we predicted laboratory mice would prefer mealworms over a sugar-containing cookie. Additionally, we hypothesized mealworm consumption would not produce acute spikes in blood sugar after consumption, whereas sugar-based cookies alone and mealworms injected with an equivalent glucose solution would show similar increases in blood glucose concentrations. By spiking mealworms with glucose we can determine if mealworms accurately administered a substance into blood circulation via oral administrations. Furthermore, to determine whether mealworms can accurately administer a drug without altering its effects, we compared effects of a prototypical locomotor-altering agent, d-amphetamine [23,32] administered via mealworms, oral gavage, and on wafer cookies prior to the assessment of locomotor activity.

Methods
Animals
Adult C57BL/6 mice (Jackson Laboratory, Bar Harbor, ME) were used in all testing. All mice were pair-housed in standard cages by sex under a 12hr light-dark cycle maintained at 22 ± 2 °C with food and water ad libitum. All experimental activities were approved by the University of Rochester Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee.

Mealworm Injection
Mealworms (Tenebrio molitor) were injected using a 1 ml syringe with a 27-gauge needle with 40 ul of a glucose solution prepared in 100°C deionized water of 2.75g of glucose/ml, for glucose testing. Mealworms used for d-amphetamine testing were dosed with 8mg/kg based on mouse body weight of d-amphetamine. The resulting d-amphetamine and saline solution concentration was 2.4 mg/ml and mice were given either 100ul or 120ul of d-amphetamine administered using the mealworm depending on each animal’s weight 25–30g or 30–35g. Prior to injection of substances into mealworms, they were cooled by placement in a 4°C environment for at least 60 minutes to reduce movement during injection. The needle was inserted between two segments of the posterior abdomen (Figure 1a). The mealworm was then placed on a paper-towel to determine if fluids leaked and if so, the mealworm was not used in testing. Immediately following injection, mealworms were placed in a −20°C environment to be frozen and stored before feeding. Mealworms can be flash frozen in a −80°C freezer and in that case they freeze solid in seconds and then transfer to a −20°C freezer. Freezing in a −20°C freezer also occurs quickly and the cold reduces metabolic activity. Mice readily consume frozen mealworms (Figure 1b).

Food Preference Test
Six female and 5 male adult mice were each provided concurrently with a mealworm (The Bug Co., Ham Lake, MN) and a cookie treat (Nilla Wafer, Nabisco Brands, Inc., East Hanover, NJ). Naïve mice were first individually familiarized with both the mealworm and cookie in a standard home cage before testing. It is best to give mice live mealworms for the first exposure/familiarization, however from then mice will eat live or frozen mealworm. Mice were typically fed ab libitum, however all food was removed from the cage approximately 15 hours before preference testing occurred. The preference test was carried out in the home cage. The first treat approached was defined as the first treat sniffed, touched and/or eaten by the mouse. The first treat consumed was the first treat entirely eaten, even if the mouse moved between treats during the test. Trials were conducted for 10 minutes and live scored. Mice were given frozen mealworms and ¼ of a vanilla wafer cookie. Only two mice consumed both the cookie and the mealworm during the trial. Mice that did not finish either treat within the time interval were excluded from the analysis (n = 1 male). Each subject was given one trial.

Glucose Test
Fifteen naïve adult female mice (5 per treatment group) were used to assess the glucose response following treat consumption. We followed standard operating procedures for preforming glucose homeostasis tests in mice [4]. Glucose was analyzed using a FreeStyle blood glucose monitor (Abbott Diabetes Care, Alameda, CA). Animals were food restricted overnight before testing to obtain baseline glucose levels at 10 am from whole blood collected by submandibular puncture using 5.5mm lancets. The following day at the same time, mice were given either a quarter of a cookie, three non-manipulated mealworms, or three mealworms injected with total glucose solution containing approximately 0.3 grams of sugar, equivalent to a quarter of a cookie (Nilla wafer, Nabisco Brands, Inc., East Hanover, NJ). Animals were given 15 minutes to completely consume each treat. Twenty minutes after consumption, whole blood samples were collected via puncture of the submandibular area and glucose levels were measured [4]. Baseline differences in glucose between treatment groups were determined, as well as the change from baseline in glucose concentrations after consumption.

D-amphetamine-Induced Locomotor Activity
Twenty naïve adult male mice (5 per treatment group) were dosed with d-amphetamine either via a mealworm, wafer cookie, gavage or left untreated. Animals were food restricted overnight and given 15 minutes to finish each treat. They were then placed in photobeam chambers and locomotor activity was assessed for 90 minutes. Chambers (27.3 cm × 27.3 cm × 20.3 cm) were equipped with 48-channel infrared photobeams (Med Associates Inc., St. Albans, Vermont). Photobeam breaks were recorded every 5 minutes for 90 minutes to assess horizontal and ambulatory movements. Ambulatory count was defined as total number of beam breaks while in ambulatory movement. Horizontal or stereotypic counts were defined as non-ambulatory movement, or movement occurred while the animal remained within the 2×2 defined photobeam box. Vertical count was defined as the number of times the animal broke any photobeam in the z-axis, with the z-axis measured by photobeams mounted 7 cm above the floor of the locomotor box.

Statistical Analysis
Preference test results were analyzed using a two-factor nominal logistic regression for first consumption (yes or no) or first approach (yes or no) with sex and treat as between group factors. Baseline glucose concentrations and changes in glucose concentrations were analyzed by a repeated measures ANOVA with treatment group (cookie, mealworm+glucose and mealworm alone) as a between groups factor. Repeated measures ANOVA was also used to analyze d-amphetamine-induced changes in locomotor behavior with treatment group (gavage, mealworm and control) included as a between groups factor. Statistical analyses were conducted using JMP Pro 11.0 (SAS Institute Inc., Cary, N.C.).

Results
Preference Test
There were no significant differences in for either sex on first approach frequencies to the cookie or the mealworm treat (nominal logistic regression: Χ2 = 3.45, df = 3, p = 0.33); six mice approached the cookie first, while four mice approached the mealworm first. Despite equivalent approach rates, all mice consumed the mealworm first, indicating significant preference for the mealworm (Figure 2a. nominal logistic regression: Χ2 = 27.73, df = 3, p &lt; 0.001). There was no significant influence of sex on which treat was consumed first (nominal logistic regression: Χ2 &lt; 0.01, p = 1.0). Taken together, C57/BL6 mice preferred mealworms, as mealworms were consumed first compared to sugar-based cookies for both sexes.

Glucose Test
There was a significant time by treatment interaction for blood glucose levels measured before consumption and following the consumption of untreated mealworms, cookie and mealworms injected with glucose (Figure 2b. repeated measures ANOVA: F(2,12) = 5.54, n = 15, p = 0.02). Specifically, cookie and mealworm+glucose fed mice showed significant increases in blood glucose concentrations compared to unaltered mealworm fed mice (contrast test: mealworm/cookie: F(1, 12) = 10.1, p &lt; 0.01; mealworm/mealworm+glucose: F(1, 12) = 5.0, p &lt; 0.05). Mice fed mealworms injected with glucose and cookie showed no significant difference in the increase in glucose concentrations 20 minutes after consumption (contrast test: F(1, 12) = 1.1, p = 0.32). The cookie fed mice showed approximately 39% increase in blood glucose, while the mealworm+glucose fed mice showed approximately a 31% increase.

Locomotor Behavior
The dose of d-amphetamine was low enough that no significant main or interaction effects in stereotypic or horizontal counts were observed between treatment groups (Figure 3a and b: repeated measure ANOVA on horizontal counts group: F(2, 12) = 1.51, p = 0.26; group*time: F(34, 204) = 1.24, p = 0.18). However, there were significant differences for ambulatory and vertical behavior. Ambulatory counts showed significant changes between groups over time (Figure 3c and d: repeated measures ANOVA group*time: F(34, 204) = 5.05, p &lt; 0.0001). D-amphetamine delivered via mealworms or oral gavage in mice significantly increased ambulatory distance for mice dosed with d-amphetamine via gavage and mice dosed by ingesting a mealworm injected with d-amphetamine, however, mealworm-dosed mice began increasing ambulatory counts approximately 60 minutes into the session, whereas increases in oral gavage exposed males showed a more immediate increase. This suggests that the digestive and absorptive time for the mealworm is approximately 45 to 60 minutes. There were significant main effects in vertical counts with decreases seen in mice dosed with both d-amphetamine via gavage and mealworm compared to untreated mice (Figure 3e and f: repeated measures ANOVA: F(2, 12) = 30.98, p &lt; 0.001; contrast mealworm to untreated: F(1, 12) = 41.24, p &lt; 0.001; contrast gavage to untreated: F(1, 12) = 51.2, p &lt; 0.001) However, there were no significant difference seen between gavage and mealworm dosed groups (F(1, 12) = 0.53, p = 0.48). D-amphetamine laced cookies were not completely consumed by mice and therefore data from this group were not analyzed.

Discussion
Utilizing oral gavage or high-sugar based treat administration to deliver xenobiotics may be unintentionally, yet consistently, modifying physiological effects of xenobiotics by altering stress and nutritional functioning. Interpretation of scientific results may be difficult when gavage or sugar-based treat administration alters physiological or metabolic pathways shared with the administered toxicant (i.e. the HPA axis). As orogastric ingestion is a common route of xenobiotic exposure in humans, oral administration during in vivo studies is an important and widely used method needed for direct translation to human exposures, particularly for studies intended for federal regulation. Recently, the influence of stress induced via oral gavage has been explicitly highlighted as problematic for such regulatory research in the assessment of endocrine disrupting chemicals [29]. Given the known role of early stress or high fat-sugar diets to alter fetal development, these research areas may also be particularly influenced by these complicating methodological factors. Moreover, there is evidence that oral gavage-induced stress may impair the identification of xenobiotic-specific effects [10,25].

In response, researchers have developed multiple treat-based administration methods as alternatives to gavage. However, commonly used sugar-based treats raise another potential physiological confound, the metabolic alterations of increased blood sugar and altered nutritional diets. Consequently, we have adapted and developed a technique using an ecologically-relevant treat which mimics the nutritional inputs wild mice experience. Non-invasively, without any animal handling, mice willingly consume mealworms and favor them to a sugar-based treat alternative. Mice consumed mealworms before sugar-based wafer cookies. In fact, even non-food restricted mice were observed consuming multiple mealworms without delay. This preference and quick consumption allows for quicker verification of dosing. It is notable that no sex differences were observed, as all mice consumed the mealworm first. This preference for mealworms cannot be understated, as the success of treat-based administration relies on the animal’s willingness and motivation to consume the treat. Mealworm consumption alone did not alter glucose metabolism by elevating blood glucose levels. An accurate glucose dose was effectively and accurately administered via mealworms. Mice which consumed either a glucose-spiked mealworm or sugar-containing cookie showed a similar physiological response with increased blood glucose levels of approximately 30–40% over baseline levels, indicating that the glucose dose was delivered and absorbed fully. These results cannot be attributed to baseline differences in blood glucose levels.

D-amphetamine was administered at a dose known to increase locomotor behavior in mice [23,32]. Similar effects on locomotion were observed with d-amphetamine administered via injected mealworm and oral gavage. However, there was also a significant temporal difference in the pattern of the amphetamine-induced increase in locomotor activity in gavage versus mealworm-dosed animals. Specifically, mealworm dosed mice displayed increases in ambulatory counts approximately 60 minutes following consumption, while gavage dosed mice showed a more immediate increase. This difference suggests the approximate digestive and absorptive time of the mealworm is 45 minutes to an hour. Vertical counts were equivalent for mealworm and gavage dosed mice, as both groups showed significantly decreased vertical counts compared to untreated mice. D-amphetamine induced changes in locomotor activity administered via cookie could not be analyzed as the mice did not consume the d-amphetamine dosed cookie, suggesting it may not have been palatable, and could be more readily disguised in the mealworm.

The limitations of this protocol include the limited volume a mealworm will hold before leaking which inhibits the administration of large volumes of liquid. However, mealworms come in various sizes and more than one mealworm can be administered, as mice will eat multiple mealworms before satiation. Another potential limitation is mealworms may create their own nutritional complication, including increased protein intake; manipulations influenced by protein metabolism should consider this physiological confound. However, as mealworms are an ecologically relevant food, such dietary influences could be considered typical nutritional influences. Finally, any metabolism of the chemicals within the mealworm before consumption can be minimized by freezing mealworms after injection and our observations revealed mice will eat frozen or semi-frozen mealworms. Additionally, freezing mealworms allows for early preparation and minimizes leakage during consumption. Other oral methods are available that eliminate stress and nutritional complicating factors, including training mice to lick solutions off a syringe or pill preparation. However the preference and ecological relevance of mealworms for rodents creates a situation where mice prefer them over normal food/treats and they do not need to be trained to eat them, both of which allows for quick dosing [2,17,30]. Mealworms can also be used for enrichment, given their high value and preference.

Collectively these findings suggest that mealworms are a suitable and ecologically-relevant method of oral substance administration for rodent studies that has significant benefits over current techniques that potentially induce stress and/or nutritional alterations. This method is non-invasive, does not alter glucose metabolic pathways, has natural nutritional relevance and did not interfere with drug administration. Importantly, both male and female mice prefer and readily consume mealworms. This preference allows for quick, accurate, and non-invasive administration of xenobiotics. Mealworms did not interfere with the absorption of chemicals, like glucose, into blood circulation nor with physiological effects of drugs such as d-amphetamine. Taken together, mealworms are a suitable alternative treat-based delivery method for the administration of xenobiotics via the orogastric route. This non-invasive alternative is particularly important for xenobiotics sharing physiological targets, such as stress, which may be stimulated by using current administration methods.

Mice orally dosed with d-amphetamine either with mealworms or gavage showed significantly altered locomotor activity over time (Mealworm: N = 5, Oral Gavage: N = 5, Control: N = 5). Horizontal counts showed no significant changes (a (top left) and b (top right)). However, there were significant increases in ambulatory counts (c (middle left) and d (middle right)). Due to the delay in digestive time between gavage and the mealworm, the increase in ambulatory counts were observed approximately 60 minutes apart (c and d). Decreases in vertical time were seen for both mealworm and gavage dosed mice compared to untreated mice (e (bottom left) and f (bottom right)). Data for dosed group plotted on separately for clarity.
