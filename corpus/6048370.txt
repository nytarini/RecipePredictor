 such as phenolics, ascorbic acid and
carotenoids that have direct influence over the radical-scavenging potential as well
as antimicrobial properties. The mode of action of most of these phyto-bioactive
ingredients in alleviating the oxidative stress has been ascribed to their
radical-scavenging activity. Public awareness, nutritional requirements as well as
health consciousness has escalated the demand of alternative, newer, economical,
nutritional and multifunctional natural dietary antioxidant and antimicrobial mainly
sourced from various fruits, herbs and their agro-industry byproducts. Huge
quantities of fruits are wasted annually due to lack of proper preservation, storage
and processing. Thus by adopting suitable novel harvesting technology, these could
be efficiently used leading to profitable returns to the industry and controlling
environmental hazards.
      Sapota, a popular tropical fruit remain underutilized as huge quantity of the fruit
is wasted globally due to early ripening, softening and chilling injuries during
cold storage. The processing of sapota remains a challenge due to change in colour,
flavour and high cost involve in peeling skin and removal of seeds. Sapota is an
excellent source of sugars (12&#x2013;18%), dietary fibre (2.6%), ascorbic acid (6.0
mg/100 g), phenolic compounds (15.35 mg GAE/100 g) and minerals such as calcium (28
mg/100 g), iron (2.0 mg/100 g), phosphorous (27 mg/100 g), copper (0.086 mg/100 g)
and potassium (193 mg/100 g) (Ugalat et al., 2012). Sapota is widely used as laxative and regularization of
bowl movements due to high fibre content, presence of simple sugars and bioactive
compounds (Siddiqui et al., 2014). Sapota
fruit has been reported to have highest antioxidant activity among tropical fruits,
mainly due to presence of free radical scavenging compounds such as ascorbic acid,
carotenoids and polyphenolic compounds such as D-quercitol, quercitin, myricitrin,
gallic acid, epigenin etc. The antioxidant potential of edible part of sapota fruits
have been reported to very high (404.75 &#xB5;m Trolox equivalent /100 g)
(Moo-Huchin et al., 2014; Ribeiro da Silva et
al., 2014).
      Meat and meat products are inherently low in antioxidant compounds and are prone for
lipid peroxidation and microbial spoilage due to unsaturated fatty acids coupled
with high moisture and nutrients (Chatli et al., 2015; Kumar et al., 2015a,b). The lipid
peroxidation deteriorates the nutritive value and compromises organoleptic
properties due to production of off-odours, changes in colour and appearances.
Packaging has a very crucial role in extending storage life of meat products by
inhibiting microbial growth; avoid contamination, maintenance and stability of
desired colour, minimization of water loss and marketing. There is an ever
increasing preference of natural antioxidants and antimicrobial compounds over
synthetic compounds in food products due to health concerns. Thus, sapota could be a
suitable alternative to synthetic antioxidants and antimicrobial compounds in
various food products. Better utilization of sapota powder (SP) in food processing
would also ensure in profitable returns to farmers and overall integrated
development of agro-meat industry.
      Thus, present study was envisaged to assess antioxidant and antimicrobial efficacy of
SP in pork patties under aerobic and MAP at refrigeration temperature as indicated
by various physico-chemical, lipid peroxidation and microbiological
characteristics.

      Materials and Methods

        Preparation of sapota powder (SP) and pork patties
        Sapota fruits were procured from local market of Ludhiana, India and washed with
potable water to remove any adhering extraneous material. Drying of sapota was
done as per Ganjyal et al. (2003) with suitable modifications. After removal of
seeds with the help of sharp blade, these were sliced into thin cuts of circular
shape (5 mm thick) and heated in microwave oven at low frequency (914 Hz) for 12
minutes. It was further dried in hot-air oven till the moisture reached below
12%. The dried sapota chunks were ground in a grinder (Inalsa) to make fine
powder.
        Lean pork was obtained by scientifically slaughter of castrated Large White
Yorkshire pigs (Age- 8 months, weighing 75&#x2013;90 kg) in the departmental
slaughter house by following standard protocol. The carcass was immediately
chilled under refrigeration followed by manual deboning and was subsequently
stored in a deep freezer at &#x2013;18&#xB1;2&#xB0;C in low density
polyethylene (LDPE) packages till use. The frozen deboned meat was thawed, cut
into small chunks of uniform size and minced twice through meat mincer (MADO
Eskimo Mew 714, Spain). Four groups of pork emulsions (control (C) and
treatments viz. T1, T2, and T3 with varying
combinations of SP/lean meat as 2.0/70.5, 4/68.5, and 6/66.5%, respectively)
were prepared. The other ingredients incorporated during preparation of pork
emulsion were animal fat (lard) (5%), ice flakes (10%), whole egg liquid (2.5%),
salt (1.7%), sodium tetra-polyphosphate (STPP) (0.3%), condiment mix (Onion,
garlic and ginger, 3:1:1) (3.0%), spice mix (2.0%), refined wheat flour (3.0%)
and sodium nitrite (0.012%).
        Minced pork with salts was chopped in a bowl chopper (Model:TC11, Scharfen,
Germany) for 1 min followed by addition of ice flakes and again chopping for 1.5
min. Ground pork fat was slowly added and further chopping was done for
2&#x2013;2.5 min. The remaining ingredients were added and chopping was
continued for 1 min. The emulsion was filled in moulds (80&#xD7;20 mm) and
cooked in pre-heated hot air oven at 180&#xB1;2&#xB0;C for 20 min with
regular turning after 10 min for uniform cooking and better colour. Cooked
product were tempered at room temperature and evaluated for various quality
parameters and optimum level of sapota powder incorporation was selected.
        The selected as well as control patties were packaged in 140 gauge LDPE bags and
Polyester/Polyethylene laminated plastic pouches (100/100 &#x3BC;m) for lipid
peroxidation and microbial quality analysis under aerobic and MAP (70%
CO2, 30% N2) (Ramon Packaging Machine: VP-580 A Model,
type 19/S/CL, Germany), respectively. The samples were stored at refrigeration
temperature (4&#xB1;1&#xB0;C) and drawn at weekly interval till 42 days for
analysis of physico-chemical, lipid peroxidation, microbial count and sensory
attributes.

        Physico-chemical parameters
        The pH was recorded by using digital pH meter (SAB 5000, LABINDIA, Mumbai), water
activity (aw) was measured with potable digital water activity meter
(Rotronix HYGRO Palm AW1 Set, Rotronix Instrument (UK) Ltd., UK) and emulsion
stability was evaluated as per Townsend et al. (1968).
        The moisture (Oven drying), fat (Soxhlet method) and protein (Kjeldahl
distillation) and ash (muffle furnace) of pork patties were determined as per
Association of Official Analytical Chemists (AOAC, 2000). Total calories content were calculated by using
Atwater values for protein (4.02 kcal/g), carbohydrate (4 kcal/g) and fat (9
kcal/g).
        Cooking yield was determined by taking into account the difference in the product
weight before and after cooking-
        Cooking yield (%)=[Weight of uncooked pork patties/Weight of cooked pork
patties]&#xD7;100
        Various dimensional parameters such as decrease in diameter and increase in
height of developed products were measured by using vernier caliper at three
different places and average value was taken-

        Texture profile analysis of pork patties were measured by using a Texture
Analyzer (TMS-PRO, Food Technology Corporation, Maries Road, Suite 120 Sterling,
USA) as per Bourne (1978).

        Determination of antioxidant parameters
        Various lipid oxidation parameters such as thiobarbituric acid reactive
substances (TBARS) (Witte et al., 1970),
free fatty acids (FFA) and peroxide value (PV) (Koniecko, 1979) were determined to assess the antioxidant efficacy of
SP in pork patties. The ability to scavenge
2,2&#x2032;-diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl (DPPH) radical by added antioxidants in
samples was estimated following the method of Kato et al.
(1998). The polyphenol content was quantified by Folin-Ciocalteau&#x2019;s
reagent assay and expressed as Gallic acid equivalents (mg/g) (Yuan et al.,
2005). The spectrophotometric
analysis of 2,2&#x2019;-azino-bis-3-ethylbenzothiazoline-6-sulphonic acid
cationic ion (ABTS) radical scavenging activity was determined according to
method of Shirwaikar et al. (2006).

        Microbiological quality
        Microbiological quality viz. standard plate count, coliforms count, psychrophilic
count and yeast and mold count of pork patties were determined as per method
given by APHA (1984). Sample preparation
and serial dilution were performed under aseptic conditions, near flame in
pre-sterilized horizontal laminar flow apparatus (Model Rescholar, M. No.
RH-58-C3, Ambala Cantt, India).

        Sensory evaluation
        A panel of twelve experienced members (6 male and 6 female) evaluated pork
patties samples for appearance and colour, texture, flavour, juiciness and
overall acceptability on 8-point descriptive scale (Keeton, 1983), where 8=extremely liked and
1=extremely unliked. Samples were warmed (40&#x2013;45&#xB0;C) using a
microwave oven (LG Electronics India Pvt. Ltd., Mumbai) for 1.5 min before
serving to panelist in sensory laboratory of the Department. The samples were
blind-coded by using 2-digit numbers and presented to the panelists in random
order on white colour glass plates. Aiming to check reliability of the results,
control sample was introduced in evaluations two times, randomized among other
samples. The panelists rated samples for appearance and colour, flavour,
juiciness, tenderness and overall acceptability.

        Statistical analysis
        Data obtained during various experiments were analyzed on SPSS-20.0 software
packages, IBM Corporation, USA (Snedecor and Cochran, 1989). Duplicate samples were drawn for each parameter and
whole set of experiment was replicated six times (n=6). Means between periods of
storage were compared by two-way analysis of variance (ANOVA). The statistical
significance was estimated at 5% level (p&lt;0.05) and
evaluated with Duncan&#x2019;s Multiple Range Test.

      Results and Discussion

        Antioxidant potential of Sapota powder used in the study
        Antioxidant potential of SP was measured by carotene content, ascorbic acid,
total phenolics, 2,2-diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl (DPPH) and
2,2-azino-bis-3-ethylbenzthiazoline-6-sulphonic acid (ABTS). ABTS+
radical scavengering capacity (% inhibition), DPPH (% inhibition) and total
phenolics (GAE mg/g) contents of SP were found to be 91.26&#xB1;0.24,
12.05&#xB1;0.24 and 3.49&#xB1;0.17, respectively. The pH and aw
value of SP was recorded 5.53&#xB1;0.52 and 0.40&#xB1;0.01, respectively.
The SP had appreciable amount of carbohydrates (28.45&#xB1;0.43), protein
(8.06&#xB1;0.52), fat (3.17&#xB1;0.06) and minerals (0.80&#xB1;0.01).
Siddiqui et al. (2014) and Woo et al.
(2013) also reported similar
findings.

        Physico-chemical attributes and proximate composition
        Various physico-chemical parameters as well as proximate composition of pork
patties incorporated with various levels of SP as well as control are presented
in Table 1. The pH of both raw emulsion
and cooked pork patties decreased significantly (p&lt;0.05)
with the increasing levels of SP. This could be attributed to lower pH (5.53) of
SP. The increased pH of product than raw emulsion might be due to higher degree
of protein denaturation and production of imidazolium during cooking. An
increase (p&lt;0.05) in emulsion stability in treated
patties were recorded with highest value for T3. The higher emulsion
stability in turn resulted in higher cooking yield and lower cooking losses. The
cooking yield was significantly (p&lt;0.05) higher for
patties incorporated with 6% SP (T3) than other treated products as
well as control. This might be due to formation of stable emulsion with improved
water holding capacity and water binding properties of dietary fibre present in
SP (2.60 g/100 g). The increase in emulsion stability and cooking yield upon
incorporation of various plant powders enriched in fibres have been reported
such as finger millet flour in chevon patties (Kumar et al., 2015a), emu meat nuggets (Chatli et al.,
2015) and sweet potato powder in pork
patties (Verma et al., 2015a), carrot and
broccoli powder in meat cutlets (Singh et al., 2015a; Singh et al., 2015b).
Water activity (aw) of SP incorporated patties was recorded lower
than control and followed an increasing (p&lt;0.05) trend
with the increase in level of SP. It might be due to the water binding
properties of SP, leading to higher moisture retention in the cooked
product.

        Proximate composition of cooked patties observed a significant
(p&lt;0.05) decrease in protein, fat and ash content in
treatments than control, whereas a corresponding increase in carbohydrate
content was noticed. The moisture content of emulsion followed a decreasing
trend with the increasing levels of SP incorporation, whereas for cooked
products, moisture content of control and treatments were comparable. This might
be due to replacement of pork with SP, containing less moisture. The protein
content of control patties was significantly higher
(p&lt;0.05) than treatments whereas estimated carbohydrate
content showed an increasing trends with increasing SP levels. Moisture protein
ratio (M:P ratio) was significantly higher (p&lt;0.05) in
treated products than control and noted increasing trends with the increase in
the level of SP. The trends were well correlated to higher cooking yield and
moisture retention in the treated products. The ash content of treatment
products decreased significantly (p&lt;0.05) with the
increasing SP levels. The dimensional parameters viz. increase in height (%) and
decrease in diameter (%) were better retained in the treated patties than
control patties. The better retained dimensional parameters in treated products
could be due to higher moisture retention, cooking yield and emulsion stability
of these products attributed to inherent stabilizing and binding properties of
SP containing high fibre content. Similar findings were also reported by Bhat et
al. (2015) in chicken nuggets incorporated
with Aloe vera gel.

        Instrumental colour profile and texture profile analysis
        SP incorporation had significantly (p&lt;0.05) affected
instrumental colour attributes of pork patties (Table 2). Lightness (L*) increased, while redness (a*) and
yellowness (b*) values decreased significantly (p&lt;0.05)
upon increasing level of SP incorporation. This might be due to non-enzymatic
browning reaction (Maillard reaction) between sugars of SP and meat proteins
during cooking. A lower pH in treated products facilitates conversion of
metmyoglobin to heamochromogen upon cooking (Thomas et al.,
2016). Yellowness (b* values)
decreased significantly (p&lt;0.05) in treatments as
compared to control, and lowest value was recorded for T3 whereas
values for T1 and T2 were comparable.

        All textural attributes of SP added pork patties was significantly
(p&lt;0.05) lower than control and a decreasing trends
was observed with the increasing level of SP in treated products (Table 2). This might be due to lower pH of
emulsion and formation of good quality gel matrix due to lower muscle protein
denaturation, as well as better moisture and fat retention and water binding
properties of treated products due to incorporation of SP (Thomas et al., 2016).

        Sensory attributes
        All the sensory attributes viz. appearance and colour, flavour, juiciness,
tenderness and overall acceptability improved upto 4% SP (T2)
incorporation afterward scores for all sensory parameters decreased at 6% level
(T3) (Table 2). The
appearance score was recorded highest for control, which was comparable to
T1 and T2, which in turn was significantly higher
(p&lt;0.05) than T3. The flavour score of
T2 were recorded highest and it was comparable to T1
and control. This could be due to generation of volatile compounds and
controlled release of these compounds. The juiciness scores were recorded
highest for T2 amongst the treated products and control. This could
be due to the moisture retention and water binding properties of SP as depicted
in Table 1. By incorporation of SP,
tenderness was found to be improved (p&lt;0.05) in
T2 and T3. These results indicated that incorporation
of SP enhanced tenderness of patties was also in accordance with decreased in
hardness values. The pork patties incorporated with 4% SP (T2) was
rated highest for overall acceptability by the sensory panelists. The starch
present in SP had positive effect on the sensory quality such as flavour,
juiciness, tenderness and overall acceptability of various meat products such as
pork patties (Verma et al., 2015a)
etc.
        Thus based on the sensory attributes, pork patties with 4% incorporation of SP
(T2) was found optimum and selected for further storage studies
with control under aerobic (CA, TA) and MAP
(CM, TM) at refrigeration temperature
(4&#xB1;1&#xB0;C) for 42 days.

        Storage studies
        During refrigerated storage, physico-chemical, fat peroxidation, microbiological
and sensory attributes were assessed at regular interval of 7 days till
42nd day of storage. The main criteria for spoilage of samples
were flavour emanating at the time of opening of packets for analysis. Any
abnormal development in colour and sliminess were also given due
consideration.

        Physico-chemical changes

          pH
          The pH was comparable between treatments in both aerobic and MAP packaging
conditions on 1st day and it showed increasing trends upon
advancement of storage period (Table
3). The pH of treated patties was lower than control and the same
trends continued throughout the storage period under aerobic as well as
modified atmosphere packaging. The increase in pH of pork patties upon
subsequent storage could be due to increase in microbial load leading to
protein degradation of pork patties and accumulation of metabolites (Kyrana
et al., 1997; Lawrie, 1998). The critical analysis of pH
revealed that variation in the pH of MAP packaged patties (CM and
TM) was at slower rate due to buffering capacity of carbonic
acid produced due to influx of CO2 gas as well as lower microbial
load in the package.

          Thiobarbituric acid reactive substances (TBARS) value
          Patties with 4% SP had lower TBARS values on the day of processing compared
to the control (Fig. 1) and increased
upon subsequent storage. The rate of increase of TBARS value under MAP was
lower as compared to aerobic packaging. This could be attributed to the
increased rate of lipid oxidation with increasing levels of microbial
population with elapse of storage time, as a positive correlation between
microbial load and TBARS number has been reported (Raja et al., 2014). Throughout storage, TBARS value
of CA was recorded highest and TMAP was recorded
lowest among all samples. This could be attributed to presence of
antioxidant compounds in SP exerting antioxidant activity.

          Free fatty acids (FFA) and peroxide value (PV) values
          Free fatty acid values of pork patties recorded increasing trends with
advancement of storage period and FFA value of control sample
(CA) was recorded highest than other samples (Fig. 3). Under aerobic storage, FFA value
increased with the advancement of storage period from day 1, whereas for
MAP, FFA values were remain comparable for 7th day and afterward,
recorded significantly (p&lt;0.05) increased value upto
42th day of storage. FFA value was recorded lower for MAP
patties than aerobic packaged patties throughout the storage period. The PV
was noted significantly lower (p&lt;0.05) in treated
pork patties under MAP storage than control under aerobic storage throughout
the storage period (Fig. 2). It might
be due to inhibition of lipid peroxidation, attributed to polyphenolic
compounds in SP acting as antioxidants by terminating free radical
chain-type reactions. Further PV was recorded lower for the MAP products
than aerobically packaged (AP) products due to the absence of the
O2 in MAP, regarded as chelating agent for lipid oxidation
(Ahn et al., 2004) as well lower
microbial count due to antimicrobial activity of CO2.

          Microbial changes
          Addition of SP at 4% level has resulted in significantly lower
(p&lt;0.05) microbial count in treated patties
(Table 3). SPC increased
significantly (p&lt;0.05) in all samples throughout
storage period with elapse of time, but incorporation of SP significantly
(p&lt;0.05) decreased the SPC in treated samples.
This might be due to the direct inhibitory action of lower pH on microbial
growth by causing initial cell injury and presence of polyphenolic compounds
in SP possessing anti-microbial properties by prolonging lag phase. Leong
and Shui (2002) also reported sapota
as one of the fruit rich in polyphenolic compounds. Ma et al. (2003) noted methyl chlorogenate,
dihydromyricetin, quercitrin, myricitrin, (+)-catechin,
(&#x2013;)-epicatechin, (+)-gallocatechin, and gallic acidas major
polyphenolic compounds isolated from sapota fruit exerting antimicrobial and
antifungal effects. Sliminess was noticeable in AP control samples on day 35
while in MAP control group on day 42. The spoilage of meat products is
noticed when bacterial counts are recorded 108
cells/cm2 or more (Jay, 1996), however, in our study, spoilage of pork nuggets was
noticed at bacterial counts below 7 Log CFU/g. The lower microbial count in
MAP products might be due to the addition of 70% CO2 gas in the
package, which act on lag phase of bacterial growth cycle and produces
carbonic acid, inhibiting bacterial growth of package. Coliforms, an
indicator of post-processing contamination, were detected during storage
studies on 14th day in control samples, 21st day in
TA and 28th day in TM. MAP samples
reported lower coliforms count than aerobically packaged samples on same
day. Narender et al. (2017) also
reported significant antimicrobial and antifungal effect of sapota peel oon
some common food spoilage and food borne microorganisms including E.
coli, Staphylococcus aureus,
Lactobacillus, Proteus vulgaris and
Saccharomyces cerevisiae.
          Psychrophills were detected on the day of processing in control samples
whereas on day 14 in treated samples and thereafter, recorded increasing
trends in all samples. The initial absence of psychrophilic count during
storage could be due to lower metabolic rate of these microbes at low pH,
retarding log phase. It was lower (p&lt;0.05) in SP
incorporated patties than control in both, aerobic as well as MAP
conditions. On the last day of storage, lowest count was noted in
TM and highest in CA. Staphylococcus
aureus were detected on 14th day in CA,
21st day in TA, 28th day in
CM and 35th day in TM. The yeast and
mold count were detected on 14th day of storage irrespective of
treatments and packaging conditions and remain comparable upto 21 day and
thereafter, significantly lower counts were recorded for treated samples as
compared to control samples. This could be due to lower moisture content,
lower pH as well as presence of polyphenolic compounds such as flavonoids,
sterols and prenylflavones in SP exerting antifungal properties (Verma et
al., 2015).

          Sensory evaluation
          The sensory evaluation was not conducted for CA on 28th
day onward and CM on 35th day onwards (Table 3). The appearance scores were
recorded higher for treated samples than control and followed decreasing
trends with advancement of storage period. This might be due to better
colour development due to controlled non enzymatic reactions in SP
incorporated treatments. Bhat et al. (2015) also noted decreased colour and appearance score of
chicken meat nuggets during storage and attributed it to the pigment and
lipid oxidation, resulting in non-enzymatic browning. The MAP treated
products were recorded highest flavour scores due to retardation of
oxidation of lipids leading to development of off-flavour. These results are
in correlation with higher microbial load and lipid oxidative parameters
(TBARS, PV and FFA). The gradual decrease in flavour score could be
attributed to increasing lipid oxidation due to microbial growth, production
of FFA and oxidative rancidity. Juiciness and tenderness scores was higher
for control than treated patties and followed decreasing trend with the
increase in the storage period irrespective of packaging conditions. The
rate of decrease was higher in AP samples than MAP samples due to prevention
of moisture loss from double layered laminated films. This reduction in
juiciness and tenderness scores might be due to increasing protein
denaturation leading to change in disulphide bonds due to higher microbial
load and lower moisture and fat retention properties at low pH due to
incorporation of SP.
          Gradual decrease in overall acceptability scores of pork patties with elapse
of storage days could be due to reduction in the value of other sensory
attributes. Overall acceptability of the pork patties followed the same
pattern observed for that of flavour and a significant decrease
(p&lt;0.05) in overall acceptance of all samples
were observed towards the end of storage period. However, the sensory
attributes of pork patties incorporated 4% SP was found in the close to
moderately acceptable category (5.95 in AP and 5.91 in MAP packets). Thus
treated samples extended storage life upto 35 and 42 days under AP and MAP,
respectively due to better antioxidant and antimicrobial properties
attributed due to SP incorporation.

      Conclusions
      SP is a rich source of bioactive compounds exerting antioxidant and antimicrobial
effects. It can be effectively utilized in the development of pork patties with
enhanced oxidative stability and microbial quality. The developed patties were
recorded safe during refrigeration (4&#xB1;1&#xB0;C) storage for 35 days in
aerobic and 42 days in modified atmosphere packaging conditions based on sensory
attributes and microbiological quality.
