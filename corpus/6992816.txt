        An analytical method for furan in semi-solid and paste-type food products that have been widely used consumed in Korea was presented using headspace solid-phase microextraction by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry. Total 131 food samples were analyzed and categorized into 11 groups. The validation parameters such as linearity, limit of detection (LOD), limit of quantitation (LOQ), precision (RSD) and accuracy were verified. The linearity with regression coefficients was obtained from 0.9962 to 0.9996 and the values of LOD and LOQ were 0.18&#xA0;ng/g and 0.54&#xA0;ng/g, respectively. The recoveries were obtained from 88.03 to 105.06%. The analysis of furan in such matrix was qualified and quantified by using the developed validation method. Dry cereals, pickled cucumbers, and oyster sauces contained high furan contents with average values 8.60, 6.45, and 4.40&#xA0;ng/g, respectively.
