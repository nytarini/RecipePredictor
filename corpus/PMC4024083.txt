Fruit and vegetable intake (F&amp;V) is influenced by behavioral and environmental factors, but these have rarely been assessed simultaneously. We aimed to quantify the relative influence of supermarket availability, perceptions of the food environment, and shopping behavior on F&amp;V intake.

Design
A cross-sectional study.

Setting
Eight-counties in South Carolina, USA, with verified locations of all supermarkets.

Subjects
A telephone survey of 831 household food shoppers ascertained F&amp;V intake with a 17-item screener, primary food store location, shopping frequency, perceptions of healthy food availability, and calculated GIS-based supermarket availability. Path analysis was conducted. We report standardized beta coefficients on paths significant at the 0.05 level.

Results
Frequency of grocery shopping at primary food store (β=0.11) was the only factor exerting an independent, statistically significant direct effect on F&amp;V intake. Supermarket availability was significantly associated with distance to food store (β=-0.24) and shopping frequency (β=0.10). Increased supermarket availability was significantly and positively related to perceived healthy food availability in the neighborhood (β=0.18) and ease of shopping access (β=0.09). Collectively considering all model paths linked to perceived availability of healthy foods, this measure was the only other factor to have a significant total effect on F&amp;V intake.

Conclusions
While the majority of literature to date has suggested an independent and important role of supermarket availability for F&amp;V intake, our study found only indirect effects of supermarket availability and suggests that food shopping frequency and perceptions of healthy food availability are two integral components of a network of influences on F&amp;V intake.

Fruit and vegetable intakefood environment
   Introduction
Obesity continues to be a key public health challenge.1,2 Despite repeated changes to the Dietary Guidelines for Americans, food intake trends in the United States (US) have not been favorable and fruit and vegetable intake still falls markedly short of recommendations.3-5 Possibly due to the limited impact of individual-level interventions on dietary intake and obesity, researchers and policymakers are increasingly interested in upstream factors, such as the built environment and policies.6-13

Epidemiologic research on the built food environment has largely focused on spatial attributes such as supermarkets in a neighborhood, using objective data and geographic information systems (GIS) methodology.14 Several studies suggest that poorer supermarket availability is associated with less healthful diets.6,15 A key assumption has been that spatial access is a determinant of dietary behavior, i.e. the neighborhood food environment is being utilized.16-22 Whether this is actually the case is relatively unknown. Qualitative research suggests that the choice of a primary food store is not only influenced by proximity but by financial considerations, availability and quality of specific foods and store characteristics.23 An economic model of food shopping behavior posits that a household will aim to meet its consumption needs while minimizing the travel cost related to distance and the inventory cost.24 Frequency of food shopping is a component of this model, influenced by the household’s ability to store foods and the perishable nature of some foods.24 Few studies of general populations have systematically assessed food shopping behaviors and motivations and little is known about the association with diet.22-32 What is known, however, is that perceptions of the availability of healthy foods in the neighborhood have been shown to be related to dietary intake.33-36 Perception measures may reflect variation in healthy food availability that is not captured by GIS-based measures.33,34,37-40 It is conceivable that the formation of mental maps of the food environment is a critical intermediate step between living in a built food environment, making decisions about food shopping behaviors, and dietary behaviors.16,33,34,37,41

In totality, research suggests that there is a network of individual and environmental influences that interrelate in their impact on dietary intake. However, there seems to be a lack of studies characterized by comprehensive conceptual frameworks, simultaneously addressing multiple environmental influences on fruit and vegetable intake. Most research in this field has used regression analysis, testing individual relationships of single food environment characteristics with dietary outcomes.22,25,29,34,37,42-48 The multitude of important attributes of the food environment described above suggests that statistical approaches that allow more explicit consideration of complex interrelationships may provide new and important insights. Thus, the purpose of this study was to quantify the relative influence of multiple environmental factors on intake of fruit and vegetables, including, collectively, objective (GIS-based) and subjective (perceptions-based) measures of the food environment and food shopping behaviors using path analysis. This study’s conceptual model depicted by Figure 1 was informed by social ecologic frameworks,49,50 social cognitive theory,51 and published empirical evidence. In the interest of brevity, our hypotheses about the various relationships are symbolized by arrows in the model. The plus and minus signs above the arrows indicate the directions of the hypothesized associations.

Methods
Study Area and Design
We conducted a cross-sectional study of residents of an eight-county region in South Carolina in 2010. The area was chosen because in 2009 we had validated the entire food retail environment in the eight counties.52 A total of 83 unique ZIP codes fell either entirely or partially within the study area. From these we excluded three ZIP codes with less than 300 residents, three ZIP codes serving as PO boxes and 13 ZIP codes in which less than 20% of the ZIP code’s population resided within the eight-county study area, resulting in 64 eligible ZIP codes.

A total of 968 adults were recruited for a telephone survey by the Survey Research Laboratory (SRL). To achieve good spatial coverage, we aimed to interview roughly 15 respondents per ZIP code. A simple random sample of residential phone numbers was selected from each eligible ZIP code, yielding a total of 2,477 residential listed landline telephone numbers. After mailing introductory letters, recruitment calls were placed by trained interviewing staff between April and July 2010. To be eligible, telephone respondents had to be a) at least 18 years, b) the primary food shopper of the household, and c) English speaking. A total of 968 households were eligible and completed the interview, while 377 phone numbers were not eligible. Applying the American Association for Public Opinion Research Response Rate Formula 4,53 we estimated a response rate of 47%, which is comparable to the 49% observed among landline households in a recent evaluation of the Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System.54 The study was reviewed and approved by the Institutional Review Board.

Characterizing the Built Food Environment with GIS
Similar to the majority of the food environment literature,6,7 we operationalized the spatial access dimension of food environment with the availability of supermarkets in the study participant’s census tract using GIS. Given our study’s interest in healthful dietary behavior, we focused on supermarkets, supercenters, warehouse clubs and large grocery stores (henceforth referred to as supermarkets). These food outlets types had been assigned previously using a name-based approach that relied on recognition of grocery store chains and local knowledge of stores.52,55 The participants’ residential addresses were linked to an existing, validated geospatial database of retail food outlets, which contained the exact locations (determined by GPS) and outlet types of 2,208 outlets in the eight counties assembled in 2009.52 Residential addresses were geocoded using ArcGIS 10.0 (ESRI Redlands, CA 2010) and assigned to Census 2000 tracts using a point-in-polygon operation within ArcGIS. The number of supermarkets within the census tract of residence was used as a measure of availability, but for the purpose of sensitivity analyses, we additionally calculated the availability in a census block group and in a 1-mile network buffer.

Perceptions of the Food Environment
In order to assess how residents rated their local neighborhood food environment, we utilized an existing questionnaire which assesses the perceived availability of healthy food in the neighborhood.33,37,39,56,57 We have previously reported satisfactory psychometric properties for this instrument (ICC 0.71, 95% CI 0.60-0.80).58 Survey participants were asked to think of their neighborhood as an area within a 20 minute walk or about a mile from their home and asked to indicate their agreement with the following statements on a five-point Likert scale (ranging from (1) “strongly agree” to (5) “strongly disagree”): “A large selection of fruits and vegetables is available in my neighborhood.” “The fresh fruits and vegetables in my neighborhood are of high quality.” “A large selection of low-fat products is available in my neighborhood.” These three questions were summed, reverse-coded, and linearly transformed so that a value of zero indicated the worst availability of healthy foods and 12 indicated the best availability. We also assessed the perceptions of general access to food shopping with a single question (four response categories “not really a problem”, “minor problem”, “somewhat serious problem”, “very serious problem”): “How much of a problem would you say that lack of access to adequate food shopping is in your neighborhood?”. This variable was reverse-coded to express ease of access with a score of 0 representing poor access (i.e., very serious problem) and a score of 3 representing easy access (i.e., not really a problem).

Food Shopping Behavior
Food shopping questions queried the name and address of the store in which respondents conducted the majority of their grocery shopping and the frequency of shopping at that store. The primary grocery store address was geocoded using ArcGIS 10.0 and matched to the aforementioned, validated database of retail food outlets.52 Distances between the primary store and residence were calculated using the shortest street network distance in miles based on the TIGER 2008 road network (U.S. Census TIGER/Line, 2008).

Fruit and Vegetable Intake
Several dietary behaviors were assessed with the 17-item Multifactor Screener applied in the 2000 National Health Interview Survey.59,60 This short instrument queries food intake in the past month and a finite number of fruit and vegetable groups (i.e. fruit juice, fruit, lettuce, vegetables, white potatoes, beans). It has been shown to provide reasonable estimates of true intakes of fruits and vegetables with correlations to intake assessed by 24 hour dietary recalls and food frequency questionnaires ranging from 0.6 to 0.7.59 We followed the recommended scoring and analyses procedures described previously for this instrument.60,61

Statistical Analyses
Our statistical analyses were restricted to respondents with complete data. Of the 968 participants, we sequentially excluded 19 without geospatial data because their residential address was not geocodable, 69 without data on fruit and vegetable intake, 30 who did not respond to one or more perceptions questions, one person missing food shopping frequency, and 18 missing distance to primary food store, leaving 831 for analysis. Because the distributions of shopping frequency and distance to primary store were skewed, these variables were winsorized at the 95th percentile.

The relationships between a) the GIS-based measure of supermarket availability, b) perceptions of the availability of healthy foods in the neighborhood and ease of shopping access, c) shopping behaviors (distance and frequency), and d) fruit and vegetable intake were examined through path analysis using PROC CALIS in SAS v9.2. As shown in Figure 1, in addition to the direct effects between each variable and fruit and vegetable intake, indirect effects were also examined. That is, we investigated if previously noted relationships between GIS-based measures of the food environment and fruit and vegetable intake25,37,42-44,62 were partially explained by shopping behaviors. Because the perceptions variables are theoretically related to one another, as are the two shopping behavior variables, the reciprocal nature of these two sets of variables was also reflected in the model by double arrows (Figure 1). We report standardized beta coefficients and p-values for paths and explained variation for endogenous variables, first for all relationships (Figure 2) and then in a simplified version, focusing only on the statistically significant associations (p-value &lt;.05) in Figure 3. Unlike regression models, a single path analysis model (similar to SEM) tests a theoretical model that is believed to be applicable to a general population. Thus, it does not control for factors that are considered confounders in regression analysis because it would result in an over-specification of the model.62

Results
Characteristics of the study sample are presented in Table 1. Our sample largely included women (80%), which is consistent with the prevailing culture of women generally being the household member responsible for grocery shopping. The proportion of minority participants (33%) was representative of South Carolina. Participants were middle-aged and older (average age 57 years), and only 44% were employed, which is likely due to the reliance on listed landline phone numbers. Almost half of our sample (42%) reported an annual household income below $40,000. For 45% the highest educational attainment was a high school degree or less. Average self-reported intake of fruits and vegetables was 4.4 servings per day. Participants reported predominantly shopping at supermarkets or large grocery stores (93%) and the average shopping frequency was 1.7 times per week (median = 1.0). Based on GIS analyses, the average distance to primary grocery store was 9.4 miles (median = 8.0). The majority of participants (55%) did not have a supermarket available in their census tract. Availability of healthy foods in the neighborhood was rated as 6.3 on a scale of 0 to 12. With respect to ease of access to food shopping, respondents generally were positive (mean 2.1 on a scale of 0 to 3). The study area contained 150 census tracts in eight counties, with an average of 37.2 square miles per tract and a tract population average of about 4,210. About 21% of the study population lived in areas considered urban core.

Figure 2 represents the results of the path analysis. Frequency of grocery shopping was the only factor that had a statistically significant direct effect on fruit and vegetable intake (β = 0.11), i.e. a higher shopping frequency was associated with higher intake of fruit and vegetables. Contrary to our hypothesis, no other direct influences on fruit and vegetable intake were observed. In totality, all variables in the path analysis explained only 3% of variation in fruit and vegetable intake.

The number of supermarkets per tract was significantly and positively associated with perceived availability of healthy foods (β = 0.18) and with perceived ease of access (β = 0.09). However, supermarket availability explained only 3% of variability in perceived healthy food availability and less than 1% of the perceived ease of access. The two perceptions measures were significantly and positively correlated with each other (β = 0.39).

Focusing on the other tested relationships, we found that the number of supermarkets per tract was inversely associated with distance to the utilized grocery store (β = -0.24), i.e. a greater amount of supermarkets in the census tract of residence was associated with a smaller distance traveled to primary food store. Furthermore, supermarket availability was positively associated with frequency of shopping (β=0.10). We also observed significant and inverse associations of both measures of perceptions with distance to the utilized primary grocery store (β = -0.15 and -0.17, respectively). There was a significant direct effect of perceived availability of healthy foods on shopping frequency (β = 0.08), but no direct effect of ease of access on shopping frequency. Frequency of shopping was also significantly and inversely correlated with distance to primary store (β = -0.20). In totality, the GIS-based and the perceptions-based measures of the food environment explained 15% of the variation in distance to primary food store but only 2% of variation in food shopping frequency. Figure 3 is a simplified representation of the full path analytic results presented in Figure 2, containing only the statistically significant paths.

Table 2 presents the results from the full path model in terms of the partitioned direct and indirect effects and the total effects of the three primary variables. Though availability of supermarkets did not have a direct effect on fruit and vegetable intake, it did have a statistically significant indirect effect (through the other variables included in the model). However, because the total effect was not significant (β = 0.058, p-value = 0.09) we concluded that overarchingly, supermarket availability was not a significant contributor to fruit and vegetable intake. Perceived availability of healthy foods did not have a significant direct effect on fruit and vegetable intake, however, it did have a statistically significant indirect effect as well as a significant total effect. These findings suggest that perceptions of healthy food availability are an important element of understanding fruit and vegetable intake. Lastly, perceived ease of shopping access did not have a statistically significant direct, indirect, or total effect on fruit and vegetable intake.

Discussion
As recently reviewed by Caspi et al.63 a substantial number of studies have reported positive associations of the availability of supermarkets in the neighborhood, as assessed by GIS methods, on intake of fruits and vegetables.37,42-44,62 In contrast to our hypothesis, our study is one of the few showing null findings,45,46,64 as we did not find evidence for a direct association between the availability of supermarkets in the neighborhood (using validated data on food retail stores) and intake of fruits and vegetables. In a series of sensitivity analyses our results were entirely robust to variations in what constituted a neighborhood (e.g. changing boundaries from census tract to block group or to street-network based buffer) or the choice of access measure (e.g. replacing the supermarket availability measure with a measure of accessibility (which weights availability by distance).65 One potential explanation for the lack of an association of supermarket availability and fruit and vegetable intake may be that our study population was very mobile (94% car ownership) and 97% did not shop at the closest supermarket. Our study did, however, find that availability of supermarkets exerted significant indirect effects through the other variables in the model, including distance to utilized store. While the absence of a total effect of supermarket availability suggests that this food environment characteristic did not contribute to explaining fruit and vegetable intake in our study sample, it is important to point out that our sample size was limited and thus our model needs replication in larger studies.

A number of studies have previously demonstrated associations between a variety of subjective measures of perceptions of the food environment and dietary intake, generally finding that the availability of healthy foods in the neighborhood as reported by the residents to be associated with more healthful dietary behaviors.34-37,47,64,66,67 Contrary to these findings and our hypotheses, no direct association of perceptions of healthy food availability or ease of access was observed with fruit and vegetable intake in our sample. One potential explanation for this discrepancy may be that the measures of perceptions used in previous studies reflected some of the information contained in food shopping behavior, which we were able to parse out into independent and relative influences. While perceived ease of access did not have a statistically significant total effect on fruit and vegetable intake in our study, perceived availability of healthy foods in the neighborhood exerted both statistically significant indirect and total effects on fruit and vegetable intake, indicating that this measure was useful in explaining fruit and vegetable intake. Furthermore, we observed significant positive associations between the GIS-based supermarket availability and the perceptions, and – importantly – strong associations of both these measures of the food environment with food shopping behaviors. This suggests that both the reality of the built environment (i.e. the physical presence of supermarkets) and the perceptions of the food shoppers (i.e. availability of healthy foods and ease of access) seem to be important influences on the choice of a grocery store and the frequency of food shopping.

To date, very few epidemiologic studies have explicitly considered spatial attributes of food shopping behaviors in relation to dietary intake or obesity.22,23,25-32 We ascertained information on the location of the primarily utilized food store and thus were able to use the distance to the primary food store as a measure of realized access. In contrast, most other studies have been limited to a measure of potential access, using distance to the nearest store without consideration of whether the store is being utilized.34,44,45,64,67-71 Consistent with our hypotheses, we found that GIS-based availability of supermarkets, perceived availability of healthy foods and shopping frequency were all inversely related to the distance to utilized store. A study of French residents reported that persons who shopped far away from home had a slightly higher body mass index (BMI) and waist circumference than those shopping more proximally.26 In contrast, a recent study of women in North Carolina receiving food assistance did not find an association between distance to utilized supermarkets and BMI.28 While not focused on BMI, our study similarly did not find a direct association of distance with fruit and vegetable intake, but an indirect association through shopping frequency.

In the present study, individuals who shopped more frequently at their primary grocery store reported a higher intake of fruits and vegetables. In fact, frequency of food shopping was the only factor directly associated with fruit and vegetable consumption in the path analytic model. This finding and the inverse association of frequency with distance to utilized store is consistent with an economic model of food shopping in which a consumer would balance the travel and time cost of distance to the utilized store against the need to obtain a specific product and – in the case of fresh produce – the limited ability to store it.24 Considering our findings both on distance to utilized store and shopping frequency, our study suggests that for a perishable good such as fresh fruit and vegetables, increasing opportunities for more frequent purchases through neighborhood markets or produce trucks may in fact motivate higher consumption.

There are a number of limitations to our study. Similar to the majority of research in this field,15 our study was cross-sectional in nature which potentially limits the validity of causal inference because of reverse causality. For instance, it is possible that individuals who consume healthier diet may also be more aware of a healthy environment. Our study relied on spatial information on food shopping for only a single food store, which was reported as the primary food store. Moreover, distance measures calculated to the store were computed assuming that the departure point was home, which fortunately was true for 83.4% of the population. With respect to the GIS-based food environment, even though we had information on the availability of other store types, we limited this analysis to supermarkets because we wished to keep our conceptual model and analyses focused on our hypotheses. Thus, we cannot exclude the possibility that other attributes of the food environment, such as the presence of fast food outlets, could have independent and direct influences of fruit and vegetable intake. The field census survey on food environment in this study was conducted in 2009, and the survey data were collected in 2010. Thus, the mismatch in years of data collection will have likely introduced a small amount of error. Lastly, this conceptual model is a first attempt and in that sense exploratory, intended to focus on and integrate the three dimensions of the food environment, each of which have been evaluated separately in the published literature to date. We clearly did not include information on psychosocial measures, such as self-efficacy or social support,50 or economic influences47 which certainly contributed to the low overall percent explained variation in fruit and vegetable intake.

In terms of strengths, our study advances previous work by utilizing validated GIS-based data on the availability of supermarkets with state-of-the-art GIS analyses, rather than relying exclusively on secondary data which have been shown to harbor substantial inaccuracies.52 Furthermore, the study area included urban areas and a large number of rural communities, which have not been studied in the past.34,62 Assessment of perceptions of the food environment was based on a validated questionnaire.39,56,58 Furthermore, our study is one of the first to assess food shopping behaviors within a structured interview, including not only the location of the primary grocery store but the frequency of shopping, both of which were incorporated in our conceptual model.25-28 Lastly, our study differs from most previous work in the field of food environment research in that we used path analysis to study the complex interrelationships of multiple environmental attributes affecting dietary intake, thereby modeling and quantifying the relative influence of each factor. Path analysis allows researchers to test theoretical models and causal relationships between a multitude of observed variables, collectively. To the best of our knowledge, only two studies using a similarly complex conceptual framework to ours have been published, albeit using (SEM).16,62

Our results are important in the context of recently implemented US policies on food access, which specifically target the improvement of spatial access to food outlets supporting healthful food choices, such as supermarkets or large grocery stores, or modifications of smaller stores to support healthier food choices.10 While our study did not observe a direct influence of purely spatial availability of supermarkets in the neighborhood on fruit and vegetable intake, the availability of supermarkets exerted an indirect effect through associations both with shopping behaviors and perceptions of the environment. Moreover, through its indirect and inverse association with shopping frequency, the distance to utilized food store contributed to fruit and vegetable intake. This suggests that ongoing efforts to increase local opportunities to purchase fresh produce at neighborhood markets or through produce trucks may in fact be promising strategies to increase fruit and vegetable intake in the general population. Our findings furthermore suggest that strategies focusing exclusively on increased supermarket availability would likely only be effective in changing fruit and vegetable intake if they lead to increased perceptions of healthy food availability among residents, a reduced distance to the utilized grocery store, or more frequent food shopping. In conclusion, our study suggests an important role of food shopping behavior, especially shopping frequency, on intake of fruits and vegetables in a conceptual model that included multiple environmental attributes measured objectively as well as subjectively.
