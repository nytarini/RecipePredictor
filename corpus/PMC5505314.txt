Estimate media technology use in Alaska Native communities to inform the feasibility of technology-based nutrition education.

Methods
A self-administered questionnaire was mailed to a random selection of ∼50% of WIC authorized representatives in remote Alaska Native communities (n=975). Media technology use, interest in media technology-based nutrition education and potential barriers were assessed. Chi-square tests were used to investigate associations between technology use, age and education.

Results
Technology use was common among respondents (n=368); usage was significantly more common among younger age groups and participants with a higher level of education. Smartphone (78.8%) and Facebook (95.8%) use was comparable to national averages, but having a computer at home (38.4%) was much less likely. Less than 50% of participants have internet access at home.

Conclusions and Implications
Findings shed light on new opportunities for WIC and other programs to deliver nutrition education to Alaska Native People in remote communities.

   Introduction
American Indians and Alaska Natives (AIAN) have the highest prevalence of diabetes and obesity compared to any other ethnic group in the United States, despite a historic rarity1,2. One explanation for this shift is increased consumption of highly processed, imported, market foods rather than nutrient-dense, traditional, subsistence foods3. Another related explanation is less familiarity with healthy market foods. In Alaska Native communities, subsistence foods are steeped in rich history, connecting the traditional lifestyle to the land and wildlife both physically and socially, and shaping the Alaska Native world-view 4. Imported market foods do not carry this same cultural significance4, which may result in a lack of knowledgeabout how to make healthy food choices. Low population density in rural and remote Alaska Native communities (less than one person per square mile) combined with lack of affordable travel between these communities make delivering in-person nutrition education to this population prohibitively expensive5. Developing and testing cost-effective public health approaches to deliver nutrition education to Alaska Native People, particularly those living in rural areas, should be prioritized due to the significant health disparities experienced by this population.

Media technology, such as the Internet and cell phones, offers new ways to communicate about health issues and to promote health and well-being. According to the Pew Research Center Internet &amp; American Life Project, 84% of American adults used the internet in 20156, and 90% of American adults owned a cell phone in 20147. There is a growing body of evidence demonstrating that web-based and computer-delivered interventions have the potential to improve knowledge and behavioral health outcomes, such as physical activity, nutrition, tobacco use, and safe sexual behavior8-11. Text messaging has also grown in popularity as an effective platform to promote health behaviors12. Compared to traditional face-to-face counseling, technology-based nutrition education could reduce health service costs and reach a greater proportion of Alaska Native People living in rural communities. Additionally, technology-based nutrition education tailored to the Alaska Native context and to an individual's readiness to change behaviors may increase the availability of acceptable materials for these communities. Evidence shows that nutrition education messages that are well tailored for the target population are more effective than non-tailored materials in promoting behavior change13. Due to limited access to nutrition professionals in rural Alaska, a culturally tailored technology-based approach may present the best opportunity to provide individualized nutrition education at a relatively low cost14.

Few technology-based nutrition education programs have been designed for Alaska Native populations, and the extent to which Alaska Native People living in rural Alaska use media technology is unknown. To guide the development of sustainable, technology-based health interventions, the objective of this study was to assess the use of media technology among participants of the Special Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program for Women, Infants, and Children (WIC) living in rural Alaska Native communities. WIC participants are an ideal population for this study because of the potential to reach a large number of participants and their families through WIC education.

Methods
Sample
Using a cross-sectional study design, 975 or 48.9% of WIC authorized representatives in the Yukon Kuskokwim River Delta (YKD) in southwestern Alaska were randomly selected using SPSS software and mailed a self-administered questionnaire. A WIC authorized representative has permission to act on behalf of a WIC participant, although he or she may not be eligible for WIC benefits. The YKD is home to approximately 25,000 Alaskan Native People, the majority of whom live in remote communities (population &lt;1000) that are only accessible by plane year round or boat in the summer5. This region is predominantly Alaska Native (81.5%), and more than one third of families fall below the national poverty level. The prevalence of overweight and obesity is high (&gt;50%), and less than 20% of the population meets daily fruit and vegetable (F&amp;V) recommendations5. This study was approved by the University of Alaska Fairbanks Institutional Review Board and the Yukon-Kuskokwim Health Corporation (YKHC) Human Studies Committee.

Measures
The questionnaire included 19 items asking about current media technology use, barriers to media technology use, interest in media technology-based nutrition education, and potential barriers to media technology-based nutrition education. Survey questions were drawn from two national surveys and one survey designed to assess technology use among WIC participants with Internet access15-17. Some study-specific questions were also added. Current practices were assessed by asking participants if they (a) own a cell phone, smart phone, computer, DVD player, tablet, or digital camera; (b) have a text messaging plan, data plan, internet access at home, or internet access in their community; and the frequency with which participants (c) instant message, email, text, use Facebook, use Twitter, watch videos, play games, post videos/photos online, or participate in video calls.

Interest in media technology-based nutrition education was assessed by asking participants if they (a) think it would be useful to get nutrition information on a phone or computer; (b) are interested in receiving nutrition information via email, text message, Facebook, online videos, DVD/CD-ROM, online FAQs, or video chat; (c) are interested in joining an online group to talk about pregnancy, breastfeeding, parenting, fruits/vegetables, healthy beverages, picky eaters, active playtime, weight loss, or exercise; and (d) are interested in communicating with other parents about nutrition topics via email, Facebook, or Twitter. A question to identify potential barriers to receiving nutrition information through media technology was also included. Demographic information such as age, race, sex, education level, and participation in the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) was also collected.

The questionnaire was reviewed by the YKHC and the State of Alaska WIC Program to ensure that content was appropriate for the target population. The questionnaire was also pilot tested with a sub-sample of the population for readability.

Procedures
The Tailored Design Method guided questionnaire distribution. This method emphasizes personalizing survey materials and making several contacts with participants, either via mail or internet, to build trust with researchers and improve response rates18. Three contacts were made to participants via mail approximately two to three days apart. The first contact consisted of a postcard saying that a questionnaire would arrive and stressing the importance of the addressee's response. A few days later, potential participants received the questionnaire and a stamped and addressed return envelope, along with $2. This was followed a few days later with a thank-you postcard and reminder to return the completed questionnaire. Participants were asked to return their completed surveys within one month.

Data Analysis
SPSS Software19 (version 19.0, IBM Corporation, Armonk NY, 2010) was used to conduct the analysis. Frequencies were calculated to determine participant demographics and response patterns. Chi-square tests were used to investigate whether internet use, access to technologies, frequency of technology use, and perceived usefulness of technology-based nutrition education differed by age group or education level.

Results
Respondent Characteristics
Of the 975 randomly selected participants, 368 (37.7%) responded. Participant demographics are reported in Table 1.

Media Technology: Use and Access
Media technology use was common. Respondents reported having access to a wide variety of media technologies such as smart phones (78.8%), tablets (44.8%), and computers (38.4%). Text messaging was the most frequently used media technology followed by Facebook (Figure 1). Of respondents who used text messaging, 83.6% had an unlimited text messaging plan. Of respondents who used data, 34.7% had an unlimited data plan. Altogether, 80.3% of respondents used the Internet, and while only 42.6% of Internet users could connect from home, 75.5% could connect from somewhere in their community. Of the 63 respondents that did not use the Internet, the most common barriers to use included no Internet access (36.4%), no computer access (28.8%), and the high cost of Internet (13.6%). Only two (3%) respondents that did not use the Internet reported that they were just not interested.

Younger participants and participants with a higher level of education were significantly more likely to use the Internet and have access to a smart phone (Table 2). Younger participants reported using Facebook, e-mail, and text messaging with a significantly greater frequency than older participants. There were no differences in perceptions of usefulness among age groups or education levels.

Interest in Media Technology-Based Nutrition Education
Altogether, 85.8% of respondents thought it would be somewhat or very useful to get nutrition information on a phone or computer. The most popular ways to receive nutrition information were through e-mail (67.8%), online videos (60.4%), Facebook (58.0%), and text message (54.4%) (Table 3). Potential barriers to receiving nutrition information via media technologies included slow Internet (50.1%), no computer access (41.7%), and the high cost of Internet (34.9%).

Discussion
This study explored the potential of using media technology to deliver nutrition information to Alaska Native People in remote communities, a population with a recognized need for nutrition education. Overall, technology use was common among Alaska Native WIC participants in the YKD, indicating that technology is indeed a feasible way to deliver nutrition education. In particular, levels of smartphone use were comparable to that of the general U.S. population (78.8% compared with 68.0% nationally)20. However, participants with smartphones were less than half as likely as the general U.S. population to have internet access at home (41% compared with 90% nationally)21. In addition, only 38.4% of respondents reported having a computer compared with 73.0% nationally20.

The finding that younger and more educated respondents were more likely to use the internet than older and less educated respondents is consistent with national internet use patterns6. That almost twice as many 18-29 year olds had access to a computer (40.2%) or smartphone (83.2%) compared to 50+ year olds suggests that a technology-based approach may be optimal for participants under 30. Given that the WIC program serves young families (e.g. pregnant women and mothers with children age 5 or under), WIC may be ideally positioned to adopt a technology-based approach.

Alaska Native WIC participants were substantially more likely to use text messaging (93.3% compared with 73.0% nationally)22, Facebook (80.3% compared with 72.0% nationally)23, and some form of instant messaging (62.4% compared with 29.0% nationally)23 than the general U.S. population. This finding suggests that nutrition education delivered via these pathways is an ideal way to reach large numbers of Alaska Native WIC participants. Additionally, high levels of Facebook and text message use are consistent in other WIC populations17. Although respondents used texting and Facebook more frequently than e-mail, these technologies may be viewed as more recreational while e-mail may be viewed as more professional or work-related. However, almost one third of respondents (31.0%) reported using e-mail at least once a week (but less than once a day). Additionally, more educated respondents used email more frequently than less educated respondents. Hence, e-mail may still be a viable way to reach many Alaska Native WIC participants, especially those with higher education levels. As preferences will vary from person to person, nutrition information should be made available through several technology channels and designed for use on mobile devices such as smartphones or tablets, rather than on computers. A pilot study will be need to be conducted to examine the acceptability and preliminary efficacy of these various channels.

One limitation of this study is that the survey used did not undergo reliability and validity tests. Although the survey was developed by incorporating questions from two national and one other questionnaire administered in a WIC population, the reliability and validity of the survey cannot be guaranteed. Additionally, due to the anonymous nature of the survey, it was not possible to follow up with non-respondents to identify any differences from respondents. It is possible that respondents had higher literacy and higher technology use levels than non-respondents, and hence were more likely to complete the survey. Although the survey was pilot tested for readability, a certified scale was not used. However, the 368 respondents represented about 20% of Alaska Native WIC authorized representatives in the YKD.

Another limitation of this study is that the survey did not identify whether nutrition was a priority for participants. Hence, it is not possible to parse if lack of interest in technology-based education was due to lack of interest in nutrition information in general. It is possible that perceptions of usefulness of technology-mediated information were underestimated in this study. Additionally, these findings represent data from a primarily Yup'ik population and may not generalize to other Alaska Native People living in different regions of the state, or to other Native People living in different regions of the country.

Implication for Research and Practice
Although preliminary, these findings shed light on new opportunities to reach this rural and remote population. Previous studies have shown that Internet-based interventions for WIC participants can increase fruit and vegetable consumption24 and positively impact movement along stages of change for parent-child feeding behaviors25. Hence, technology and Internet-based nutrition education could prove effective among Alaska Native WIC participants. Due to the emphasis of WIC on family, technology-mediated nutrition information may positively impact not only WIC participants, but other family and household members. Additionally, diet quality among young-adult Alaska Native people tends to be lower than among older age groups due in part to a greater reliance on highly processed commercial market foods than on nutrient rich traditional Alaska Native foods3. Technology-mediated nutrition information targeted at younger populations could improve the reach of programs working to address this concern. Nutrition education programs should limit the amount of cellular data necessary for participation, given that cost was reported as a key barrier to Internet use. Additionally, technology-based nutrition education in the YKD should be tailored to reflect the unique food environment in rural Alaska, incorporating traditional Alaska Native foods such as sea mammals, salmon and other fish, large land mammals, and wild plants, as well as commercial market foods into nutrition messages4,26. Findings from this study will guide technology-based nutrition education efforts in Alaska. Future studies should develop culturally relevant nutrition messages that can be delivered via media technology, and test the feasibility of message dissemination via these newly identified technology channels. Use of media technologies in SNAP and WIC programming would support the Healthy, Hunger Free Kids Act of 2010 and the federal priority to move toward evidence-based public health approaches to promote healthy eating and an active lifestyle.
