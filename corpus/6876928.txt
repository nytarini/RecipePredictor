re formed during Maillard-induced
carbohydrate degradation. Glyoxal (GO), methylglyoxal (MGO), diacetyl
(DA), and 3-deoxyglucosone are the most extensively characterized
markers, and they are key precursors of advanced glycation end products
(AGEs).1&#x2212;3 DCs can be formed also in vivo where they can contribute
to the development of chronic diseases, oxidative and inflammatory
cascades and to the formation of endogenous AGEs.4,5 In
addition, DCs may influence normal physiological functions through
carbonylation of lipids, proteins, or DNAs.6 While for dietary AGEs a cause&#x2013;effect relationship with health
outcomes is still a hypothesis, DCs generated during glycolysis are
involved in the pathogenesis of diabetic complications including obesity,
nephropathy, and neuropathy,7,8 and their excessive
production was demonstrated in diabetes.9
      Dicarbonyl trapping has been proposed as an effective strategy
to control undesired outcomes in foods and to prevent further complications
in vivo.10 Several natural foods and their
extracts inhibit dicarbonyl-induced reactions by their antioxidant
activity and by reducing GO and MGO concentration. Effective examples
in foods include tea catechins, ginger shogaols,11 secoiridoid derivatives in olive leaf and oil,12 and hydroxycinnamic acid derivatives,13 while creatine can scavenge reactive DCs in
meat products14 and in vivo.15 A major role in scavenging in vivo formation
of DCs is played by glyoxalase, an ubiquitous enzyme connected with
glycolysis.16
      There is no consensus
on the correlation between dietary intake
of DCs and their in vivo concentrations. A correlation between endogenous
MGO and a DC-rich diet has been recently proposed; however, it cannot
be ruled out that the correlation is driven by many confounding factors
such as lipid and protein concentrations in the diet.17,18
      The hypothesis that reducing the dietary intake of DCs or
scavenging
them within the gastrointestinal tract could reduce the endogenous
DC concentration is interesting4 and can
be of particular relevance in pathological conditions. Treatment with
dietary flavonoids was effective in promoting a significant decrease
in the level of DCs in the human body.19
      Melanoidins, high-molecular weight brown polymers present
in foods,
are a bioactive source of reducing power combining reductones and
condensed phenolic compounds with antioxidant, antimicrobial, and
prebiotic capacities.20,21 Melanoidins act as a functional
dietary fiber, favoring the delivery of reducing capacity along the
gastrointestinal tract.22 As melanoidins
are formed during food processing, their structure and composition
change with the food; the principal constituents of coffee and cocoa
melanoidins are polysaccharides; in bread, melanoidins are formed
by gluten proteins and starch cross-linked by Maillard reaction products.22 In coffee, cocoa, nuts, and fruits, besides
carbohydrates and proteins, phenolic compounds can be incorporated
into melanoidin structures. Fragments of chlorogenic acids (CGAs)
have been found in coffee melanoidins,23 and cocoa melanoidins contain polyphenols such as epicatechins.24 Fogliano and Morales25 estimated that the dietary intake of melanoidins from all of the
possible sources could be close to 10.0 g per average consumer. Therefore,
their role as DC scavengers can have a physiological relevance modulating
the amount of dietary DCs inside the gut lumen and their bioavailability.
      In this study, high molecular weight melanoidins from cocoa, coffee
and bread were selected as they represent phenolic-rich (coffee and
cocoa) and nonphenolic-rich (bread) melanoidins. We aimed at comparing
the dicarbonyl trapping capacity of these different melanoidins sources
in an in vitro model system in order to elucidate possible mechanisms
behind the trapping process and to explore the possibility of using
melanoidins as a bioactive source of reducing compounds.

      Materials and Methods

        Chemicals and Melanoidin Sources
        GO aqueous solution
(GO, 40%), MGO aqueous solution (MGO, 40%), DA, quinoxaline (QX),
2-methylquinoxaline (2-MQX), 2,3-dimethylquinoxaline (2,3-MQX), pyridoxamine
(PM) dihydrochloride , diethylenetriaminepentacetic acid (DETAPAC), o-phenylenediamine (OPD), ethylenediaminetetracetic acid
(EDTA), 3-caffeoylquinic acid (3-CQA), caffeic acid (CA), ferulic
acid (FA), and Pronase E were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich (St. Louis,
MO). Hydrochloric acid (37%), sodium hydroxide, disodium hydrogen
phosphate dihydrate, sodium dihydrogen phosphate dihydrate, and acetic
acid were obtained from Merck (Darmstadt, Germany). Dried cocoa beans
(Forastero) were provided by CACEP (Villahermosa, Mexico). Dark roasted
arabica coffee beans and bread crumbs were purchased from a local
supermarket.

        Preparation of High Molecular Weight Coffee
Melanoidins (HMW-CM)
        Extraction of HMW-CM followed the procedure
described by Nunes
and Coimbra26 with some modifications.
Coffee beans were ground to an average particle size of 0.4 mm. Lipids
were removed by using dichloromethane (1:30, w/v, three times), and
100 g of coffee powder was extracted using 1200 mL of water at 80
&#xB0;C for 20 min, and then filtered through a filter paper (Whatman
595, Billerica, MA) under vacuum. The filtrate was dialyzed (MW cutoff
14 kDa, D9402, Sigma-Aldrich) at 4 &#xB0;C with 10 water renewals
(1200 mL for each cycle). After dialysis, the retentate was freeze-dried
to obtain HMW-CM.

        Preparation of High Molecular Weight Cocoa
Melanoidins (HMW-COM)
        HMW-COM was obtained from toasted cocoa
beans according to the
methods described by Summa et al.27 In
brief, 200 g of deshelled cocoa beans was roasted using a convection
oven (150 &#xB0;C, 210 min, Memmert, Schwabach, Germany) and cryogenically
ground to a fine powder by a cryogenic grinder (6875D Freezer/Mill,
SPEX SamplePrep, UK). Cocoa powder was defatted with petroleum ether
at 30 &#xB0;C for 1.5 h and centrifuged at 3000g for 15 min at 4 &#xB0;C.
The supernatant was discarded, and the process was repeated three
times. After air-drying overnight, the defatted cocoa powder (50 g)
was extracted with 500 mL of water at 80 &#xB0;C for 20 min. Then,
the aqueous solution was centrifuged at 5000g for 10 min, and the
supernatant was filtered through a filter paper (Whatman 595) to remove
the insoluble materials. The filtrate (400 mL) was dialyzed using
a dialysis membrane (MW cutoff 14 kDa) for 3 days with eight water
renewals until conductivity reached a value lower than 2 &#x3BC;S/cm
detected by a conductivity meter (WTW inoLab Cond 7110, Fisher Scientific,
Sweden). After storage at &#x2212;20 &#xB0;C, the retentate was lyophilized
to yield HMW-COM. All freeze-dried HMW-COM samples were kept at &#x2212;20
&#xB0;C.

        Preparation of High Molecular Weight Bread Melanoidins (HMW-BM)
        Before preparing HMW-BM as described by Borrelli et al.,28 bread crumbs were heated at 200 &#xB0;C for
15 min to generate enough bread melanoidins. After milling and sieving
to a particle size of 0.15 mm, 50 g of bread powder was mixed with
600 mL of 0.2 M Tris-HCl buffer (pH 8.0) containing 0.7 U/mL of Pronase
E and digested at 37 &#xB0;C for 72 h. After centrifugation (4000g,
4 &#xB0;C, 15 min), the supernatant was filtered through a Whatman
595 filter paper and dialyzed (MW cutoff 14 kDa) against 4 L of distilled
water at 4 &#xB0;C for 4 days with 10 water renewals. The collected
retentate was freeze-dried and kept at &#x2212;20 &#xB0;C until used.

        Evaluation of the Direct Dicarbonyl Trapping Capacity
        Direct
GO, MGO, and DA trapping capacities were determined using
the method described by Glomb and Tschirnich29 with some modifications. GO (0.37 mg/mL), MGO (0.46 mg/mL), DA (0.55
mg/mL), PM (1.08 mg/mL), CA (1.15 mg/mL), and 3-CQA (2.27 mg/mL) were
separately dissolved in phosphate buffer (0.1 mol/L, pH 7.4) in order
to obtain the same molarity (6.4 mmol/L). QX and 2,3-MQX (10 mmol/L)
were dissolved in 20% aqueous methanol separately. GO, MGO, or DA
(100 &#x3BC;L) was mixed with 750 &#x3BC;L of phosphate buffer and
100 &#x3BC;L of either phosphate buffer (blank), PM solution (positive
control), or melanoidin solutions (0.1&#x2013;25 mg/mL) and then incubated
at 37 &#xB0;C up to 168 h. Melanoidin solutions were prepared in the
range of 0.01&#x2013;2.5 mg/mL in model systems, while the final concentration
of PM and DCs was 0.64 mmol/L. Additionally, in order to monitor the
kinetic profile of DCs scavenged by HMW-CM and its predominant phenolic
acids, 750 &#x3BC;L of phosphate buffer, 100 &#x3BC;L of one of the
DCs, and 100 &#x3BC;L HMW-CM (20 mg/mL) or phenolic acids mentioned
above were incubated at 37 &#xB0;C for 2, 4, 24, 48, 120, and 168
h. All of the incubated samples were mixed with 200 &#x3BC;L of 0.2%
OPD solution containing DETAPAC (9.6 mM) and 50 &#x3BC;L of 2,3-MQX
(in reaction system with GO) or QX (in reaction system with MGO and
DA) as the internal standard; all solutions were vortexed for 5 s.
The mixture was kept at 37 &#xB0;C in the dark for 2 h and filtered
using a 0.22 &#x3BC;m polyvinylidene fluoride (PVDF) filter before
high-performance liquid chromatography analysis. To evaluate the physiological
relevance of dicarbonyl scavenging ability of HMW-CM and HMW-COM,
the estimated dietary intake of coffee melanoidins (1.0 g/person per
day)25 and MGO (1.9 mg/person per day)30 was reacted within an assumed digestive volume
of the 1 L mimicking upper intestinal phase. In brief, 1.0 mg/mL of
HMW-CM or HMW-COM and 0.026 mmol/L of GO, MGO, or DA were incubated
together at 37 &#xB0;C (pH 7.4) up to 2 h. Then, incubated mixtures
were derivatized using OPD as described above and subsequently subjected
to liquid chromatography&#x2013;tandem mass spectrometry (LC&#x2013;MS/MS)
analysis.

        Determination of QX Derivatives

          Liquid Chromatography UV
          Determination of three QX
derivatives was performed on a Thermo Ultimate 3000 ultrahigh-pressure
liquid chromatography system coupled with an RS 3000 diode array detector
(DAD, Thermo Fisher Bremen, Germany). A Kinetex EVO C18 column (150
mm &#xD7; 2.1 mm, 2.6 &#x3BC;m; Phenomenex, Aschaffenburg, Germany)
equipped with a security guard of the same stationary phase was used.
Separation was achieved through a gradient mixture of (A) 0.1% formic
acid in water and (B) 0.1% formic acid in methanol at a flow rate
of 0.4 mL/min, while the column was thermostated at 40 &#xB0;C. The
eluant program was as follows: 0&#x2013;2 min, 2% B; 2&#x2013;8 min,
2&#x2013;25% B; 8&#x2013;10 min, 25&#x2013;50% B; 10&#x2013;13 min,
50&#x2013;95% B; 13&#x2013;14 min, 95&#x2013;2% B; and 14&#x2013;17
min, 2% B. Chromatograms were recorded at 315 nm, and the retention
times of QX, 2-MQX, and 2,3-MQX were 9.12, 11.13, and 12.03 min, respectively.

          Liquid Chromatography&#x2013;Tandem Mass Spectrometry
          Determination
of QXs formed during the simulated upper intestinal
phase was conducted under the same chromatographic and UV conditions
described above but with a TSQ triple quadrupole mass spectrometer
as the detector (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Bremen, Germany). Positive
electrospray ionization was used for detection, and the electrospray
source parameters were set as follows: spray voltage 4.0 kV; capillary
temperature 350 &#xB0;C; dwell time 100 ms; sheath gas and aux gas
were set to 10.0 and 5.0 AU (arbitrary unit). The QX derivatives of
GO, MGO, and DA were identified by the selected reaction monitoring
mode using the following transitions (in parenthesis collision energy,
CE): GOqx: m/z 131 &#x2192;
77 (CE: 25 V); MGOqx: m/z 145 &#x2192; 77 (CE: 28 V) and DAqxm/z 159 &#x2192; 77 (CE: 32 V).

          Quantification
          The amount of unreacted GO, MGO, and
DA in different samples was calculated through the ratio of peak area
of QX, 2-MQX, 2,3-MQX, and their corresponding internal standard,
respectively. Calibration curves were in the concentration range of
2.0&#x2013;100.0 ppm for UHPLC analysis and 0.02&#x2013;5.0 ppm for
UHPLC&#x2013;MS/MS analysis, with linearity higher than 0.99 for all
the investigated compounds in both conditions. Percentage decrease
in each DC was calculated using the following equation (eq 1)1

        Release of Bound Phenolic Acids from HMW-CM

          Adsorbed Phenolic Compounds
          Noncovalently bound phenolic
compounds were released according to the method reported by Delgado-Andrade
and Morales31 with few modifications. Briefly,
45 mg of HWM-CM was incubated in 5.095 mL of NaCl solution (2 M) overnight
at 4 &#xB0;C. Then, the extracts were centrifuged (4000g, 4 &#xB0;C,
10 min), and the clear supernatant was filtered through a 0.22 &#x3BC;m
PVDF filter to give saline-treated HWM-CM.

          Acidic Hydrolysis
          Bound phenolic compounds were extracted
using acidic hydrolysis of HMW-CM as described by Oracz et al.32 with some modifications. HMW-CM (3 mL, 15 mg/mL)
in 50% aqueous methanol was mixed with 1 mL of HCl (10.2 M) and placed
in a heating block at 75 &#xB0;C for 150 min. After hydrolysis, the
solution was neutralized with 1095 &#x3BC;L of 10 M NaOH resulting
in a final volume of 5095 &#x3BC;L and centrifuged at 4000g and 4
&#xB0;C for 10 min. The clear supernatant was filtered using a 0.22
&#x3BC;m PVDF filter to give acid-hydrolyzed HMW-CM. Another 45 mg
of HMW-CM was dissolved in 5095 &#x3BC;L of water and centrifuged
(4000g, 4 &#xB0;C, 10 min), and then the supernatant was filtered
through a 0.22 &#x3BC;m PVDF filter as nontreated HMW-CM.

          Alkaline
Hydrolysis
          Covalently bound phenolic compounds
were released by alkaline hydrolysis of HMW-CM using the method described
by Coelho et al.33 with some modifications.
Briefly, 45 mg of HMW-CM was dissolved in 3 mL of 2 M NaOH solution
containing 20 mM EDTA. After incubation at 30 &#xB0;C for 90 min,
the mixture was adjusted to pH 7.0 with 950 &#x3BC;L of 6 M HCl, and
1145 &#x3BC;L of water was added to achieve a 5095 &#x3BC;L of final
volume. The solution was centrifuged (4000g, 4 &#xB0;C, 10 min), and
the resulting supernatant was filtered with a 0.22 &#x3BC;m PVDF filter
to give alkali-hydrolyzed HMW-CM.
          The obtained nontreated, saline-treated,
acid- and alkali-hydrolyzed HMW-CM were directly subjected to analysis
of predominant phenolic acids and evaluation of the dicarbonyl trapping
capacity.

        Analysis of Predominant Phenolic Acids
        Predominant
phenolic acids in saline-treated, acid- and alkali-hydrolyzed HMW-CM
were analyzed by LC&#x2013;DAD on a Kinetex EVO C18 column (150 mm
&#xD7; 2.1 mm, 2.6 &#x3BC;m, Phenomenex) equipped with a security
guard of the same stationary phase. Eluant A was 0.1% formic acid
aqueous solution, and eluant B was 0.1% formic acid in acetonitrile.
The gradient was as follows: 0&#x2013;5 min, 2% B; 5&#x2013;15 min,
2&#x2013;17% B; 15&#x2013;30 min, 17% B; 30&#x2013;50 min, 17&#x2013;50%
B; 50&#x2013;70 min, 50&#x2013;90% B; 70&#x2013;71 min, 90&#x2013;2%
B; and 71&#x2013;75, 2% B. The flow rate was 0.4 mL/min. and the column
oven was set at 35 &#xB0;C. Detection was performed at 325 nm, while
the chromatographic stream was continuously monitored from 200 to
600 nm. The identification of CA, 3-CQA, and FA was conducted through
comparison of their retention times and UV&#x2013;vis spectra with
that of pure CA, 3-CQA, and FA standards under the same chromatographic
conditions. 4-caffeoylquinic acid and 5-caffeoylquinic acid were tentatively
identified by comparison of their retention times and UV&#x2013;vis
spectra according to Fernandez-Gomez et al.34 Total CQAs were quantified by the external standard technique using
a 3-CQA calibration curve, while CA and FA were quantified by using
their respective standards.

        Analysis of the Adducts in the MGO&#x2013;CA
Model System by
LC&#x2013;MS/MS
        CA (5 mM in 100 mM phosphate buffer, pH 7.4)
was incubated alone or with MGO (5 mM in 100 mM phosphate buffer,
pH 7.4) for 72 h at 37 &#xB0;C to give the CA or CA&#x2013;MGO model
system, and then the incubated samples were subjected to UHPLC&#x2013;MS/MS
analysis. Chromatographic separation was performed using a Kinetex
EVO C18 column (150 mm &#xD7; 2.1 mm, 2.6 &#x3BC;m) at 30 &#xB0;C.
The mobile phase consisted of 0.1% formic acid in water (mobile phase
A) and 0.1% formic acid in methanol (mobile phase B) at a flow rate
of 0.4 mL/min using the following gradients: 0&#x2013;5 min, 2% B;
5&#x2013;15 min, 2&#x2013;17% B; 15&#x2013;25 min, 17&#x2013;100%
B, and 25&#x2013;30 min held at 100% B for 5 min, and then the column
was re-equilibrated with 2% B for 5 min. The ion source was operated
in the negative electrospray ionization mode with the spray voltage
at 3.0 kV. Sheath and auxiliary nitrogen gas were used at a flow rate
of 50 and 25 AU, respectively. A preliminary trial identified molecular
ions of the possible DC-hydroxycinnamic derivative adducts; the selected
ion monitoring mode was used in three different channels: m/z 179 for CA, m/z 251 for mono-MGO&#x2013;CA and m/z 323 for di-MGO&#x2013;CA. Structural information on CA
and the major MGO adducts of CA was obtained by tandem mass spectrometry
through collision-induced dissociation with 30 eV collision energy.
The mass range was measured from m/z 50 to 350, and data were acquired with Xcalibur version 4.0 (Thermo
Fisher).

        Statistical Analysis
        All experiments were performed
in triplicate unless otherwise stated. Significant differences (p &lt; 0.05) in the dicarbonyl trapping capacity of samples
were analyzed by Tukey&#x2019;s HSD test using the SPSS statistics
(v. 23.0, IBM, Armonk, NY). The error bar in all figures correspond
to the standard deviation (SD).

      Results and Discussion

        Evaluation
of the Direct Dicarbonyl Trapping Capacity of HMW-CM,
HMW-COM, and HMW-BM and Their Physiological Relevance
        HMW-CM,
HWM-COM, and HMW-BM dicarbonyl trapping capacities are reported in Figure 1. All three DCs were
effectively scavenged by both HMW-CM and HMW-COM when the concentration
of melanoidins is higher than 0.5 mg/mL. HMW-CM showed 68.0, 76.9,
and 64.8% trapping capacities for GO, MGO, and DA, respectively, at
a concentration of 1 mg/mL. Similarly, HMW-COM was more effective
in scavenging GO and MGO while less efficient in scavenging DA than
HMW-CM. Considering nonphenolic-rich melanoidins, only MGO (38.1%)
was quenched by the highest concentration of HMW-BM, revealing that
polysaccharides and protein-based melanoidins have a specific chemical
nature able to block MGO, while phenolic compounds in HMW-CM and HMW-COM
contribute to the elimination of a wider spectrum of DCs. None of
the three DCs was detected after 7 days incubation of three melanoidins
(2.5 mg/mL), indicating that melanoidins were not able to release
DCs in physiological conditions (data not shown).

          Figure 1

            GO, MGO, and DA trapping
capacities of HMW-CM, HMW-COM, and HMW-BM
with different concentrations (0.01&#x2013;2.5 mg/mL) and PM (0.108
mg/mL) at 168 h. Results are expressed as mean &#xB1; SD for n = 3. Bars with the same letter are not significantly different
according to Tukey&#x2019;s HSD test at p &gt; 0.05.

        PM was used to compare melanoidins activity to
a well-known carbonyl
scavenger. The concentration of HMW-CM and HMW-COM was higher than
that of PM (0.108 mg/mL) used in model systems; however, both were
more effective than PM in quenching DCs considering differences in
their molecular weight. PM exhibited a specific trapping capacity;
it was an efficient MGO scavenger, an intermediate DA scavenger, and
a weak GO scavenger. This result was in line with previous studies,
where MGO was found to be the most efficient &#x3B1;-DCs in reacting
with amino residues and in particular with PM because of its ability
to form stable heterocyclic compounds.35,36
        To investigate
the physiological relevance of DC trapping capacity
by coffee and cocoa melanoidins, they should be tested at a concentration
compatible with the daily intake of melanoidins which is in the range
0.5&#x2013;2.0 g for moderate and heavy consumers.25 Data summarized in Figure 2 showed that around 40% of GO and MGO were scavenged
within 2 h by HMW-CM and HMW-COM, respectively, and for DA, HMW-CM
showed a significantly higher efficacy than the other one, reaching
about 60%, which is in line with the results presented in Figure 1. A concentration
of coffee melanoidins fluctuating between 0.25 and 1 mg/mL in the
colon was assayed, assuming that the colon accumulates coffee melanoidins
over at least 24 h in a maximum volume of about 2 L.37 These values showed that melanoidins were effective in
trapping DCs not only in the intestinal phase within 2 h but also
in the colon to exert further scavenging activity in combination with
the microbial population.38 This evidence
suggested that a regular intake of HMW-CM from coffee brew could be
effective in controlling carbonyl loading in human bodies.

trapping capacity of HMW-CM (1.0 mg/mL), HMW-COM (1.0
mg/mL), and PM (0.108 mg/mL) within 2 h under simulated physiological
conditions. The concentration of DCs and melanoidins was calculated
according to the estimated daily intake. Results are expressed as
mean &#xB1; SD for n = 3. Bars with the same letter
are not significantly different according to Tukey&#x2019;s HSD test
at p &gt; 0.05.

        Time-Course Evaluation for the HMW-CM Dicarbonyl Trapping Capacity
        HMW-CM and its predominant phenolic acid, 3-CQA, and CA were subjected
to a time-course investigation in order to gain insights into the
reaction between DCs and phenolic compounds in melanoidins. As shown
in Figure 3, the GO
concentration was reduced by CA up to 11.8% within the first 4 h,
while HMW-CM diminished MGO and DA down to 11.8 and 10.2%, respectively.
HMW-CM was a better MGO scavenger (50% reduction within 18 h) than
GO and DA (50% reduction in about 40 h) upon longer incubation time.
HMW-CM at a concentration of 2 mg/mL was characterized by a similar
DC trapping capacity toward 0.115 mg/mL of CA (0.64 mmol/L), while
its activity was significantly higher than 0.227 mg/mL of 3-CQA (0.64
mmol/L). The amounts of DCs scavenged by 3-CQA increased continuously
during incubation, reaching 82.2, 87.6, and 100% for GO, MGO, and
DA, respectively, after 168 h, following the same trend of HMW-CM
and CA. MGO reduction was in line with Mes&#xED;as and co-workers,39 although in other conditions higher values have
been reported by Yoon,40 probably because
of the higher concentration of 3-CQA.

          Figure 3

(C) trapping capacity of
PM (0.108 mg/mL), HWM-CM (2 mg/mL), CA (0.115 mg/mL), and 3-CQA (0.227
mg/mL). Results are expressed as mean &#xB1; SD for n = 3.

        Moreira et al.41 pointed out that CGA
and CGA derivatives are the most abundant phenolic compounds in HMW-CM,
and the amount of phenolic compounds incorporated in HMW-CM ranged
from 76.5 to 224.0 mg/g (in equivalent weight of CA and CGA).33 According to these values, bound phenolic compounds
in melanoidins were at the same level with the concentration of CA
and 3-CQA used in the model system. Altogether, these results supported
the hypothesis that CGAs and CA extensively contributed to the overall
dicarbonyl trapping capacity of HMW-CM.

        Influence of Hydrolysis
on the Dicarbonyl Trapping Capacity
of HMW-CM
        A deeper examination of the relationship between
the bound phenolic compounds and dicarbonyl trapping capacity of HMW-CM
was achieved through a partial cleavage of the HMW-CM structure. Two
hydrolysis methods were used in order to understand the role of melanoidins
in scavenging DCs. It was found that 3-CQA, 5-caffeoylquinnic acid,
and 4-caffeoylquinnic acid were identified as the most abundantly
released phenolic compounds in saline-treated HMW-CM as shown in Figure S1B. Table 1 outlined that the content of absorbed CQAs (298.7
mg/100 g HMW-CM) was in the same order of magnitude as previous studies,33 although the relative proportion of each CQA
was characterized by slight differences probably because of isomerization
occurring during roasting and dialysis.34,42

        A significant amount of phenolic
compounds was detected upon acidic
and alkaline hydrolysis, especially CA (65.5 and 671.1 mg/100 g HMW-CM)
and FA (34.7 and 95.7 mg/100 g HMW-CM) as shown in Table 1. The amount and nature of phenolic
compounds bound in coffee melanoidins were previously investigated
by releasing ester-linked, condensed, and glycosidically linked phenolic
compounds through alkaline saponification, alkaline fusion, and acidic
hydrolysis, respectively.43,44 Our results are in
line with previous studies,33,45 where high amounts
of CA and FA were detected in coffee brew or in high-molecular weight
melanoidins after using alkaline hydrolysis, highlighting that most
of the phenolic compounds in coffee melanoidins are covalently bound
to the polysaccharide skeleton. In contrast, the content of CA and
FA released after acidic hydrolysis was lower than that of the one
reported by Moreira and co-workers,43 probably
because of the differences in the hydrolysis time.
        In Figure 4, the
total dicarbonyl scavenging activity of HMW-CM before and after saline
and hydrolytic treatments was highlighted: the total amount of reactive
carbonyls scavenged in the nontreated and saline-treated HMW-CM groups
was similar, both significantly higher than that in alkali- and acid-hydrolyzed
HMW-CM groups. The acid-hydrolyzed HMW-CM exhibited the lowest amount
of free phenolic compounds and blocked 53.7, 63.2, and 46.3% of GO,
MGO, and DA, respectively, resulting to be more effective than alkaline-saponified
HMW-CM. According to our preliminary trials, ascorbic acid was not
added as it could react with DCs, leading to an overestimation of
the result (data not shown). The loss of total dicarbonyl trapping
capacity in alkali- and acid-hydrolyzed HMW-CM, therefore, is probably
due to the oxidation of phenolic acids during hydrolysis. In addition,
DC scavenging contributed by free phenolic compounds was estimated
according to their content and concentration&#x2013;response relationship
shown in Figure S2. We observed that the
DC trapping capacity of coffee melanoidins was mainly associated to
the bound phenolic acids, especially CGAs and CA, as the amount of
free phenolic acids in nontreated HMW-CM was not sufficient to scavenge
DCs, as presented in Figure 4. It was also found that most of the dicarbonyl trapping capacity
was still related to the bound phenolic compounds after hydrolysis,
while the proportion of DCs scavenged by bound phenolic compounds
decreased with the release of free phenolic acids. Previous studies
reported that phenolic compounds in coffee melanoidins are mainly
in the condensed form, which can be released by alkaline fusion but
not hydrolysis,33 and acidic hydrolysis
is not an adequate technique to release bound coffee phenolic compounds
compared to alkaline saponification, keeping most of the melanoidins
intact,45 which is in agreement with our
results. The interplay between bound phenolic compounds and complex
macromolecular structures, as polysaccharides or polypeptides, could
act as a &#x201C;dicarbonyl sponge&#x201D; following chemical mechanisms
previously depicted for antioxidant activity in insoluble polymerized
materials.46 According to the concept of
the &#x201C;antioxidant dietary fiber&#x201D;,47 here, we demonstrated that melanoidin-bound polyphenols
are able to quench DC compounds, thus contributing to the control
of carbonyl stress.

        The ability of bound polyphenols to scavenge DCs paralleled previous
reports on antioxidant activity of roasted coffee: the higher the
degree of roasting, the more pronounced is the redox potential.48 Besides pioneering studies on antioxidant activity
of coffee melanoidins in vitro,49,50 direct confirmation
of the mechanisms can be inferred from the behavior of coffee melanoidins
in vivo. Dittrich and co-workers51 demonstrated
that a melanoidin-rich diet promoted the oxidative stability of LDL
up to 35%, suggesting that the bound undigested antioxidants can play
an active role. Coelho et al.33 reported
that the association of the condensed phenolic structure with indigestible
polysaccharides present in HMW-CM probably is one of the reasons for
the observed relationship between coffee consumption and the antioxidant
activity of feces.

        Studying the Formation of MGO Adducts of
CA under Simulated
Physiological Conditions by LC&#x2013;MS/MS.
        We hypothesized
that the CA moiety in the coffee melanoidin skeleton was mainly responsible
for the dicarbonyl trapping capacity. MGO was incubated with CA to
investigate the potential formation of carbonyl adducts. Figure 5A&#x2013;D presented
the total ion chromatograms of the model system with CA and CA&#x2013;MGO,
and the extracted ions of the new peaks formed during the incubation.
After 3 days, CA decreased by nearly 48.7%, and two new peaks were
annotated upon comparison with control without MGO. The peak belonging
to CA appeared at 13.82 min with the molecular ion m/z 179 [M&#x2013;H]&#x2212;, and the
two new peaks at 15.07 and 15.69 min had molecular ion m/z 251 [M &#x2013; H]&#x2212; (mono-MGO&#x2013;CA
adduct, mass shift +72 m/z) and m/z 323 [M &#x2013; H]&#x2212; (di-MGO&#x2013;CA adduct, mass shift +144 m/z), respectively, suggesting that these two molecular ions
were mono-MGO- and di-MGO-conjugated CA.

of CA (E), mono-MGO&#x2013;CA adduct (F), and di-MGO&#x2013;CA adduct
(G).

        Structural information of CA and
its MGO adducts was obtained through
MS/MS spectra. As shown in Figure 5E&#x2013;G, the major fragment ions of CA were m/z 135 [M &#x2013; 44 &#x2013; H]&#x2212; and m/z 134 [M &#x2013;
45 &#x2013; H]&#x2212;, which are in line with the typical
fragmentation pattern of CA.52 Fragment

&#x2013; H]&#x2212; and m/z 135 [M &#x2013; 44&#x2013;72 &#x2013; H]&#x2212; from
the mono-MGO&#x2013;CA adduct could match with the decarboxylation
of CA and subsequent loss of the MGO moiety. Major fragments at m/z 205 and m/z 190 could be obtained by cyclization followed by &#x3B1;-cleavage
in the MGO moiety as highlighted in Figure S3 panel B. In MS/MS spectra of di-MGO&#x2013;CA, fragment ions at m/z 277, m/z 251, and m/z 207 indicated the
structure of mono-MGO&#x2013;CA with the same fragmentation profile.
This result suggested that MGO could be attached to unsubstituted
carbons in the benzene ring of CA, following a similar reaction scheme
as proposed for carbonyl trapping reactions of epicatechins and olive
phenols.12,53
        We hypothesized that also in physiological
conditions, the reaction
mechanism between CA and MGO can lead to the formation of two isomers
as depicted in Figure 6. Several studies suggested that phenolic compounds undergo electrophilic
aromatic substitution reactions with GO or MGO at physiological conditions,
with the hydroxy group in the MGO moiety close to the aromatic ring.53&#x2212;55 However, Hidalgo and co-workers56 observed
that the carbonyl group was conjugated with the aromatic ring after
heating GO and resorcinol together at 100 &#xB0;C for 3 h, which implies
that isomerization may also occur under physiological conditions to
extend the conjugation. The unsubstituted carbon 2 and 6 should be
the major active site for scavenging DCs. Specifically, the trapping
reactions between phenols and DCs are hydroxyalkylation and aromatic
substitution reactions, and the hydroxyl groups in the aromatic ring
could increase the reactivity of unsubstituted carbon atoms to attack
carbonyl carbon atoms. Conversely, the replacement of hydroxyl in
C3 by methoxyl leads to the loss of MGO trapping capacity of FA and
[6]-shogaol,11 which means that the replaced
methoxyl group decreases the activity of C2 and C6 because both hydroxyl
and methoxyl are ortho&#x2013;para directing groups.

        Concerning HMW-CM as sources of hydroxycinnamic acids, especially
CGAs and CA, the presence of melanoidin-bound phenolic structures
may also enhance DC trapping efficacy of each other as a result of
additive effects. The ability of melanoidin-bound phenolics in scavenging
DCs follows recently pointed out effects of the food matrix in modulating
chemical reactivity:57 structural organization
at the molecular and macroscopic level is responsible of the reaction
routes in a specific food environment.
        In summary, the present
study revealed that polyphenol-rich melanoidins,
such as HMW-CM and HMW-COM, can scavenge DCs, thus mitigating the
negative consequences of their reaction with other macromolecules
in physiological conditions. This is the first report that presents
the tentative detection of mono- and di-MGO adducts of CA, which indicates
that CA scavenges DCs through trapping reactions. Partial hydrolysis
and the release of melanoidin-bound phenolic compounds illustrate
that phenolic compounds bound to macromolecules are still active to
scavenge DCs in vitro and confirm the possibility of using antioxidant
dietary fibers as functional ingredients to quench dicarbonyl species
along the gastrointestinal tract.
