        This work focused on how roasting changed the chemical components of chili (Capsicum annuum L.) seeds and how it affected the stability of chili seed oils during storage. The oils from chili seeds before and after roasting treatments were stored at 63&#xA0;&#xB0;C for 30&#xA0;days and then analyzed. Results showed that roasting changed the main sugars compositions and amino acid compositions (total content decreased from 15.9 to 7.4%), which confirmed that it could form brown pigments and volatile flavor compounds in pepper seeds after roasting. Compared with oil from unroasted seeds, oils from roasted seeds had greater oxidative stability and maintained greater antioxidant capacity during storage. These effects were possibly due to the synergistic of the neo-formed products by Maillard reaction, vitamin E, and other bioactive components. This investigation showed that roasting treatment could be considered as an appropriate method for extending the storage stability of chili seed oils.
