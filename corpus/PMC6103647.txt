   Over a third of patients with the major depressive disorder (MDD) fail to respond adequately to currently available antidepressant treatments including sequenced pharmacotherapy, psychotherapy, or electroconvulsive therapy (ECT) (1–3) i.e., they have treatment-resistant depression (TRD) (4). Patients with TRD have a poor quality of life, attempt suicide at high rates, and have a recurrent and/or chronic course of illness (5). Clinicians must often consider experimental, unproven, or off-label therapies to relieve the suffering and improve the quality of life of their patients with TRD. This report outlines our approach to management of TRD patients, also see Figure 1. We have restricted the discussion of experimental therapies to those which are easily available or feasible in outpatient practice. Thus, we have focused on the off-label use of medications (such as ketamine, dopaminergic agents, anti-inflammatory medications), pharmaceutical grade nutritional supplements, transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS), psychosocial interventions and exercise.

Confirming the presence of treatment-resistant depression.
Starting with the initial antidepressant trial, we recommend a measurement-based care (MBC) approach that relies on systematic assessments of symptom severity, side-effects, and adherence (6). Such an approach allows for prospective assessments of inadequate response (&lt;50% reduction in symptom severity) to antidepressant trials of adequate dose (lowest FDA approved dose) and duration (6–8 weeks). When scores of symptom rating scales such as the 9-item Patient Health Questionnaire (7) or the 16-item Quick Inventory of Depressive Symptomatology Self-Report version (8) are not available, we recommend the use of a structured tool such as the Massachusetts General Hospital-Antidepressant Treatment Response Questionnaire (MGH-ATRQ) to ascertain the TRD status (9). Presence of sub-threshold hypomanic symptom in MDD or unrecognized bipolar depression may reduce response to commonly used antidepressant medications (10, 11); hence, we recommend revising re-conducting diagnostic assessments when evaluating TRD status. Finally, recent evidence shows that selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) are minimally effective in MDD patients with evidence of systemic inflammation (12, 13). Thus, clinicians may use commercially available tests, such as high sensitivity c-reactive protein (hsCRP), to personalize the selection of antidepressant medications and prevent failed antidepressant treatment trials (14).

Ketamine
Multiple studies have now demonstrated that ketamine and its s-enantiomer (esketamine) acutely reduce depressive symptom severity at sub-anesthetic doses when administered via either intravenous or intranasal route (15–18). Ongoing phase III clinical trials in TRD patients (NCT02417064, NCT02418585, NCT02422186, NCT02493868, NCT02497287) will clarify the optimal dose, duration and sustained benefit with repeated dosing of intranasal esketamine. Driven in part by the recent attention on ketamine as a novel antidepressant, the number of providers prescribing ketamine in an off-label fashion has increased rapidly over the last five years (19). However, there are significant concerns with off-label ketamine use. Poorly monitored ketamine infusion has reportedly been associated with death (20). Additionally, while ketamine has poor oral bioavailability due to extensive first-pass metabolism (21), 1 in 5 providers in a recent survey by Wilkinson et al. reported administering ketamine by oral route in their patients with TRD (19). Intranasal administration of ketamine is also associated with variation in plasma levels of ketamine and its metabolites and was poorly tolerated by patients in a recent report (22). Thus, we recommend that off-label use of ketamine should be restricted to intravenous use and be conducted in a safe environment by trained professionals with easy access to higher-level care. Based on our experience, we have listed some pre-, during, and post-infusion considerations in Table 1 when using intravenous ketamine in an off-label fashion.

Dopaminergic agents
Dopaminergic agents have gained recent attention in the treatment of depression due to the role of inflammation on anhedonia (13, 23, 24). Pramipexole, a dopamine receptor D2 and D3 agonist, has been shown to be effective in reducing depression (25) and result in long-term improvement in patients with TRD (26, 27). As higher doses may be needed to attain therapeutic response with pramipexole, Fawcett et al. recommend starting at low dosage, slow titration and once-daily dosing at night to enhance tolerability (27). Stimulants such as methylphenidate have also been used as augmentation strategies in patients with depression with variable results (28, 29) and likely benefit mostly in TRD patients with prominent anhedonia or fatigue (30, 31). When prescribing stimulants, clinicians should consider the risk of abuse potential, comorbid substance use disorder, undiagnosed bipolar or psychotic disorder, and seizure disorder. While not a dopaminergic medication, modafinil may be considered as a treatment option for TRD patients, especially those with excessive sleepiness and fatigue (32–34). Thus, pramipexole, stimulants, and modafinil may be considered in the absence of adequate response to currently available antidepressants and in the presence of marked anhedonia, fatigue and/or hypersomnia.

Supplements
Nutritional deficiencies may contribute not only to symptoms of depression but also to reduced efficacy of antidepressant medications (35). Emerging evidence suggests a role for nutritional supplements in a sub-group of patients with TRD. Folate supplementation, either with folinic acid (15–20 mg/day) or l-methylfolate (15 mg/day), has been shown reduce symptom severity in TRD patients (36, 37). Other supplements with mixed results of efficacy include s-adenosyl methionine (SAMe), omega-3 fatty acids, vitamin D, zinc, vitamin B12, and probiotics (38–41). Clinicians may consider personalizing the selection of nutritional supplements based on markers of inflammation (hsCRP) or body mass index as these have been associated with better response to l-methylfolate (42, 43). Other supplements that can be considered in TRD patients with elevated inflammatory and metabolic biomarkers include curcumin and leucine. In a recent study, patients with MDD who had elevated levels of leptin experienced a greater reduction in their depression severity with curcumin as compared to those with lower levels of leptin (44). As leptin levels increase with obesity, curcumin supplementation may be useful in obese TRD patients. Leucine is another supplement which may be considered in TRD patients with markers of elevated inflammation (such as hsCRP) as it prevents the uptake of harmful kyneurinine metabolites across the blood-brain barrier (45). When prescribing nutritional supplements, we recommend vigilance regarding the source of where these supplements are produced and use of pharmaceutical grade supplements. Additionally, by employing the MBC approach, clinicians should monitor any side-effects or improvement with these supplements and ensure that patients are not continued on ineffective treatments for too long.

Brain stimulation
Repetitive TMS is approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for TRD but fewer than one in four patients attain remission with the current paradigm of high frequency (10Hz) stimulation over left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (46). The availability of liquid-cooled magnets and higher-powered devices has enabled the off-label use of alternate stimulation paradigms in clinical practice. In contrast to the FDA-approved rTMS stimulation paradigm which takes 20–45 minutes, theta burst stimulation (TBS) can be administered in less than 5 minutes. Additionally, a recent report suggests that intermittent TBS delivered over multiple sessions resulted in marked reduction in depressive symptom severity in TRD patients who had failed electroconvulsive therapy, multiple medication trials, and psychotherapy (47). Another promising brain stimulation paradigm is the combination of off-label ketamine with rTMS. While published literature has been sparse on this combination (48), it offers the potential to sustain the improvements with ketamine infusion.

Psychosocial interventions and exercise
Recent reports have highlighted the limitations of measuring only depressive symptom severity during the course of antidepressant treatment. In fact, persistent impairment across functional domains, such as work productivity, psychosocial function, quality of life, and non-work-related daily activity, are associated with lower likelihood of attaining remission with antidepressant medications (49–52). If systematically evaluated as part of MBC approach, clinicians may consider utilizing psychosocial interventions to reduce impairments in these functional domains. Augmentation of antidepressant treatment with exercise also improves psychosocial functioning and quality of life (53) and may be considered as a treatment strategy for TRD patients.

Anti-inflammatory medications
Depression is often comorbid with other medical conditions. Optimized treatment of these medical conditions, such as obstructive sleep apnea, may result in improved mood. In the context of comorbid inflammatory disorders such as rheumatoid arthritis and psoriasis, use of anti-inflammatory medications has been associated with improvements in depressive symptom severity (54–56). A large meta-analysis conducted recently demonstrated the antidepressant potential of monoclonal antibodies against inflammatory cytokines (57). In fact, more recent studies of monoclonal antibodies against interleukin 17 (IL-17) have shown that improvement in depression severity is partly independent of changes in skin lesions in patients with psoriasis and moderate/severe depression (54).

Summary
The last decade has seen the emergence of several promising new treatments for patients with TRD. In the face of either refractoriness, intolerability, unavailability, or unaffordability of FDA approved treatments, clinicians and patients now have several options available. When considering these options, caution must be exercised to enhance diagnostic certainty, prevent adverse events, and minimize the suffering of patients. We strongly encourage a measurement-based care approach as it will help document failure of previous treatments and ascertain the efficacy of experimental treatments.
