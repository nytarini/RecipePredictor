hat is produced at large scales and is
consumed in great quantities in Turkey. With its protected designation of origin
(PDO) status, Ezine cheese is also registered by Turkish authorities as a unique
trademark. In the northwestern region of Turkey, Ezine cheese is primarily produced
in the towns of Ezine, Ayvac&#x131;k, and Bayrami&#xE7;. In this region, Ezine
cheese is produced from a mixture of pasteurized ewe&#x2019;s milk (approximately
45%&#x2013;55%), goat milk (at least 40%) and cow milk (the
most 15%) from March to July (Anonymous,
2006). Although Ezine cheese is classified as a white-brined cheese, it
is different from classic Turkish white-brined cheeses in that its production
involves the use of a mixture of milk and does not utilize a starter culture or
CaCl2 and has long ripening periods (TS, 1995).
      It is well known that a wide variety of microbiotas cause many microbial and
biochemical changes during the ripening period of cheese (Fuquay et al., 2011; Gobbetti
et al., 2015; Montel et al., 2014;
Pappa et al., 2016). In particular,
lactic acid bacteria (LAB) play a significant role in the development of the flavor,
texture, and nutritional value of cheese by producing acids and several lipolytic,
proteolytic, and glycolytic enzymes. In addition to these crucial roles, the
antimicrobial properties of the LAB, such as the production of organic acids,
hydrogen peroxide and antimicrobial peptides (known as bacteriocins), reduce the
risk of the growth or survival of foodborne pathogens and spoilage organisms,
resulting in the improved microbiological stability and extended shelf life of
cheeses (Montel et al., 2014; Settanni et al., 2010). Similarly, non-starter
lactic acid bacteria (NSLAB), which originate from the raw milk, cheese-producing
environment, airborne flora or as a result of unsuccessful pasteurization have
substantial effects on the ripening process and the creation of the final sensorial
characteristics of cheese (Fuquay et al.,
2011; Gobetti et al., 2015; Montel et
al., 2014). NSLAB, mainly mesophilic lactobacilli, leuconostocs,
enterococci, and pediococci, allow traditional cheeses to develop their particular
characteristics, such as low pathogen risk and diversification of gustatory
characteristics. NSLAB rapidly reach high counts and act as an acidifying starter
that leads to regulate the growth of the cheese microbiota (Montel et al., 2014).
      In recent years, there has been a growing interest in isolating the naturally
occurring microbiota of cheeses, primarily from those produced without the addition
of starter cultures. Furthermore, due to the low variety of starter cultures used in
the dairy industry, cheesemakers desire the isolation of novel LAB strains used as
indigenous starters (Bozoudi et al., 2016;
Dolci et al., 2008). Traditional cheeses
produced without the addition of starter cultures, such as Ezine cheese, have a high
potential for the isolation of new strains that can be used in the dairy industry.
Moreover, as a result of these studies, the selection of strains with technological
value and that have the ability to produce bacteriocins against pathogenic or
spoiling microorganisms may have significant applications for the large-scale
production of traditional cheeses (Gonzales et al.,
2007). Although some aspects of the sensory characteristics and aroma
compounds of Ezine cheese are known (Yuceer et al.,
2009), the chemical and microbiological characteristics of Ezine cheese
have not been reported to date. Thus, the objectives of this study were i) to follow
the changes in the physicochemical composition and the microbial evolution during
the ripening period, ii) to isolate strains with antimicrobial activity that can be
used as a starter or bacteriocin producer culture to produce Ezine cheese, and iii)
to identify NSLAB strains by the phenotypic and genotypic methods. To the best of
our knowledge, this is the first detailed study that explores the chemical and
microbiological characteristics of Ezine cheese, the results of which have the
potential to guide Ezine cheese producers for the large-scale production of cheese
using starter/adjunct cultures.

      Materials and Methods

        Manufacturing of Ezine cheese and sampling
        The samples were collected from randomly chosen dairies that follow traditional
manufacturing procedures (Fig. 1) located
in Ezine, Ayvac&#x131;k, and Bayrami&#xE7;, which were indicated as PDO. The
study samples were transferred in to the tin plate containing brine and were
ripened for 12 mon at the dairies&#x2019; temperature-controlled cellars
(4&#xB0;C&#x2013;6&#xB0;C). The samples ripened in dairies E, A, and B at
the same conditions. During the ripening period, totally 144 cheese samples from
three dairy farms were transferred to the laboratory on ice, and chemical and
microbiological analyses were subsequently performed.

          Fig. 1.

            Traditional production of ezine cheese workflow.

        For the identification process, the letters E, A, and B were used to refer the
samples collected from the dairies in Ezine, Ayvac&#x131;k, and
Bayrami&#xE7;, respectively. The letters a, b, c, and d were used to denote
the cheeses produced in April, May, June, and July, respectively, and the
numbers 1 to 12 were used to represent the ripening months.

        Physicochemical analysis
        According to the International Dairy Federation (IDF) standards, the percentages
of fat (IDF, 2008), total solids (IDF, 1982), lactic acid (IDF, 2005), and NaCl (IDF, 1988) in samples were determined. Dry matter (DM)
(IDF, 1986) was determined by
weighing the samples before and after the drying process at
102&#xB1;1&#xB0;C. The pH values of the samples were measured using a pH
meter (Sartorius, Goettingen, Germany).

        Microbiological analysis

          Enumeration of microorganisms
          Ten grams of each cheese sample was transferred to 90 mL of sterile
quarter-strength Ringer&#x2019;s solution (Merck). Cheese samples were
homogenized in a stomacher (AES Chemunex, Easy mix) for 2 minutes, and
serial dilutions were prepared by mixing 1 mL of the homogenized sample with
9 mL of sterile quarter-strength Ringer&#x2019;s solution. NSLAB were
enumerated and identified by plating samples on M17 Agar (Merck) and DeMan,
Rogosa and Sharpe (MRS, Merck) Agar containing 20 &#x3BC;g
mL&#x2212;1 vancomycin (V, SigmaTM) to isolate
lactococci and leuconostocs, respectively, after aerobic incubation at
30&#xB0;C for 72 h. Rogosa Agar (Merck; anaerobic incubation at
30&#xB0;C for five days) and Kanamycin Aesculin Azid Agar (KAA) (Merck;
aerobic incubation at 37&#xB0;C for two days) were used to enumerate and
isolate lactobacilli and enterococci, respectively (Navidghasemizad et al., 2009). Total mesophilic aerobic
bacteria (TMAB) and yeast and molds (YM) were counted by plating serial
dilutions on Plate Count Agar (PCA) (Merck; aerobic incubation at
30&#xB0;C for two days) and Yeast Extract Glucose Chloramphenicol Agar
(YGEC) (Merck; aerobic incubation at 25&#xB0;C&#x2013;28&#xB0;C for five
days), respectively. For each microbial group, the experiments were repeated
in triplicate. Following the incubation, the plates with 10&#x2013;300
colonies were selected for enumeration, and the number of colonies was
expressed as Log CFU/g.

          Isolation of NSLAB with antimicrobial activity
          To isolate NSLAB with antimicrobial activity, agar spot tests were performed.
Briefly, the colonies were randomly selected from each medium and spotted
onto M17, MRS, and Brain Heart Infusion Agar (BHI, Merck) plates using
sterile toothpicks. After overnight incubation, 5 mL of soft agar
(0.7% agar-agar) containing 106 CFU/mL of the indicator
strains (Lactococcus lactis ssp. lactis
SIK83, Lactobacillus sakei NCDO 2714 and
Enterococcus faecalis ATCC 29212) was poured over
plates. The plates were incubated overnight at suitable temperatures
according to the optimum growth temperature for the indicator strains, and
the colonies subsequently were examined (Schillinger and Lucke, 1989). Colonies with clear inhibition
zones (&#x2265;1 mm) were purified using same media and then were stored in
M17, MRS and BHI broth containing 20% (v/v) glycerol at
&#x2212;20&#xB0;C. According to the diameter of inhibition zones, the
level of the antimicrobial activity of the isolates was evaluated as
+ (1&#x2013;10 mm), ++ (11&#x2013;20 mm),
+++ (&#x2265;21 mm). The working cultures were prepared
from frozen cultures by transferring cells into the appropriate broth and
incubating overnight.

        Identification of isolates

          Phenotypic identification of isolates
          Isolates from M17 and Rogosa agar plates were examined for Gram staining
characteristics, catalase reaction, CO2 production from glucose,
arginine hydrolysis, and growth in the presence of NaCl (2%,
4%, and 6.5%), at different temperatures (10&#xB0;C,
15&#xB0;C, 40&#xB0;C, and 45&#xB0;C), and at pH 9.6. Growth in the
presence of bile salt (40%), hemolytic activity (blood agar
supplemented with 5% sheep blood), and aesculin hydrolysis (Bile
Aesculin Agar, Merck) tests were also performed using isolates from KAA
plates.
          Gram-positive, catalase-negative, and homofermentative coccus-shaped isolates
from M17 Agar plates that could grow at 10&#xB0;C and 40&#xB0;C (but not
at 45&#xB0;C or in medium with a 6.5% salt content or pH 9.6) were
considered to be possible lactococci. Gram-positive, catalase-negative, and
rod-shaped isolates from Rogosa plates (can grow at 15&#xB0;C and
45&#xB0;C) were deemed to be homofermentative or heterofermentative
lactobacilli. The isolates from MRS+V Agar plates that were
Gram-positive, heterofermentative, catalase-negative, and coccus-shaped
(arginine hydrolysis negative and no growth at 45&#xB0;C) were considered
to be Leuconostoc spp. Gram-positive, catalase-negative,
&#x3B1;- or non-hemolytic and aesculin hydrolysis positive coccus-shaped
isolates from KAA plates that could grow in the medium at
10&#xB0;C&#x2013;40&#xB0;C, pH 9.6 and in bile salt were identified as
possible enterococci (Navidghasemizad et
al., 2009).
          To determine the carbohydrate utilization profiles of isolates from M17,
Rogosa, Agar and KAA API 50 CH and API 20 Strep systems (BioM&#x11B;rieux,
Inc., France) were used respectively, following the manufacturer&#x2019;s
recommendations. The results were analyzed using APILAB Plus version 1.2.1.
(BioM&#x11B;rieux, Inc., France). Strains were tested in duplicate to
determine the reproducibility of the tests. L. lactis ssp.
lactis SIK83, Lb. sakei NCDO 2714 and
E. faecalis ATCC 29212 were used as control
strains.

          Genotypic identification of isolates
          Genomic DNA was extracted from the isolates as described by Cancilla et al. (1992), and DNA
concentration and purity were evaluated spectrophotometrically using a
NanoDrop ND-2000 spectrophotometer (Thermo Fischer Scientific, Waltham, MA,
USA).
          The isolates were genetically characterized by polymerase chain reaction
(PCR) of the 16S rRNA gene using the 16S forward (5&#x2019;-CCG TCA ATT CCT
TTG AGT TT-3&#x2019;) and reverse (3&#x2019;-AGA GTT TGA TCC TGG CTC
AG-5&#x2019;) primers which are amplifies the 900 bp fragments (Beasley and Saris, 2004). DNA
amplification was carried out 50 &#x3BC;L PCR reactions containing 10
&#x3BC;L PCR master mix (Thermo Fischer Scientific), 36 &#x3BC;L
nuclease-free water, 1 &#x3BC;L of each primer (100 pmol), and 2 &#x3BC;L
(100 ng/&#x3BC;L) of genomic DNA template. Each PCR cycle consisted of an
initial denaturation step of 5 min at 94&#xB0;C followed by 30 cycles of
amplification comprising a denaturation step for 30 sec at 94&#xB0;C,
annealing at 55&#xB0;C for 60 sec, extension at 72&#xB0;C for 1 min, a
single 10 min extension at 72&#xB0;C for 10 minutes and a final hold at
4&#xB0;C. PCR products were electrophoresed in 1% agarose gels and
then stained with EtBr. An O&#x2019;GeneRuler 100 bp DNA molecular weight
ladder (Fermentas, Finland) was used as a standard. Gels were visualized
under UV light using a Kodak Gel Logic 200 Imaging System (Kodak, USA). PCR
products were purified using a PCR purification kit (Thermo Fischer
Scientific) and were sequenced by MedSanTek (Istanbul, Turkey). Basic local
alignment search tool (BLAST) was used to compare the similarity of
sequences against the nucleotide database in the National Center for
Biotechnology Information (NCBI). L. lactis ssp.
lactis SIK83, Lb. sakei NCDO 2714 and
E. faecalis ATCC 29212 were used as control
strains.

          Statistical analysis
          Plate count data were transformed into natural log-based data to perform
statistical analyses using SPSS for Windows (IBM, SPSS Inc., Chicago, IL,
USA). Significant differences were determined by ANOVA, and mean differences
were compared using Tukey&#x2019;s test at the 5% significance
level.

      Results and Discussion

        Physicochemical analysis
        The chemical characteristics of the Ezine cheese samples collected from 3 dairies
were studied during the manufacturing and ripening periods. Table 1 summarizes the mean values obtained
from the physicochemical tests. No significant mean differences in the
parameters for the samples (except DM) were detected from different dairies
(p&gt;0.05). The observed FDM, pH, and lactic acid in dry matter (LADM)
values were consistent with Turkish Cheese Standard 591, which sets the FDM
value as at least 45% (w/w), pH&#x2265;4.5 and lactic acid content in DM
maximum of 3% (TS, 1995). In
contrast, SDM values of samples were observed to be higher than that indicated
in the standards. The DM contents of the samples collected at different periods
were observed to increase significantly (p&lt;0.05) depending on the dairy.
Although the DM and FDM values increased from April to June in all samples, a
similar pattern was not detected for SDM and LADM. The highest DM and FDM values
were detected in the samples taken from B in June. These results are in line
with the findings of Oner et al. (2006).
Previous studies have shown that the DM and fat contents of cheese are affected
by the quality of milk, which is linked to the production conditions and season
(Estepar et al., 1999; Oner et al., 2006; Pappa et al., 2016). The mean pH values of cheeses from the
three dairies remained constant (p&gt;0.05) during the ripening period.
Similarly, the differences in the mean pH values of cheese from different months
were also insignificant. Previous studies on starter-free cheeses support these
findings (Estepar et al., 1999; Fresno et al., 1996).

        Changes in microbial counts during the cheese-ripening process
        The changes in the microbial groups were analyzed throughout the ripening period.
The TMAB counts ranged from 7.01 to 8.16 Log CFU/g and decreased 1-log unit
during the ripening process, and the observed YM counts (3.5 Log CFU/g) did not
change significantly depending on the dairy and season (p&gt;0.05) (data not
shown). Although the TMAB counts observed in this study are in line with the
findings of Oner et al. (2006), the YM
counts were not. A plausible reason for this difference may be the different
ripening periods that were used in these studies. The viable NSLAB counts on
different media throughout the ripening period are shown in Fig. 2. The colony counts on M17 plates ranged from 6.00 to
8.18, 6.74 to 7.93 and 7.03 to 8.57 Log CFU/g in dairies E, A, and B,
respectively. In detail, the aforementioned counts point out a downward sloping
trend in the first nine months of the ripening period, which was greater for E
than A and B (p&lt;0.05). In contrast, the colony counts on Rogosa, and
MRS+V plates were observed to be similar (ranging between 5 and 7.91 Log
CFU/g), and the change in colony counts was not significant (p&gt;0.05). The
colony counts on KAA plates ranged from 4.84 and 6.6.4 Log CFU/g, and unlike the
other NSLAB groups, increased by 1-log unit during the first nine months of
ripening and tended to remain constant afterward. As shown in previous studies,
NSLAB is the largest microbial group in all traditionally and industrially
produced cheese varieties (Delamare et al.,
2012; Domingos-Lopes et al.,
2017; Montel et al., 2014;
Terzic-Vidojevic et al., 2007).
Although the colony counts of the mentioned NSLAB groups above varied, NSLAB
remained the dominant flora during the ripening period. Despite the fact the
manufacturing environment (i.e., the floors, dairy drains, and equipment
surfaces) may be sources of NSLAB, raw milk has been shown to be the primary
source of these bacteria (Gobbetti et al.,
2015). After the pasteurization process, heat-resistant NSLAB strains
remain, recovering and proliferating during the ripening period. Moreover, the
ability of some mesophilic LAB to form biofilms is another source of NSLAB,
serving as a source of NSLAB through post-pasteurization contamination (Gobbetti et al., 2015; Montel et al., 2014).

        Phenotypic identification of isolates
        One hundred and ninety colonies that exhibited inhibition zones larger than 1 mm
against indicator strains were isolated from the various plates. The results of
the morphological and physiological characterization assays are shown in Table 2. The isolates from KAA plates grew
in the presences of 40% bile salt and on bile-aesculin agar. Also, our
results showed that 40 out of 49 isolates from KAA plates exhibited
&#x3B3;-hemolytic activity (data not shown).

        According to the phenotypic sugar fermentation profile characterizations, the
NSLAB isolates from Ezine cheese belonged to the genera
Lactobacillus (36.65%),
Enterococcus (25.65%), Lactococcus
(23.56%), and Leuconostoc (7.33%). However,
Streptococcus spp. (4.71%) and
Pediococcus spp. (1.05%) were detected at relatively
lower levels, and two isolates could not be identified (1.05%) (Data not
shown). NSLAB communities have been described to be primarily composed of
mesophilic lactobacilli, such as Lb. paracasei, Lb.
plantarum and Lb. curvatus. Nevertheless,
enterococci, lactococci, pediococci and micrococci can also be present (Delamare et al., 2012; Montel, et al. 2014; Terzic-Vidojevic et al., 2007).
        Several selective media have been used to isolate NSLAB in different studies
(Aponte et al., 2008; Estepar et al., 1999; Navidghasemizad et al., 2009). Fox (1999) reported that M17 agar is suitable for isolating
lactococci. Although only 11.86% of the strains isolated on M17 agar were
assigned to the genus Lactococcus, the remaining isolates were
identified as Enterococcus spp., Lactobacillus
spp., Streptococcus spp., Leuconostoc spp. and
Weissella spp. Most of the strains isolated on Rogosa agar
were identified as Lactobacillus spp. (80.0%). This
medium is highly selective for mesophilic lactobacilli because of the high
acetate concentration and low pH, which suppresses the growth of other LAB.
Although the addition of vancomycin to MRS makes the medium highly selective for
members of the genus Leuconostoc (Navidghasemizad et al., 2009),
Lactobacillus spp., Enterococcus spp.,
Streptococcus spp., Pediococcus spp., and
Weissella spp. were also isolated using this medium. All
strains isolated on KAA agar were assigned to the genus
Enterococcus. Due to the presence of selective inhibitory
components, such as kanamycin sulfate and sodium azide, KAA has been shown to be
highly selective for the isolation of Enterococcus spp. In
agreement with a previous study by Navidghasemizad et al. (2009), KAA was observed to be the most
selective medium for Enterococcus spp. in the present
study.

        Genotypic identification of isolates
        The genomic DNA of 190 isolates was successfully extracted and used to
genotypically identify strains based on partial sequencing of the 16S rRNA gene
region and was deposited in the NCBI GenBank database. The accession numbers and
the level of the antimicrobial activity of all species are provided in Table S1.
The isolates were identified at the species level with more than 99%
similarity and belonged to seven genera, Enterococcus
(60.0%), Lactobacillus (25.26%),
Lactococcus (6.84%), Leuconostoc
(1.57%), Streptococcus (1.57%),
Weissella (1.57%) and Pediococcus
(0.52%). In the 12.63% of all isolates were recorded the highest
antimicrobial activity (larger than 21 mm), this ratio was found higher in the
species of genus Enterococcus (Table S1). Although low pH,
temperature, and high salt concentration are stressful conditions for the growth
of microorganisms in the cheese environment, NSLAB can grow under these
selective conditions. The genetic characterization results of isolates largely
reflected that Enterococcus spp. and
Lactobacillus spp. were the primary NSLAB groups in Ezine
cheese. The 16S rRNA gene sequence analysis results indicated that
Enterococcus was the dominant genus. Among the identified
isolates, 73, 36, and 5 of them were identified as E. faecium
(64.03%), E. faecalis (31.57%), and
E.
lactis (4.38%), respectively. Forty-eight isolates were
assigned to genus Lactobacillus, with 26 isolates identified as
Lb. paracasei (54.16%) and 21 identified as
Lb. plantarum (43.75%). The isolates assigned to the
genera Lactococcus and Leuconostoc were
identified as L. lactis ssp. lactis and
Leuconostoc mesenteroides, respectively. All
Streptococcus spp. isolates were identified as S.
lutetiensis, S. infantarius, or S.
macedonicus (Table 3).

        In this study, inconsistencies between the API and 16S rRNA gene sequence results
were observed. The isolates assigned to the genus Lactococcus
by API tests were identified as Enterococcus spp. by 16S rRNA
gene sequencing. The 16S rRNA sequence results were supported by the
physiological test results of the strains isolated from M17 agar, which
exhibited growth ratios of 100%, 96.92%, and 74.24% when
cultured at 45&#xB0;C, pH 9.6 or in 6.5% NaCl, respectively (Table 2). According to the 16S rRNA gene
sequencing analysis, the most frequently isolated genus was
Enterococcus (60.0%), whereas
Lactobacillus (36.65%) was observed as the dominant
genus of the cheese microbiota according to API tests. The differences between
the API and 16S rRNA sequencing data have been described in other studies (Domingos-Lopes et al., 2017; Moraes et al., 2013; Velasco et al., 2004). As stated by Domingos-Lopes et al. (2017), the most plausible
justification for these differences might be the loss or gain of plasmids that
are essential to the fermentation of sugar, which may lead to metabolic
inconsistencies.
        LAB are well adapted to the cheese environmental conditions, such as low pH, high
NaCl, anaerobiosis, and a lack of fermentable carbohydrates. Their compositions
and abundances are primarily related to cheese production technology (raw milk
composition, dairy conditions and production period, etc.). However, it is also
related to the differences in conditions and length of the ripening period
(Montel et al., 2014). Although NSLAB
consists primarily of mesophilic facultative and obligate heterofermentative
bacteria, lactobacilli, enterococci, pediococci, Leuconostoc
spp. and other thermophilic LAB can be members of this population (Gobbetti et al., 2015). Enterococci can be
present, grow and contribute the flavors of certain foods, primarily fermented
foods, and particularly in cheeses produced in the Mediterranean area that are
made from either raw or pasteurized milk from sheep, goats or cows (Fuquay et al., 2011). It has been reported
that the count of enterococci in these traditional cheeses may range from
104 to 106 CFU/g in curd, and from 105 to
107 CFU/g in fully-ripened cheese (Giraffa, 2003).
        Enterococci are an essential member of the bacterial population of several types
of cheese from either ovine or caprine milk such as Cheddar, Feta, Water-buffalo
Mozarella, Cebreiro, Venaco, and Hispanico (Giraffa, 2003; Ogier and Serror,
2008; Psoni et al., 2006).
Goat and ewe milk is used at a high percentage in the manufacture of Ezine
cheese. It was shown that 60% of all species from Ezine cheese were
identified as strains belong to the genus Enterococcus. In
addition, enterococci have been isolated in high numbers and often represent the
predominant microorganisms in brine-ripened cheeses (Navidghasemizad et al., 2009; Fuquay et al., 2011).
        According to a report by Fuquay et al.
(2011), E. faecalis and E. faecium
are the most relevant species in dairy products among the 30 species recognized
at present, and E. faecalis typically exhibits higher
proteolytic and lipolytic activity than E. faecium or
E. durans. In another recent study, Ispirli et al. (2017) reported the presence of
Enterococcus species in Turkish white cheese. Additionally,
genotypic characterizations of these isolates via 16S rRNA gene sequencing
revealed the presence of 12 distinct strains belonging to 5 different species
(E. faecium, E. faecalis, E.
durans, E. gallinarum, and E.
italicus). In this study, 64.03% of enterococcal species
were identified as E. faecium, and it was the most commonly
isolated enterococci species from Ezine cheese. E. lactis is a
recently described novel enterococcal species isolated from Bitto cheese, a PDO
raw milk cheese produced in a restricted Italian alpine area (Morandi et al.,
2011), as well as from South African fresh sheep milk (Bauer et al., 2009) and Russian sour milk products (Botina and Sukhodolets, 2006). In our study,
five species were identified as E. lactis. Due to the
importance of the selection of new enterococcal strains other than E.
faecalis for the production of traditional cheese in Mediterranean
countries, the Ezine cheese originated isolates obtained in this study may be
used as novel and safe starter strains. Ambadoyiannis et al. (2005) reported that enterococci isolates from
cheese were able to withstand low pH and high bile concentrations while
exhibiting antagonistic activities towards other LAB strains. Selected isolates
with antimicrobial activity may have both technological and probiotic properties
and could be used as adjuncts to produce Ezine cheese. Although IDF has included
strains of enterococci in the list of LAB starters (Marino et al., 2003), the virulent nature and antibiotic
resistance of most enterococci raise many concerns for the selection of strains
as starters.
        Lactobacillus is the most abundant genus among LAB, and overall,
18 species of mesophilic lactobacilli have been variously identified (Gobbetti et al., 2015). Among them, the
facultative heterofermentative lactobacilli, Lb. paracasei and
Lb. plantarum, are dominant in most cheeses.
Lactobacillus strains are interesting for the industrial
use because of advantages that include faster acidification and resistance to
high salt concentrations in long-ripened cheeses (Elortondo et al., 1998; Navidghasemizad et al., 2009). In addition, they have high
proteolytic and lipolytic activities, which are essential factors in the
development of cheese flavor. It was reported that Lb.
paracasei is the dominant species of NSLAB both in several
semi-hard cheese varieties (Thage et al.,
2005) and in long-ripened cheeses, such as PDO Grana Padano cheese
(Levante et al., 2017). In
brine-ripened cheeses such as Feta, Teleme, Briza, Halloumi and Domiati,
Lb. paracasei ssp. paracasei is one of the
predominant lactobacilli (Fuquay et al.,
2011). It was reported that Lb. plantarum isolates
from Feta cheese, which is a brined ripened cheese similar to Ezine cheese,
exhibited lipolytic, and peptidolytic activities (Litopoulou-Tzanetaki and Tzanetakis, 2011). Similar to
other studies performed in Italy (Fortina et
al., 2003), Northern Europe (Ostlie
et al., 2004), the Balkans (Terzic-Vidojevic et al., 2007), Greece (Litopoulou-Tzanetaki and Tzanetakis, 2011) and Portugal
(Domingos-Lopes et al., 2017),
Lb. paracasei was described as the dominant
Lactobacillus flora of Ezine cheese originating from
Turkey.
        In this study, 6.84% of all strains isolated from Ezine cheese were
identified as L. lactis ssp. lactis.
Lactococci contribute to the final texture (moisture and softness) and the
flavor of dairy products via the activity of their proteolytic and amino acid
conversion pathways. Isolates of lactococci differ considerably with respect to
their acidifying, caseinolytic, aminopeptidase, and esterase/lipase activities
(Litopoulou-Tzanetaki and Tzanetakis,
2011; McSweeney, 2004).
L. lactis is naturally dominant in milk and fermented dairy
products and is commonly used as starters in the manufacture of most cheese
varieties. Rapid lactic acid production of L. lactis in milk
has been reported to assist in the formation of curd and flavor, the creation of
optimal biochemical conditions for ripening and the prevention of the growth of
pathogenic and spoilage bacteria (Fernandez et
al., 2011). In agreement with Montel
et al. (2014), the primary role of L. lactis ssp.
lactis in Ezine cheese may be the decrease in pH, which
initiates the coagulation of milk and regulates the early growth of the cheese
microbiota during the cheese making process.
        Pediococci present only a small proportion of the total LAB in cheeses and are
typically not predominant NSLAB (Fuquay et al.,
2011). The role of pediococci in cheese ripening is not yet fully
understood, although it is known that pediococci work in synergy to affect
typical cheese flavors. It is obvious that their role is not as important as
that of Lactococcus, Lactobacillus and
Enterococcus (Beresford,
2003). In agreement with other studies, in the present study,
Pediococcus pentosaceus was isolated at low levels from
Ezine cheese. P. pentosaceus isolates from Feta and Teleme
cheeses produce acid slowly and often form diacetyl and acetaldehyde and have a
proteolytic activity against peptides containing proline (Litopoulou-Tzanetaki and Tzanetakis, 2011).
Leuc.
mesenteroides was described as the only leuconostoc species
isolated from Ezine cheese. It has been suggested that leuconostoc species may
enhance the flavor of cheese and contribute to the texture and stabilization of
cheese by the production of polysaccharides (Domingos-Lopes et al., 2017). Another non-lactobacilli genus
isolated in this study was streptococci. S. macedonicus was
first isolated from various artisanal cheeses, such as Greek Kasseri cheese and
Italian cheeses, and is known to affect the characteristic flavor of cheese
(Gobbetti et al., 2015). In this
study, the low level of S. macedonicus observed was in
agreement with findings of Lombardi et al.
(2004), who sought to observe the technological characteristics of
S. macedonicus strains from raw milk cheeses.
        Fig. 3 shows a survey of the NSLAB community
in Ezine cheese from each of three dairies during different times in the
ripening period. During 12 months of ripening, the dominant flora was observed
to be Enterococcus spp. in all dairies. During the first 4
months of ripening, a relatively higher variation in the genus profiles in dairy
B was observed compared to the other dairies. The greatest number of
Lactobacilli spp. was observed in dairy A and the number of
Lactobacilli spp. increased during the ripening period.
Unlike enterococci and lactobacilli species, lactococci species were observed to
be present in the flora in the first four months of ripening, but not at later
periods of ripening. According to these results, the lactation season may affect
the NSLAB community in Ezine cheese. As reported by Litopoulou-Tzanetaki and Tzanetakis (2011), the lactation
season has a clear effect on the predominance of the certain LAB during each
season. Although the primary lactococcal species may be more frequently observed
in winter cheeses, facultatively heterofermentative lactobacilli may predominate
in spring and summer cheeses. Furthermore, the presence of lactococcal species
during the initial months of ripening has been described by Navidghasemizad et al. (2009), Fernandez et al. (2011) and Montel et al. (2014).

        The dominance of NSLAB can be attributed to their high tolerance to the hostile
environment of cheese during ripening compared to many other microbial groups
and to their ability to inhibit undesired microorganisms. This especially
results in the microbiological stability of the long-ripened cheeses (Settanni et al., 2010). Ezine cheese
appears to be more susceptible to spoilage contaminations since the TMAB and YM
counts did not change significantly during the ripening period. The detected
high antimicrobial activity in this study indicates that NSLAB may contribute
the microbiological stability of Ezine cheese during ripening. During the long
ripening periods, the protective features of non-starter flora are important,
with microbial spoilage encountered at a minimum level in traditionally produced
cheeses. In cheese, the protective nature of LAB against foodborne pathogens and
spoilage organisms confer a competitive advantage (Settanni et al., 2010). Therefore, in this study, the
isolation of LAB strains with antimicrobial activity from Ezine cheese was the
first criterion in the selection of strains with starter culture potential.

      Conclusion
      To the best of our knowledge, this study is the first report focusing on the
characterization of antagonistic NSLAB microbiota from Ezine cheese (PDO), a
traditional and widely consumed Turkish white cheese. The results of this study
highlight the large biodiversity of the spontaneous LAB microbiota, with 13
different species belonging to seven genera observed. In the present study, the
isolation and molecular characterization of NSLAB with antimicrobial activity
resulted in the formation of defined collections of natural NSLAB isolates from
Ezine cheese. The selected strains that are having technological properties as well
as have the ability to produce bacteriocin against pathogenic or spoiling
microorganisms could be used for the formulation of specific starter or adjunct
cultures for the large-scale production of Ezine cheese (PDO).
      In the future studies, the selected isolates will be screened for their ability to
grow at non-optimal temperatures; their proteolytic, lipolytic, acidifying and
autolytic activities; their antimicrobial activity against Gram-positive and
Gram-negative microorganisms; and for the production of acetoin and bacteriocin.
