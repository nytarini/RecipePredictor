   In Hélène Delisle and Malek Batal’s correspondence (June 18, p 2504),1 the authors eloquently noted the dual burdens of undernutrition and overnutrition among socioeconomically disadvantaged populations. However, one important and rapidly increasing group merits further comment. More than 2·5 million Americans abuse heroin or prescription opioids,2 leaving the USA in the midst of an opioid abuse epidemic. The adverse consequences of illicit opioid use (eg, overdose, infectious disease, premature death) are widely discussed. However, food insecurity, undernutrition, and overnutrition among substance abusers and their families are equally urgent public health issues.3,4 Furthermore, growing evidence suggests that methadone—a life-saving medication widely used and effective for treatment of opioid dependence—might produce glycaemic dysregulation and substantial weight gain.5,6

Innovative approaches are needed to promote healthy nutrition in these vulnerable patients. Methadone maintenance clinics, which offer a unique setting for tackling healthy eating in disadvantaged patients, might be a promising platform. Patients visit the clinic daily or weekly and remain in treatment for extended durations. This unusual combination of frequent and extended contact provides an ideal arrangement for promotion of healthy eating. The 1200 methadone maintenance clinics in the USA also treat 25% of all patients with substance abuse disorders and adhere to a uniform set of federal regulations, creating substantial potential for widespread dissemination.

From July to October, 2015, we established a farmstand directly in the waiting room of a community-based methadone maintenance clinic in Burlington, Vermont, wherein participants could pick up weekly deliveries of fresh, free seasonal produce when they visited the clinic for medication and counselling. During a 13-week period, 101 patients visited the farmstand. On average, 15 patients participated per week and patients reported attending the farmstand on 3·5 of the 13 weeks. When asked to rate their satisfaction from 1 (not at all) to 5 (extremely), mean ratings were 4·4 (SD 0·7). When patients were asked if they would participate if the farmstand were offered in future years, from 1 (definitely not) to 5 (definitely), ratings were 4·6 (SD 0·8). Finally, when we asked patients about who ate the produce they received, 93% of patients said themselves. 64% also said they shared the food with someone else, typically their partner, children, or parents.

Patients with opioid dependence and their children experience multiple socioeconomic, medical, and psychiatric vulnerabilities associated with food insecurity, poor nutrition, and obesity. Opioid treatment clinics might be uniquely positioned to promote healthy nutrition in this population.
