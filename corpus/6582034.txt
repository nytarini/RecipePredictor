        The study focuses on understanding the influence of nutrients on frying oil degradation as well as its role in oil uptake by the fried substrate. Raw substrates were prepared taking refined wheat flour (rich in carbohydrate), soy flour (rich in protein) and gram flour (with both in a definite proportion) which were subjected to frying in sunflower oil at 185&#x2013;200&#xA0;&#xB0;C.
Analysis of the fried oil, substrate and fried product was carried out. Increase in acid value with respect to the composition of the flour was not significant. Higher rate of oxidation and peroxide value were observed in the oil used for Gram flour snacks, which could be due to significant amounts of sodium and potassium salts. Fried oil with soy flour based snack showed higher total polar material% which could be due to accelerated oxidation. Oil absorption was promoted by starch and gluten and controlled by protein and insoluble fiber. Oil absorbed by refined-wheat flour and soy flour based snack were 30% and 9.33%. Gram flour-based snack absorbed 4.52% oil with superior oil quality comparatively.
