        Chlorantraniliprole, a new systemic insecticide of anthranilic diamide class gaining popularity among farmers for its effective control of Lepidoptera pest particularly in vegetables. Thus monitoring of chlorantraniliprole (CAP) leftover in vegetables is required and to this end eco-friendly, cost effective, selective and accurate method was developed and validated for quantification of its left over in chilli fruit using gas chromatography&#x2013;tandem mass spectrometry (GC&#x2013;MS/MS) in SCAN/MRM mode with a triple Quadrupole analyzer. Two MS&#x2013;MS transitions were acquired to ensure the reliable quantification and confirmation of the analyte. All calibration curve showed a good linear relationship (r&#x2009;&gt;&#x2009;0.99) with in test ranges (0.005&#x2013;0.5&#xA0;&#xB5;g&#xA0;ml&#x2212;1). To study its persistence, half-life, waiting period and decontamination behavior the field trial were performed at recommended dose and its double by Central Insecticide Board and Registration Committee (CIBRC). Initial deposits of CAP at recommended (T1) and double (T2) the recommended doses revealed 3.16 and 4.18&#xA0;mg&#xA0;kg&#x2212;1 with their respective half-lives 1.18 and 2.05&#xA0;days respectively. According to maximum residual limit i.e. 0.03&#xA0;mg&#xA0;kg&#x2212;1 by FSSAI, residues persists up to 7th and 15th day if sprayed at fruit setting stage. The extent of removal of CAP using simple decontamination approach showed 62&#x2013;67% reduction on maximum residue.
