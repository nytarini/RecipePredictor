We do not have a unified, scientifically tested theory of causation for obesity and its co-morbidities, nor do we have explanations for the mechanics of the metabolic/bariatric surgery procedures. Integral to proffered hypotheses are the actions of the hormones glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1), peptide YY (PYY), and leptin. The objective of this study was to obtain blood levels of GLP-1, PYY, and leptin after stimulation of the terminal ileum and cecum by a static infusion of a food hydrolysate in morbidly obese patients undergoing a duodenal switch procedure.

Setting
University Hospital.

Methods
Plasma levels of GLP-1, PYY, and leptin were obtained at 0, 30, 60, 90, and 120 minutes after instillation of 240 mL of a food hydrolysate into the ileum or cecum.

Results
The mean ± SD GLP-1 values by cecal stimulation for 0, 30, 60, 90, and 120 minutes were: 41.3 ± 23.2; 39.6 ± 21.8; 38.9 ± 19.1; 47.4 ± 22.3; 51.7 ± 27.3 pM, and by ileal stimulation: 55.0 ± 32.8; 83.4 ± 16.1; 78.7 ± 23.8; 84.7 ± 23.5; 76.4 ± 25.6. The mean ± SD PYY values by cecal stimulation were: 62.1 ± 24.8; 91.1 ± 32.8; 102.1 ± 39.6; 119.6 ± 37.5; 130.3 ± 36.7, and by ileal stimulation: 73.8 ± 41.6; 138.1 ± 17.7; 149.5 ± 23.3; 165.7 ± 24.3; 155.5 ± 29.1. Percent change in PYY levels increased ~150%, GLP-1 increased ~50%, and leptin decreased ~20%.

Conclusion
Direct stimulation of the human terminal ileum and cecum by a food hydrolysate elicits significant plasma GLP-1 and PYY elevations and leptin decreases, peaking at 90–120 minutes. The ileal GLP-1 and PYY responses exceed those of the cecum, and the PYY effect is about 3-fold that of GLP-1. The results of this study question the satiety premise for ileal transposition.

GLP-1PYYLeptinDuodenal switch
   The discipline of bariatric surgery evolved empirically from observation, patient experimentation, and subsequent outcomes dissemination by publication. Individuals with a markedly shortened intestine or a proximal alimentary tract obstruction lost weight. Applying this common knowledge by iatrogenic gastrointestinal restriction or massive gut exclusion met with weight loss success and the initiation of bariatric surgery [1]. After 30-plus years of clinical reports and founding of the 2 pioneer professional bariatric societies—American Society for Bariatric Surgery in 1983 and the International Federation for the Surgery of Obesity in 1995—the field began to appreciate that bariatric surgery was an aspect of metabolic surgery, similar to peptic ulcer surgery and hyperlipidemia surgery [2]. With this insight, and 2 milestone reports on the effect of metabolic/bariatric surgery on type 2 diabetes [3,4], a search for metabolic mechanisms of action rapidly gained momentum. The over simplified explanations of primarily restrictive, restrictive/malabsorptive, and primarily malabsorptive failed to provide a satisfactory understanding for the neurohormonal changes being described to accompany metabolic/bariatric surgery or to explain the effects of electronic gut stimulation on weight and obesity co-morbidities.

In addition to attempting to explain how the standard metabolic/bariatric operations elicit their weight and other metabolic effects, clinicians have been eager to use the newly elucidated hormonal knowledge to promote new operations. Primary among these experimental procedures are the duodenal-jejunal bypass [5,6] and ileal transposition into the jejunum or even the duodenum [7,8], each with a different primary objective. The former procedure bypasses the pylorus, duodenum, and proximal jejunum, mainly for excluding contact of food with the proximal bowel, whereas the latter specifically seeks rapid exposure of the ileum to food. Both innovations have in common earlier release from the ileum of the hormones glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) and peptide YY (PYY), both stated to effect satiety and type 2 diabetes.

To obtain basic knowledge and to offer experimental data for mechanisms, speculations, and procedures justification, we have obtained the blood levels of GLP-1, PYY, and leptin after stimulation of the terminal ileum and cecum by a static infusion of a food hydrolysate in morbidly obese patients undergoing a duodenal switch procedure.

Methods
Protocol
In an Institutional Review Board approved study, with fully informed patient consent, Nutren Liquid Nutrition (20 g protein, 49 g carbohydrate, 26 g fat, and vitamins) was instilled either into the terminal ileum or into the cecum during the performance of a scheduled open duodenal switch. Blood samples were obtained at baseline and at 0, 30, 60, 90, and 120 minutes for analysis of circulating GLP-1, PYY, and leptin.

Operative infusion technique
Subsequent to anesthesia induction and open exposure of the abdominal cavity, the Nutren hydrolysate infusion was carried out at the start of the duodenal switch procedure. The common channel (~100 cm from the ileocecal valve) and the biliopancreatic and enteric (Roux) limbs (~half each of the small bowel length proximal to the common channel) were identified by placement of transmesenteric marking sutures. When the terminal ileum was randomly selected for the hydrolysate infusion, encircling vascular loops were placed at the ileocecal junction and just below the marking suture for the proximal end of the common channel. The distal vascular loop was tightened to block flow into the cecum. An enterotomy was made into the ileum where the jejunoileostomy for the duodenal switch would be situated, a soft catheter threaded into the terminal ileum, and the 240 mL of infusate instilled through the catheter with the aid of an assistant outside the operative field. The proximal vascular loop below the enterotomy was then tightened to occlude the terminal ileum containing the hydrolysate. For the cecal instillation, the vascular loop at the ileocecal valve was tightened for proximal bowel occlusion (the cecum was not occluded distally), and the hydrolysate injected via a catheter through the base of the appendix before completion of the appendectomy. The 240 mL of infusate was infused over 2–3 minutes by hand pressure on the plunger of a 60-mL syringe. At the end of the operation, all vascular loops were removed. There were no untoward events in any of the subject patients.

GLP-1, PYY, leptin analyses
GLP-1, PYY, and leptin plasma concentration analyses by the enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay were conducted by the EMD Millipore Corporation (St. Charles, MO).

Statistics
Statistical analyses were performed by repeated measure analysis of variance (ANOVA) across time and between groups; multiple statistical derivations (e.g., confidence intervals, standard errors) are provided in the tables and figures, and P values are given in the text. P values &lt; .05 were considered significant.

Results
The number of patient samples, mean values, standard deviations, 95% confidence intervals, and minimal and maximum values for cecal and ileal infusions are shown in Table 1 for GLP-1, in Table 2 for PYY, and in Table 3 for leptin.

The mean ± SD GLP-1 values by cecal stimulation for 0, 30, 60, 90, and 120 minutes, were (rounded): 41.3 ± 23.2; 39.6 ± 21.8; 38.9 ± 19.1; 47.4 ± 22.3; and 51.7 ± 27.3 pM. The mean ± SD GLP-1 values by ileal stimulation for the same time intervals were 55.0 ± 32.8; 83.4 ± 16.1; 78.7 ± 23.8; 84.7 ± 23.5; and 76.4 ± 25.6 pM. Total GLP-1 concentration levels compared by repeated measures ANOVA for ileal to cecal stimulation for the same time intervals were P = .416, .007, .009, .019, and .145.

The mean ± SD PYY values by cecal stimulation for 0, 30, 60, 90, and 120 minutes were (rounded): 62.1 ± 24.8; 91.1 ± 32.8; 102.1 ± 39.6; 119.6 ± 37.5; and 130.3 ± 36.7. The mean ± SD PYY values by ileal stimulation for the same time intervals were 73.8 ± 41.6; 138.1 ± 17.7; 149.5 ± 23.3; 165.7 ± 24.3; and 155.5 ± 29.1. Total PYY concentration levels compared by repeated measures ANOVA for ileal to cecal stimulation for the same time intervals were P = .554, .016, .043, .037, and .232.

The mean ± SD leptin values by cecal stimulation for 0, 30, 60, 90, and 120 minutes were (rounded) −345 ± 104; −327 ± 107; −319 ± 115; −302 ± 100; and −285 ± 97. The mean ± SD leptin values for ileal stimulation for the same time intervals were: −344 ± 196; −276 ± 181; −278 ± 205; 257 ± 193; and −264 ± 250. Total leptin concentration levels compared by repeated measures ANOVA for ileal to cecal stimulation for the same time intervals were P = 0.90, .55, .71, .61, and .84.

Thus, total GLP-1 and PYY concentration levels only peaked after 90–120 minutes. Measured values were both significantly higher after ileal compared to cecal stimulation at 30, 60, and 90 minutes. The leptin concentrations decreased reciprocally to the GLP-1 and PYY values.

The percent change in GLP-1, PYY, and leptin levels post-stimulation are shown in Fig. 1. PYY levels after ileal stimulation rose above 150% at 90 minutes and then plateaued; PYY after cecal stimulation continued to rise and nearly reached 150% at 120 minutes. The GLP-1 levels rose concurrently but never exceeded 50%. The leptin levels consistently dropped below baseline reaching approximately −20% at 90 minutes. The steepest ascent slope for the PYY concentrations after both ileal and cecal stimulation was in the first 30 minutes with a less steep rise to their measured maximums. The steepest ascent slope for GLP-1 after ileal stimulation continued up to 60 minutes, where the GLP-1 concentration started to plateau. The steepest ascent for GLP-1 after cecal stimulation occurred after 60 minutes, between 60–90 minutes, and this concentration curve was still rising at 120 minutes.

Discussion
Currently, we have a plethora of information on gut and other hormones, incretins, vagal and complementary neural pathways, the gastric pacemaker, and hypothalamic functions, attempting to explain why metabolic/bariatric surgery works and how the different operative procedures influence these mechanisms. Based on these data, several hypotheses have emerged to explain mechanisms of action. Some of them are quite plausible but at times contradictory. We have yet to derive a unified, scientifically tested, hypothesis of causation that is also explanatory of the effects of intercession.

To move forward in this quest, we need to study in-depth portions of the total physiologic/biochemical mosaic of metabolic surgery and its subdivisions of bariatric surgery, diabetes surgery, etc. The actions of hormones, in particular the gastrointestinal hormones, have occupied extensive attention. Among them, the intestinal hormones GLP-1 and PYY have been well characterized, as has the adipocyte-derived cytokine leptin. GLP-1 and PYY, both elaborated by the L-cells of the intestinal mucosa, seem to work in concert, either eliciting the same metabolic responses or augmenting the actions of the other. Their infusion-elicited gastrointestinal properties include the reduction of hunger and increase in the sensation of satiety by stimulation of the hypothalamic arcuate nucleus [9–11]; and the “ileal brake” effect of delayed gastric emptying, delayed mouth to cecum transit time, and decreased jejunal wave pressure [12–14]. Curiously, PYY exhibits 2 active circulating forms: PYY (1–36), which essentially increases appetite and promotes weight gain, and PYY (3–36), formed from the cleavage of the tyrosine-proline residues from the N-terminal of the polypeptide, which does the opposite, centrally decreasing appetite and promoting weight loss [15–19]. PYY also inhibits pentagastrine-stimulated gastric acid secretion [20] and the cephalic phase of pancreatic exocrine secretion [21,22]. With respect to pancreatic endocrine function, GLP-1 and PYY contribute significantly to the incretin effect, defined as the concentration of insulin released by oral glucose stimulation that exceeds the insulin concentration elicited by the same amount of intravenous glucose [23]. PYY effects insulin secretion indirectly by inhibiting the action of gastrin-stimulating peptide and gastrin-releasing peptide [24,25]. The influence of GLP-1 on pancreatic endocrine function is more direct and appears to be more powerful. GLP-1 stimulates glucose-dependent insulin secretion, preinsulin gene expression, β-cell proliferation and antiapoptotic pathways, and inhibits glucagon release [26,27]. It has been shown that GLP-1 secretion is reduced in patients with type 2 diabetes [28,29], which may be responsible for the hyperglycemia of this disease [30].

The natural stimulation mechanisms for the release of GLP-1 and PYY into the bloodstream have been well studied. Both hormones are secreted in increasing amounts as a function of the caloric content of ingested food [31]. Influencing factors include the intestinal site of stimulation [32–34], bile acids [35], central neural and vagal mechanisms [36–38], and other hormones (vasoactive intestinal peptide, [39] gastrin [40]). GLP-1 and PYY are interdependent in a biofeedback autoregulation loop [41].

The relative intestinal secretion capacity for PYY has been well defined by Adrian et al [31]: 6 pmol/g in duodenum, 5 pmol/g in jejunum, 84 pmol/g in terminal ileum, and higher concentrations throughout the colon (ascending 82 pmol/g, sigmoid 196 pmol/g, rectum 480 pmol/g). It would appear that there is minimal proximal concentration of PYY with increasing concentrations in descending segments of bowel with essentially equal concentrations in the terminal ileum and cecum. These studies have been corroborated by immunoreactivity techniques [42–45].

Leptin forms a triad with GLP-1 and PYY in weight regulating mechanisms, possibly providing an autoregulatory function. Leptin stimulates GLP-1 secretion and GLP-1 suppresses leptin levels [46].

This study has shown that (1) direct stimulation of the human terminal ileum and cecum by a food hydrolysate elicits significant plasma GLP-1 and PYY elevations and leptin decreases over 120 minutes, (2) these responses peak at 90–120 minutes, (3) the ileal GLP-1 and PYY elevations exceed those of the cecum, and (4) the hydrolysate effect on the PYY plasma concentration is about 3-fold that of GLP-1.

The fact that both GLP-1 and PYY levels peaked only after 90–120 minutes by direct ileal and cecal stimulation make the effect of these hormones on immediate postprandial satiety questionable. It is unlikely that the translocation of a segment of ileum by ileal transposition would enhance the immediate postprandial release of GLP-1 and PYY over that obtained by direct stimulation in situ. The importance of these findings for metabolic surgery for type 2 diabetes is currently unclear. There are recent studies demonstrating limited deterioration of glucose tolerance on blockade of GLP-1 action [47,48]. These reports seem to diminish the importance of GLP-1 secretion in the amelioration of type 2 diabetes.

Both a strength and weakness of this study is the experimental condition under which it was performed. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first report of measurement of plasma GLP-1, PYY, and leptin levels after direct ileal and cecal stimulation by a food hydrolysate in humans and, in particular, obese humans. At the same time, the study was conducted under general anesthesia and in individuals who had been NPO for 12 hours. These factors could influence the hormonal release pattern tested by diminishing or augmenting the results. There are no known studies of the effects of anesthesia on the secretion of gut hormones. Furthermore, the study protocol does not truly replicate homeostatic human physiology. After all, ingested nutrients do not remain captive in a small segment of the gastrointestinal tract under normal circumstances. The bowel preparation (magnesium citrate) and the patients being NPO for 12 hours may also have an effect on gut hormone secretion. Finally, the obese human hormonal response may well be different from the response in nonobese patients, especially in those with type 2 diabetes.

Currently, ileal transposition is being practiced in obese patients or overweight patients with type 2 diabetes in the belief that the ileal hormonal effect will not only be beneficial but enhanced by moving an ileal segment higher in the gastrointestinal tract. It may be so, however, this assumption is not supported by the findings of this study. Furthermore, the proponents of ileal transposition seem to give little credence to the studies showing that duodenal stimulation, either by direct GLP-1 and PYY release from the L-cells located in the duodenum or by stimulation of the distal gastrointestinal tract via a neuro syncytium or a hormonal messenger [49,50], elicits an equivalent GLP-1 and PYY response to that of the ileum before the nutrients reach the ileum [36,49,51,52]. Finally, in a study in Goto-Kakizaki rats, we have found a statistically significant rise in the postprandial plasma GLP-1 levels after ileal excision (unpublished data). Thus, these animals totally deprived of their ileum exhibit the response hoped for by ileal transposition.

Research based on metabolic surgery is building a database of hormonal findings that will, in time, help to explain the precise mechanisms for metabolic/bariatric operations and possibly the etiologies of obesity and type 2 diabetes.

This study was funded by a Research Service Pilot grant from University of Minnesota Clinical and Translational Science Institute (CTSI).
