        The antioxidant activity and nutritional composition of four dehydrated soups (vegetables, meat, chicken and fish) packaged in four formats &#x2014; carton, plastic, and aluminium bags (the last with and without modified atmosphere) &#x2014; were evaluated during 12&#xA0;months&#x2019; storage. The results showed that all four soups had a good or very good antioxidant capacity as tested by the lipid peroxidation, deoxyribose, and Trolox equivalent antioxidant capacity (TEAC) tests. Of interest from a nutritional point of view was the finding that the lipid fraction of all the soups was below 1&#xA0;%. The sodium content of the four soups and their ingredients was also analysed. By modifying some of the ingredients, a 25&#xA0;% reduction in the sodium content of the soups was obtained, permitting them to be labelled as &#x201C;sodium reduced&#x201D;. The monosodium glutamate (MSG) content of the reformulated soups (lower sodium content) was below levels permitted by European legislation.
