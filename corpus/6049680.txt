        The aim of this study was to identify of antimicrobial substances from Korean Lettuce (Youngia sonchifolia M.). Water and ethanol extracts of Youngia sonchifolia M. exhibited antimicrobial activities against the microorganisms tested. Ethanol extract showed strong antimicrobial activities against most Gram positive and Gram negative microorganisms, whereas no lactic acid bacteria and yeasts were not affected. The antimicrobial compound G-6 was isolated from the ethyl acetate fraction obtained by silica gel column chromatography and HPLC and was confirmed as stable against heat treatment. Molecular weight of G-6 was calculated as 154&#xA0;kDa based on information in the MS spectrum. G-6 was identified as 2-nonynoic acid (C9H14O2) by UV, LC-EI/MS, and LC-CI/MS. In support of this, the chromatogram of G-6 was consistent with that of the 2-nonynoic acid standard. Antimicrobial activity of 2-nonynoic acid was identified in all samples, with a significant difference based on concentratio.
