Many people have dental arches with unrestored edentulous areas posterior to natural teeth. One dental pattern is the shortened dental arch (SDA) Due to the lack of teeth, individuals with a SDA may eat a restricted diet including soft, highly processed foods. Such diets may increase the risk of overweight or obesity. We examined the SDA and body mass index (BMI) to determine if there was an association in adults aged 45–65 years.

Methods
The data for this study were U.S. National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) 2005–2008 merged files. There were 5,773 eligible participants. The data were examined for frequencies, and with Chi square and logistic regression.

Results
There were 69.3% of participants with a shortened mandibular arch who had a BMI ≥ 25 as compared with 71.8% of participants who had a complete mandibular dental arch who had a BMI ≥ 25; (p = .7246). There were 70.6% of participants with a shortened maxillary arch who had a BMI ≥ 25 as compared with 71.9% of participants who had a complete maxillary dental arch who had a BMI ≥ 25 (p= .8859). The adjusted odds ratio for shortened mandibular dental arch was 0.70 (95% CI: 0.46, 1.08) on BMI ≥ 25. The adjusted odds ratio for shortened maxillary dental arch was 1.06 (0.63, 1.78).

Conclusions
The research hypothesis that SDA was related to higher BMI, and the corollary that restored or complete dentition had better odds of a lower BMI were not supported.

   Introduction
The World Health Organization’s researchers estimated that 30% of the world’s adult population, ages 65–74 years, is edentulous.1 There is a downward trend in edentulism by birth cohorts in the US.2 In 1957–58, the prevalence of edentulism was 18.9% of the population ages 15 years and above.2 In 2009–12 the prevalence was 4.9% .2 The decline was primarily due to the passing of cohorts born prior to 1940.2 The projected edentulism prevalence in 2050 is 2.6% of the population due largely to the passing of the cohorts born after 1940.2

As a result of the downward trend of edentulism, a variety of dental arch tooth patterns are becoming more frequent. Many people have dental arches with unrestored edentulous areas posterior to natural teeth. The pattern is referred to as a shortened dental arch (SDA) under these conditions:

There are occluding anterior teeth (6 occluding pairs).

There are unilateral or bilateral edentulous area(s) posterior to the most distal tooth (unilaterally) or teeth (bilaterally).

The edentulous area(s) has (have) not been restored.3

There is no agreed upon number of missing posterior teeth in the definition of SDA. Kayser in the 1980’s recognized 4 occluding pairs as the point between adequate oral function and inadequate oral function.4,5 Some researchers have defined a unilateral shortened dental arch as having the most distal tooth anterior to the edentulous space being an ipsilateral canine, premolar, or first molar; and, a bilateral shortened dental arch as having the edentulous spaces being the canines, premolars, first molars, or various combinations of these teeth.3 Other researchers choose to use ten occluding pairs of naturally and replacement teeth to define shortened dental arch.6 Researchers in a recent study chose to develop four scenarios (missing second molars, missing molars, missing molars and second premolars, and missing molars and premolars) rather than to specifically define shortened dental arch.7

A researcher of a systematic review found SDA defined variously with different combinations of missing premolars and molars in the selected studies.8 In another review of the SDA literature, the researchers found studies in which the SDA definition was zero to eight occluding pairs; ten occluding pairs; and 4 occluding pairs.9 They reported that there was adaptive capacity for oral function in SDA if at least 4 symmetrically placed occluding pairs exist.9 The suggestion was that, in the US and other industrialized countries, food industries have processed food to the extent that chewing is less important.3

A possibility exists that individuals with a SDA may eat a restricted diet including many soft, highly processed foods. Often such diets consist of refined, calorie-laden items which increase the risk of being overweight or obese. There are 34.9% (78.6 million) US adults who are obese--32.2% of US men and 35.5% of US women. 10,11 Heart disease, stroke, diabetes, and some types of cancers are associated with being overweight.10 The annual medical costs of obesity were $147 billion in 2008 dollars.10

Since being obese or overweight is related to many health problems, and it is unknown if SDA increases the likelihood of obesity and overweight, the researchers for this study examined SDA and body mass index (BMI) to determine if there is an association of SDA and overweight or obesity in a group of individuals aged 45–65 years.

Individuals aged 45–65 years were more likely to be exposed to community water fluoridation and toothpastes with fluoride during their youth than individuals over age 65 years and are more likely to be part of the trend of adults who maintain their teeth as they age.

Methods
This study received acknowledgement from the West Virginia University Institutional Review Board (protocol number 1505675830) as non-human subject, secondary data analysis research not requiring Institutional Review Board approval. The research has been conducted in full accordance with the World Medical Association Declaration of Helsinki. The data used in this study were de-identified and anonymized prior to analysis and are publicly available U.S. National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) merged files from 2005–2008 data. The NHANES is a complex, national survey of non-institutionalized US residents. The NHANES researchers utilized questionnaires, examinations, and laboratory studies. They over-sampled for adequate sample sizes to represent population sub-groups in data analyses. Dental examiners in 2005–2008 evaluated tooth count and the presence or absence of removable dental prostheses (Dental examinations in previous and following years did not include dental prostheses data).

The sample population was limited to individuals with complete data on tooth count (to determine SDA status, the presence of a complete arch, the presence of edentulism, or the presence of other arch patterns), age 45–65 years, complete data on prosthetic replacement (yes or no) and complete data on BMI (&lt;25 or 25+). Participants were limited to the birth cohort who were ages 45–65 years at the time of the study who were considered to be more likely to be part of the trend of adults who maintain their teeth as they age. Older adults were excluded as having the potential to over-represent edentulism, and younger adults were excluded as having the potential to over-represent individuals with all teeth present. There were 5,773 eligible participants. The data were analyzed to determine frequency, and were analyzed with Chi square, and complex survey logistic regression.

The key dependent variable was BMI. Overweight and obesity were defined as a BMI of 25 or above. Normal weight was defined as a BMI less than 25. The key independent variable was dental arch. Dental arches were defined as shortened dental arches, edentulous dental arches, complete dental arches, and other dental arches.

Eight forms of SDA have been reported:

“slightly shortened” dental arch has at least one missing first molar with a distal unrestored edentulous area;

“ shortened dental arch I” has a second premolar with a distal unrestored edentulous area on one side of the arch and the contralateral side has a first, second or third molar present;

“shortened dental arch II” has a second premolar with a distal unrestored edentulous area on one side of the arch and the contralateral side has a first or second premolar with a distal unrestored edentulous area;

“extreme shortened dental arch I” has first premolars bilaterally with distal unrestored edentulous areas;

“extreme shortened dental arch II” has a canine with a distal unrestored edentulous area on one side of the arch and the contralateral side has a canine or first premolar with a distal unrestored edentulous area;

“asymmetric shortened dental arch I” has a first premolar with a distal unrestored edentulous area on one side of the arch and the contralateral side has a first, second, or third molar with a distal unrestored edentulous area;

“asymmetric shortened dental arch II” has a canine with a distal unrestored edentulous area on one side of the arch and the contralateral side has a first, second or third molar with a distal unrestored edentulous area;

“asymmetric shortened dental arch III” has a canine with a distal unrestored edentulous area on one side of the arch and the contralateral side has a second premolar with a distal unrestored edentulous area.3

In this study, the eight forms of SDA in combination and individually, and second premolar occlusion with occluding anterior teeth were studied in association with BMI. Other variables were selected for adjusted analyses as they had been previously been shown to be associated with BMI. These included sex (female, male); race/ethnicity (Non-Hispanic white, Non-Hispanic black, Mexican American, other); age (45–54 years, 55–65 years); education (less than high school, high school graduate, some college/technical school, college/technical school graduate); family income to poverty ratio (0 to less than 1.25, 1.25 to less than 2.00, 2.00 to less than 4.00, 4.00 and above); alcohol consumption (non-use, moderate use, heavy use); smoking status (current, former, never); and moderate exercise (yes, no).

The data were analyzed with SAS (version 9.3, Cary, NC) for frequency, and were analyzed with Rao Scott Chi Square, and logistic regression on BMI for complex surveys. Weights were used in the analyses.

Results
The sample size was 5,773 participants. There were 1,311 participants with complete maxillary dentition. There were 304 participants with a maxillary SDA using the definition in which unilateral SDA has the most distal tooth anterior to the edentulous space being an ipsilateral canine, premolar, or first molar; and, a bilateral shortened dental arch as having the edentulous spaces being the canines, premolars, first molars, or various combinations of these teeth. The sample also included 1,279 participants with an edentulous maxillary arch, and 2,879 participants with other types of maxillary arches. The sample description of arch types is presented in Table 1. (The limited sample size of the subtypes of SDA, and of SDA defined as “anterior and premolar occlusion” prohibited further analysis beyond description for these types.)

The sample included 1,343 participants with complete mandibular dentition. There were 626 participants with mandibular SDA using the above definition. The sample also included 837 participants with an edentulous mandibular arch, and 2,967 participants with other types of mandibular arches. (The limited sample size of the subtypes of SDA, and of SDA defined as “anterior and premolar occlusion” prohibited further analysis beyond description for these types.)

There were 1,543 participants who had a BMI of &lt;25 and 4,230 participants who had a BMI which was 25+. The complete sample description is presented in Table 2.

The weighted percentages from Rao Scott Chi Square bivariate analysis were: 70.6% of participants with a maxillary SDA who were overweight or obese; 72.4% of participants with an edentulous maxillary arch who were overweight or obese; 71.9% of participants who had all of their maxillary teeth who were overweight or obese; and 71.0% of participants with other types of maxillary teeth patterns who were overweight or obese (p= .8859).

There were 69.3% of participants with a mandibular SDA who were also overweight or obese; 72.5% of participants with an edentulous mandibular arch who were overweight or obese; 71.8% of participants who had all of their mandibular teeth who were overweight or obese; and 71.6% of participants with other types of mandibular teeth patterns who were overweight or obese (p = .7246). The frequencies and results of the other variables in the bivariate analyses are presented in detail in Table 3.

The unadjusted odds ratio for the logistic regression of the maxillary SDA on BMI was 0.94 (95% CI: 0.69, 1.28). An adjusted model was developed in which the following variables were added: sex (male v. female); race/ethnicity (Non-Hispanic black, Mexican American, Other v. Non-Hispanic white); education (high school or less than high school, v. more than high school); age (55–65 years v. 45–54 years); family income to poverty ratio (less than 2 v. 2 and above); smoking (current, or former smoker v. never smoker); alcohol consumption (moderate, heavy v. no consumption); and moderate exercise (yes v. no). This model had an adjusted odds ratio of 1.06 (95% CI: 0.63, 1.78). A second model was created which also included the status of the opposing arch (shortened dental arch, edentulous, other v. complete dental arch). The second model had an adjusted odds ratio of 1.14 (95% CI: 0.65, 2.02).

The unadjusted odds ratio for the logistic regression of the mandibular SDA on BMI was 0.8994 (95% CI: 0.70, 1.12). An adjusted model was developed in which the following variable were added: sex (male v. female); race/ethnicity (Non-Hispanic black, Mexican American, Other v. Non-Hispanic white); education (high school or less than high school, v. more than high school); age (55–65 years v. 45–54 years); family income to poverty ratio (less than 2 v. 2 and above); smoking (current, or former smoker v. never smoker); alcohol consumption (moderate, heavy v. no consumption); and moderate exercise (yes v. no). This model had an adjusted odds ratio of 0.70 (95% CI: 0.46, 1.078). A second model was created which also included the status of the opposing arch (shortened dental arch, edentulous, other v. complete dental arch). The second model had an adjusted odds ratio of 0.65 (95% CI: 0.37, 1.11). Logistic regressions are presented in tabular form in Table 4.

Discussion
The results of this study failed to reject the null hypothesis that there was no difference in the odds ratio for SDA on overweight or obese BMI status as compared with the odds ratio for complete dentition on overweight or obese BMI status. The study is the first, to the authors’ knowledge, in which BMI and SDA were evaluated for an association in working-age adults, aged 45–65 years.

Bernardo, et al., conducted a study of 1,720 Brazilian working-age adults, ages 20–59 years, which involved tooth loss (rather than shortened dental arch) as the key independent variable and BMI as the outcome; the association was not statistically significant with age in the adjusted model.12 The results of Bernardo, et al., are similar to the results of this current study.

However, in a study of 2,816 Swedish men and women, ages 30–74 years, there was an association of tooth loss and BMI.13 The Swedish study differed from the current study in that tooth loss, rather than shortened dental arch, was the key independent variable.

Other researchers studied BMI as the independent variable with tooth loss as the dependent variable. In one such study, conducted among working-age Brazilian adults, there were no statistically significant associations in adjusted analyses of tooth loss and overweight/obesity.14 In an older adult population in Brazil, there was an association of more teeth present and a lesser likelihood of obesity.

This current study is important in that identifying evidence-based justification for treatment is important. There may be other reasons to consider for treating the shortened dental arch. As examples of reasons for treating the shortened dental arch, aesthetics may be a concern, oral health-related quality of life may be a concern,15 chewing difficulty may be a concern,16 and nutritional status may be a concern.17 However, in the evaluation of BMI and SDA, the researchers did not determine a difference between individuals with a SDA and individuals with complete dentition in terms of BMI as a determinate for treating SDA.

The study strengths include the use of several years of a large, nationally representative survey with examination data as well as questionnaire data. Study weaknesses include the limitations imposed by cross-sectional data collection in which temporality and causality cannot be determined. Although multiple years were included in the analyses, subgroup samples of various forms of SDA did not have adequate sample size to determine if specific SDA patterns were related to BMI and increasing the sample size was not possible by including more years of NHANES data because recent NHANES data did not include information concerning the presence of maxillary/mandibular dental prostheses. Although the NHANES data for 2005–2008 contained information about prostheses, it did not contain information about periodontal status which could possibly influence the type of foods selected and ultimately the BMI.

We failed to reject the null hypothesis that the odds ratio for SDA on overweight or obese BMI status would be the same as the odds ratio for complete dentition. The research hypothesis that SDA would be related to higher BMI, and the corollary that restored or complete dentition had better odds of a lower BMI were not supported in this study.
