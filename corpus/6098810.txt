        This study evaluated the effect of bambara groundnut supplementation on the physicochemical properties of local rice flour and baked crackers. Bulk and true density, porosity, water absorption index, oil absorption capacity, pasting properties by RVA, morphological appearance by SEM, color by calorimetry, and textural properties by TA.XT2 analysis of wheat and two formulations of rice&#x2013;legume flours and crackers were studied. Moisture (10.94%) and carbohydrate (77.42%) levels were significantly greater in wheat flour than the rice&#x2013;legume flours, while the reverse was true for fat and ash. Also rice&#x2013;legume flours had significantly greater water and oil absorption capacity and lower water solubility compared to wheat flour. Compared to wheat crackers, rice&#x2013;legume crackers had greater fat and ash, 20.51 and 3.57%, respectively, while moisture was significantly lower in the rice&#x2013;legume crackers by 41 to 58%. Rice legume crackers were significantly harder and had significantly increased spread ratio. The results obtained from the development of locally grown rice and underutilized legume bambara groundnut showed great promise in physicochemical and functional properties and may be a good replacement for wheat flour to serve as a gluten-free product.
