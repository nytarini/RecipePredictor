        Northeastern Chinese sauerkraut is a well-known traditional fermented vegetable in China. Incomplete identification of the microorganisms&#x2019; (bacteria in spontaneous fermentation) diversity and accumulation of nitrite make it difficult to normalize the fermentation process and product qualities of northeastern Chinese sauerkraut. Conventional culturing and polymerase chain reaction-denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis methods were combined to describe microbial structure and diversity. Lactobacillus, Leuconostoc, Enterobacter, Accumulibacter, Thermotoga, Pseudomonas, Clostridium, Rahnella and Citrobacter were predominant microorganisms in different fermentation periods. The pH value and nitrite concentration presented&#xA0;a&#xA0;certain&#xA0;relevance&#xA0;to&#xA0;the amount of lactic&#xA0;acid&#xA0;bacteria. Lactobacillus and Leuconostoc had the ability to decrease nitrite by inhibiting nitrate-reducing bacteria such as Enterobacter. Therefore, Northeastern Chinese sauerkraut should not be eaten until 4&#xA0;weeks of fermentation for the safety and quality of fermented foods. Northeastern Chinese sauerkraut is rich in lactic&#xA0;acid&#xA0;bacteria, which demonstrate its ability as an excellent probiotic for applications in functional foods.
