        The objective of the present study was to improve the quality of mozzarella cheese using whey protein concentrates (WPCs) hydrolyzed for varying lengths of time (1 and 3&#xA0;h). Four types of cheeses were made incorporating hydrolyzed WPCs in milk 3 and 6&#xA0;% level and evaluated for nutritional, structural, and functional properties during 28&#xA0;days storage at 4&#xA0;&#xB0;C. Whey protein hydrolysates (WPHs) incorporation increased protein, lactose, minerals, water-soluble-protein, non-protein-nitrogen. Mozzarella incorporated with WPHs hydrolyzed for 3&#xA0;h had higher fat contents, favorable meltability and lower browning effect, stretchability, brittleness, springiness, and cohesiveness compared to mozzarella fortified with WPHs hydrolyzed for 1&#xA0;h. The incorporation of hydrolyzed WPCs significantly influenced rheological and functional characteristics of mozzarella cheese. The cheeses made with hydrolyzed WPCs showed fewer changes in whiteness than control during storage. It was observed that both extent of hydrolysis and levels of WPHs incorporation had significant effect on the characteristics of mozzarella cheeses.
