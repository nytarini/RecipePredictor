        The freezing of the food is one of the most important technological developments for the storage of food in terms of quality and safety. The aim of this work was to study the role of an ice structuring protein (ISP) on freezing&#x2013;thawing cycles of different solutions and commercial Italian pasta sauces. Ice structuring proteins were related to the modification of the structure of ice. The results showed that the freezing time of an aqueous solution containing the protein was reduced to about 20% with respect to a pure water solution. The same effect was demonstrated in sugar-containing solutions and in lipid-containing sauces. The study proved a specific role of ISP during thawing, inducing a time decrease similar to that of freezing and even more important in the case of tomato-based sauces. This work demonstrated the role of ISP in the freezing&#x2013;thawing process, showing a significant reduction of processing in the freezing and thawing phase by adding the protein to pure water and different sugar-, salt- and lipid-containing solutions and commercial sauces, with considerable benefits for the food industry in terms of costs and food quality.
