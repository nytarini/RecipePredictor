   We thank Drs. Shiue and Sands for their interest in our article and for raising an important point. We agree that clinical pharmacists often play a critical role in stroke teams, in the acute stroke care setting, inpatient stroke units, and outpatient clinics. Indeed, there are multiple other specialists that could be highlighted as well: for example, specialized physical and occupational therapists and speech pathologists, and clinical nutritionists. However, the unique role that clinical pharmacists can play in the acute stroke setting deserves mention and we thank the authors for bringing this up. At present none of the Brain Attack Coalition recommendations for primary stroke centers, comprehensive stroke centers, or acute stroke ready hospitals mention clinical pharmacists as necessary members of the acute stroke team1-3. However, there is evidence that pharmacists can improve acute stroke care4, and further research directed at confirming that pharmacists improve the care of stroke patients may lead to more formal recommendations that pharmacists become recognized as members of the stroke team.

We also thank Drs. Cooper, Tsui, and Bailey for reporting their recent findings regarding the impressive diagnostic acumen of their stroke nurse practitioners (SNPs). We look forward to learning more about this approach to stroke care, and wonder whether the authors have analyzed the duration of time in position as a predictor of diagnostic accuracy. In other words, how long does it take for SNPs to acquire this proficiency in stroke? In addition, what type of training is involved? Have the authors developed a specific curriculum for their SNPs to follow, with benchmarks for readiness to practice independently? Have alternative approaches been tried? It appears to us that this field is ripe for investigation and we hope the authors will continue to explore these questions and share their results.
