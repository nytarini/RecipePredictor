ent chlorophyll (Chl)
in higher plants furnishes linear tetrapyrroles, classified as phyllobilins
(PBs), which resemble bilins, the degradation products of heme.1&#x2212;3 Chl breakdown is particularly visible in autumn, when deciduous
trees and bushes display the fascinating &#x201C;fall&#x201D; colors
or when fruit are ripening. Despite its visibility, Chl degradation
had remained obscure until roughly three decades ago, when the first
structure of a presumed colorless chlorophyll catabolite was elucidated.4 Nowadays, over 50 different colorless Chl catabolites
from senescent leaves of a wide variety of higher plant species have
been identified and their structures have been characterized.3,5 In the earlier investigations, only colorless compounds were identified
as the breakdown products of chlorophyll, which were either blue fluorescent
or nonluminescent and were hence named &#x201C;fluorescent&#x201D;
Chl catabolites (FCCs) or &#x201C;nonfluorescent&#x201D; Chl catabolites
(NCCs), respectively.5 However, more recently,
yellow pigments were discovered as further Chl degradation products,
named yellow Chl catabolites (YCCs) originally,6 and were also classified as belonging to the phylloxanthobilins
(PxBs).5 The PxBs have the same chromophore
as the heme-catabolite bilirubin (BR) and possess some similarly remarkable
chemical and physical properties.5 PxBs
are readily oxidized to pink-colored Chl catabolites (PiCC), the phylloroseobilins
(PrBs), which have also been detected in the extracts of senescent
leaves.7
      As established in the past
three decades, Chl degradation follows
a basically common &#x201C;pheophorbide a oxygenase/phyllobilin (PAO/PB)
pathway&#x201D; during &#x201C;normal&#x201D; leaf senescence and
fruit ripening (see Scheme 1). The enzyme PAO achieves the crucial oxidative opening of
the macrocycle of pheophorbide a (Pheo a), generating the &#x201C;red&#x201D; Chl catabolite (RCC)8 as the first bilin-type precursor of the colorless
phyllobilins (PBs),9,10 which is also related to a red
Chl catabolite from the green alga Auxenochlorella
protothecoides.11

      In senescent
leaves, Chl degradation starts by the enzymatic reduction
of Chl b to Chl a,12 followed by the removal of the central Mg ion by &#x201C;stay-green&#x201D;
enzymes SGR1/SGR2.3 A previously suggested
formation of chlorophyllide by the action of chlorophyllase, however,
seems to be unrelated to the senescence-induced Chl breakdown in the
leaves.13 Pheophytin, the product of SGR-catalyzed
Mg removal, is hydrolyzed by pheophytinase (PPH) to Pheo a.2,14 The red Chl catabolite (RCC), obtained by the oxidative
cleavage of Pheo a by PAO, is directly converted
by RCC reductase (RCCR)3 to a colorless
&#x201C;primary&#x201D; fluorescent catabolite (pFCC).15 The pFCC is hydroxylated
at its 32-position by a Rieske-type oxygenase at the inner
chloroplast membrane,16 which was originally
named translocon at the inner chloroplast envelope 55 (TIC55). After
export into the cytosol, FCCs are further modified and then imported
into the vacuoles,3,5 where an acid-induced isomerization
(ISO) of the FCCs to the corresponding NCCs takes place.5,17 This isomerization is inhibited in &#x201C;hypermodified&#x201D;
FCCs (hmFCCs), which accumulate in the peels of ripening
banana, making them glow with a blue fluorescence.18,19
      The disappearance of Chl and the senescence of leaves are
induced
by developmental and abiotic causes, such as drought and lack of light,
in addition to biotic stresses, such as pest infestation.3 The latter is of high economic importance in
the agricultural sector. Methods for monitoring of chlorophyll disappearance
by measuring the optical changes near 700 nm have received considerable
interest.20,21 In recent years, methods were developed
for remote sensing of crop infestation using satellite and airplane
data to establish vegetation indices, to distinguish between healthy
and infested plants using differences in leaf spectral transmittance
or reflectance without the need for costly on-site surveillance and
controls.22,23
      Although improved methods are being
developed for detecting leaf
chlorosis as a consequence of pest infestation and applying those
to distinguish between different infectants, the mechanisms behind
Chl breakdown triggered by pathogens are still hardly understood.24 Whether the biochemical formation of phyllobilins
in the course of senescence-associated chlorophyll degradation is
triggered by herbivores or pathogens has remained obscure. In the
leaves of apple and apricot trees infected with phytoplasmoses, the
PAO/PB pathway of Chl degradation was indicated to be operating, and
the Chl catabolites identified in healthy and infested plants showed
no structural differences. This study provided the first evidence
that pathogen-induced Chl breakdown produced NCCs via the PAO/PB pathway
of senescence-induced Chl breakdown.24 However,
studies on the expression of Chl catabolic enzymes involved in leaf
chlorosis triggered by herbivore attack are still sparse. In fact,
earlier work in Diuraphis noxia-infested
wheat plants on a possible chlorophyllase activity turned out negative;
therefore, the authors hypothesized that the disappearance of Chl
elicited by herbivores is different from senescence-induced de-greening.
They found, however, an increase in Mg-dechelatase activity upon aphid
feeding on the plants.25 Another study
in a different wheat line could detect Mg-dechelating as well as chlorophyllase
activity in response to aphid infestation.26 Chlorophyllase, however, has been shown not to be involved in senescence-induced
Chl degradation in the leaves.2 It has
been proposed to play a role in plant defense by producing chlorophyllide
as a protecting agent against herbivores chewing the leaves.13 In contrast, a correlation between the expression
levels of SGR and a hypersensitive response-related cell death induced
by Pseudomonas syringae was found in Arabidopsis thaliana, leading to accelerated kinetics
of cell death with higher expression levels.27 Furthermore, the reduced levels of PAO were shown to lead to the
accumulation of Pheo a, a phototoxic Chl catabolite
that can generate singlet oxygen, possibly contributing to the hypersensitive
response.3
      The colorless NCCs typically
accumulate in senescent leaves,5 and NCCs
were considered earlier to represent
the &#x201C;final Chl-detoxification&#x201D; products of the PAO/PB
pathway.28 However, the discovery of yellow-colored
phylloxanthobilins (PxBs)6,29 indicated the pathway
to proceed further, beyond the colorless catabolites.5 YCCs are produced in leaves by an abundant, but still hardly
characterized oxidative &#x201C;activity&#x201D;.30,31 The first studies on the possible bioactivities of PBs from ripe
apples and pears have revealed the remarkable antioxidative activities
of NCCs.32 YCCs were described very recently
as more powerful antioxidants5 and were
shown to protect cells from oxidative stress,33 suggesting PxBs to be of particular interest in terms of their physiological
activities.5,33&#x2212;35
      Here,
we describe an analysis of the PBs in the leaves of (sweet)
basil (Ocimum basilicum L. subsp. basilicum).
Thanks to its various constituents, (sweet) basil is not only used
as a culinary herb in many cuisines around the world but also relevant
as a medicinal plant, being appreciated for its antioxidative, antimicrobial,
antiviral, and larvicidal properties.36,37 Several studies
have dealt with the phytochemical analysis of basil leaves, many of
which focus on essential oils.38 In aqueous
leaf extracts, compounds of further pharmacological relevance were
identified, such as saponins, tannins, and alkaloids.39 The analysis of partially de-greened basil leaves led to
the detection of several PBs, which were structurally identified as
products of the PAO/PB pathway of Chl breakdown (see Figure 1).

        Figure 1

          (A) Photo of the two
basil plants that were used for phyllobilin
analysis. The green plant on the right was acquired fresh, and the
naturally senescent yellowish-green plant on the left was kept for
a further 15 days in partial shade (see Materials
and Methods). (B) High-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC)
analysis of an extract of a yellowish-green basil leaf with detection
at 320 nm indicated the presence of four NCCs (Ob-NCC-35, Ob-NCC-36, Ob-NCC-40,
and Ob-NCC-47) and of Ob-YCC-45
(labeled by full circles or by a triangle, respectively; analytical
HPLC system I; see the Supporting Information (SI).

      Two PBs, a colorless NCC and a
(yellow) YCC, were rather abundant
in the naturally senescent leaves. Their detailed spectroscopic analysis
revealed them to feature an unprecedented structure. We also investigated
the spatial distribution and identity of the Chl catabolites upon
infestation of the basil plant and showed that the PBs that were detected
in the infested parts of a leaf were identical to those found in the
healthy part of the leaf. In the infested parts, the amounts of the
studied NCC and YCC were, however, significantly higher compared to
those of the healthy parts.

        Isolation of Ob-NCC-40 and Ob-YCC-45
for Spectroscopic Analysis
        Leaves weighing 24.5
g of two yellowish-green basil plants (Figure 1) were deep-frozen in liquid nitrogen and
ground in a mortar and pestle. The resulting powder was extracted
in 80 mL of MeOH, and the slurry was centrifuged for 10 min at 4000
rpm. The supernatant was collected, and the extraction was repeated
using 70 mL of MeOH. The combined methanolic extracts were filtered
through a Buchner funnel. After washing the extract two times with n-hexane (1 &#xD7; 75 mL, 1 &#xD7; 50 mL), the methanolic
solution was concentrated to 30 mL using a rotary evaporator. The
solution was diluted with 100 mL H2O and centrifuged for
2 min at 4000 rpm. The supernatant was diluted with 120 mL H2O, applied to a preconditioned SepPak-cartridge (5 g), and washed
with 10 mL H2O. After eluting the sample with 10 mL MeOH,
the solution was concentrated to 3 mL using a rotary evaporator. The
residue was isolated by semipreparative HPLC. Fifteen consecutive
HPLC runs were performed, and the fractions containing Ob-NCC-40 or Ob-YCC-45 were collected. The combined Ob-NCC-40 fractions, diluted with 150 mL H2O,
were applied to a preconditioned SepPak-cartridge (5 g). After washing
with 20 mL H2O, the Ob-NCC-40 was eluted
with 7 mL MeOH. The solvents were removed using a rotary evaporator
and by drying under high vacuum, furnishing 2.9 &#x3BC;mol of Ob-NCC-40. Likewise, the combined Ob-YCC-45
fractions were diluted with 150 mL H2O and applied to a
preconditioned SepPak cartridge (5 g). After washing with 10 mL H2O, Ob-YCC-45 was eluted with 5 mL MeOH. The
solvents were removed using a rotary evaporator and by drying under
high vacuum, furnishing 0.98 &#x3BC;moles of Ob-YCC-45.
        For a separate NMR spectroscopic analysis of Ob-YCC-45, 99 g (in total) of fresh or frozen yellowish-green basil
leaves was extracted in four batches. The fresh leaf material was
ground with liquid nitrogen in a mortar and pestle and suspended with
a solvent mixture consisting of 40% MeOH and 60% potassium phosphate
buffer 50 mM, pH 5.2. The frozen leaves were put into a beaker and
mixed in a blender with a chilled solvent mixture (100 mL of the solvent
mixture was used for 25 g of the leaf material). The mixtures were
incubated at RT for 1 h and then centrifuged for 10 min at 5 krpm.
The solid residues were washed with 50 mL of the chilled solvent mixture,
and the pooled supernatants were filtrated. The clear solution was
then acidified to pH 3.5 by the addition of chilled 50% acetic acid
(3&#x2013;5 mL). The solution was then stirred at RT in the dark for
3&#x2013;5 h (the conversion of NCC to YCC was monitored by analytical
HPLC). After that time, the mixture was filtered over a celite layer,
and an SPE step was carried out (Phenomenex 5g RP 18 cartridge, elution
with MeOH). The eluate was diluted with phosphate buffer 50 mM, pH
7, and purified by semipreparative HPLC (flow 2.5 ml/min, solvent
composition 15% MeCN/85% of 10 mM NH4OAc, pH 7, t = 0&#x2013;2 min, to 28% MeCN by t = 3 min, and to 38%
MeCN by t = 23 min). For all four batches, a second round of semipreparative
HPLC was carried out using the alternative solvent composition of
40% MeOH/60% of 50 mM potassium phosphate, pH 7, at time zero to 70%
MeOH/30% of 50 mM potassium phosphate, pH 7, at t = 25 min. The purity of all four batches was controlled by analytical
HPLC prior to pooling the batches containing Ob-YCC-45
and desalting the pooled solutions by SPE. The methanolic eluate (7
ml) was first concentrated on a rotary evaporator at 25 &#xB0;C and
then lyophilized. Ob-YCC-45 of 0.70 &#x3BC;mol was
obtained.

        Phyllobilin Determination in Aphid-Infested
Basil Leaves
        Green aphids were collected from an infested
orchid (courtesy of
G&#xE4;rtnerei Zanker, Buchendorf, Germany) and transferred to an
organic basil. After approximately 1 week, the infestation had spread.
Six leaves from three different plants were used for analysis (the
infestation was transferred by placing the new plant next to the infested
one).
        Each of the yellow and green patches of a leaf (Figure 5) was cut out with
a scalpel, transferred to Eppendorf vials, and weighed (around 30
mg of the leaf material was used per sample). Fifty microliters of
methanol and 150 &#x3BC;L of phosphate buffer 100 mM, pH 7, were added
per sample, followed by approximately 50 &#x3BC;L of acid-washed glass
beads (0.5 mm diameter, Sigma-Aldrich). The mixtures were vortexed
for 1 min. After centrifugation on a table-top centrifuge at the maximum
speed for 3 min at 4 &#xB0;C, the supernatants were directly applied
to analytical HPLC (analytical HPLC System I). To measure the total
NCC and YCC contents from the HPLC peak areas, NCC and YCC signals
were identified by their UV/vis traces from the diode array detector,
and sums of the peak areas of all identified NCCs at 320 nm and YCCs
at 420 nm were calculated, corrected for the differences in the weight
of the extracted leaf material, and expressed as the ratio between
the green and yellow leaves.

        Phyllobilin Determination in Thrips-Infested
Basil Leaves
        An infested basil plant was bought at a local
supermarket, and
the identity of the pest as thrips (order Thysanoptera) was determined by microscopy (Institute of Microbiology, University
of Innsbruck). A second, visibly healthy plant was placed next to
the infested one. From the second plant, three leaves were harvested
after 1 month and extracted as described above for the aphid-infested
basil (analytical HPLC system II).

      Results
and Discussion
      Basil (O. basilicum) is known for
the pleasant scent and taste of its intensely green leaves. Since
this flowering plant is a member of the family of the Lamiaceae, our
analysis of the phyllobilins in basil may represent the first investigation
of Chl catabolites generated in a member of this family. Loss of greenness
was seen in commercial basil plants when the whole plants were either
kept inside a room in a semi-shaded area (see Figure 1A) or kept outside at moderate summer temperatures
and in a semi-shaded place. Analysis of the contents of visually senescent
basil leaves by HPLC allowed the detection of four fractions with
the (online) UV/vis characteristics of colorless Chl catabolites (identified
as Ob-NCCs) and one fraction of a (yellow) Ob-YCC, as depicted in Figure 1B. HPLC and online UV/vis of Ob-NCC-40 and YCC (Ob-YCC-45).
      Combined HPLC&#x2013;MS
analysis of an extract of a de-greened
basil leaf (Figures S2 and S3) indicated
the presence of three polar NCCs (Ob-NCC-35, its
tentatively identified, more polar stereoisomer, and Ob-NCC-36) with assigned pseudo-molecular ions at m/z = 747.3, 747.3, and 761.3, respectively, of the
main NCC of intermediate polarity (Ob-NCC-40, m/z = 731.3), of the main YCC (Ob-YCC-45, m/z = 729.3),
and of a less polar minor NCC (Ob-NCC-47, m/z = 645.3). For the purpose of elucidating
the structures of the two most abundant Ob-PBs, Ob-NCC-40 (molecular formula C38H42O11N4 from HRMS: m/z = 731.292; Figures S1 and S3) and Ob-YCC-45 (molecular formula C38H40O11N4, from HRMS: m/z = 729.276; Figure S3), these two Ob-PBs were collected from an extract
of 24.5 g of yellowish-green basil leaves, furnishing samples of 2.9
&#x3BC;mol of Ob-NCC-40 and 0.98 &#x3BC;mol of Ob-YCC-45.
      The structure of Ob-NCC-40
was established as
1-formyl-O33-malonyl-19-oxo-16,19-dihydrophyllobilane by 1H,1H-homonuclear and 1H,13C-heteronuclear NMR spectroscopy at 600 MHz. The NMR data collected
from an aqueous solution (H2O/D2O 9/1) of Ob-NCC-40 at 5 &#xB0;C furnished the signals of all 40 carbon-
and nitrogen-bound H-atoms, as well as of all of its 38 C-atoms. All
signals could be assigned together with a consistent set of internuclear
correlations, based on which the chemical constitution of Ob-NCC-40 could be deduced unambiguously (see Figure 2). In particular, an AB system
at 3.21/3.22 ppm was detected, which gave rise to a cross peak (at
&#x3B4; = 3.21 ppm) with a carbon at &#x3B4; = 44 ppm in a 1H,13C-HSQC spectrum. It was assigned to the methylene
group (H2C35) of a malonyl substituent (for
atom numbering, see SI, Figure S4), as
these methylene protons showed NOE correlations with the methyl groups
H3C21 and H3C71, as well
as 1H,13C-HMBC correlations with their two neighboring
carbonyl groups C34 and C36. Attachment of the
malonyl group at the side chain extending from C3 was secured by a
further 1H,13C-HMBC correlation of the carbonyl-C34 with the methylene group H2C32 of the
PB ethyl side chain at C3. The consistent set of assigned signals
and their through-space or through-bond interactions allowed the unambiguous
delineation of the structure of Ob-NCC-40 as an O33-malonyl-16,19-dihydro-1-formyl-19-oxophyllobilane. The three
polar NCCs (isomer of Ob-NCC-35, Ob-NCC-35 = 15-hydroxy-Ob-NCC-40, and Ob-NCC-36 = 15-methoxy-Ob-NCC-40) with assigned pseudo-molecular
ions at m/z = 747.3, 747.3, and
761.3, respectively, would be tentatively assigned the structures
of the endogenous oxidation products31 of Ob-NCC-40 (15-hydroxy- and 15-methoxy-Ob-NCC-40), the inferred precursors of the PxB Ob-YCC-45.
      A solution of Ob-YCC-45 in DMSO-d6 was analogously subjected to analysis at 500 MHz by 1H,1H-homonuclear and 1H,13C-heteronuclear NMR spectroscopy. The signals of 33 H-atoms (32 carbon
and one nitrogen-bound) as well as of 33 of its 38 C-atoms were detected
and could be assigned. From the available homo- and heteronuclear
correlations, the basic chemical constitution of the YCC could be
deduced as 1-formyl-O33-malonyl-19-oxo-15Z-16,19-dihydrophyllobilene-c (see Figure 3). The C15=C16 double
bond of Ob-YCC-45 was deduced to feature a Z-configuration, on the basis of the strong NOE correlations
of HC15 with H3C131 and H3C171. This assignment was further supported by the characteristically
similar 1H- and 13C-chemical shift data for
C15 and C16 and their neighborhood atoms in the spectra of Ob-YCC-45 and in several YCCs.6,31 Unfortunately,
no clear signals could be assigned to the hypothetical malonyl substituent,
and the site of its attachment could not be delineated. However, based
on the similarity of the chemical shift data for the critical ring
A section of Ob-YCC-45 with those of Ob-NCC-40 (see above) and its UV/vis and HRMS data, the structure of Ob-YCC-45 was deduced as 1-formyl-O33-malonyl-19-oxo-15Z-16,19-dihydrophyllobilene-c, i.e., as
the product of a formal dehydrogenation of Ob-NCC-40
(see Figure 4).

        Figure 4

          Structural
outline of a proposed path of the formation of Ob-NCC-40 and Ob-YCC-45 in basil leaves.
Two alternative sequences for the formation of the O33-malonylated
NCC Ob-NCC-40 are considered. (a) Ob-NCC-40 results from a hypothetical malonylation of 32-OH-pFCC* by a cytosolic enzyme malonyl transferase
(MAL), furnishing the corresponding O33-malonyl-pFCC*, followed by an acid-induced isomerization (ISO) of
O33-malonyl-pFCC* in the vacuole; (b) Ob-NCC-40 is alternatively generated via the acid-induced
isomerization (ISO) of 32-hydroxy-pFCC*
in the vacuole, giving the less polar NCC, Ob-NCC-47,
which undergoes a hypothetical malonylation by a vacuolar enzyme MAL.
An enzyme-catalyzed hydroxylation (OX) of Ob-NCC-40,
followed by elimination of water (EL), furnishes Ob-YCC-45. The designation pFCC* refers to the unknown
configuration at C16 of the &#x201C;primary&#x201D; FCC from basil
leaves.

      O33-malonylated NCCs5,41 and an O33-malonylated YCC29 with further
modifications elsewhere in these molecules have been described earlier.
A purified malonyl transferase (MAL) from oilseed rape (Brassica
napus) was tested successfully in vitro, with several NCCs
carrying a hydroxyl group at C32.42 However, a corresponding set of FCCs carrying a hydroxyl group at
C32, such as 32-OH-pFCC*, the
likely substrate of MAL in basil leaves (see Figure 4), were not available and were not tested
at that time. Hence, the here-discussed malonylation reaction may
probably occur in the cytosol at the stage of the 32-hydroxy-pFCC*. An alternative malonylation of 32-OH-NCC
as substrate was expected to take place in the vacuoles, where precedence
for such an enzyme activity is not available. Indeed, the least polar
of the detected Ob-PBs, Ob-NCC-47,
showed the same characteristic UV/vis spectra and also exhibited the
MS-derived molecular formula (C35H40O8N4) of a 32-hydroxylated NCC, an abundant NCC
in flowering plants, discovered by Curty and Engel43 in senescent leaves of Cercidiphyllum japonicum. Hence, Ob-NCC-47 was tentatively assigned the
structure of 1-formyl-32-hydroxy-19-oxo-16,19-dihydrophyllobilane
(see Figure 4).
      Having identified the products of senescence-associated chlorophyll
breakdown in basil leaves, we investigated their occurrence in basil
plants that showed signs of chlorosis as a consequence of infestation
with herbivores. Insect feeding elicited diverse responses from the
host plant. There were, however, minor differences in the signaling
pattern associated with different pests&#x2014;aphids, for example,
induced responses mediated via the plant hormones jasmonic acid, ethylene,
and salicylic acid, whereas the response to thrips seems to be rather
related to wound signaling through jasmonic acid.44,45 Thrips is a common pest found in greenhouses, but also gardens.
Thrips causes mechanical damage to the plant tissue to suck the plant
saps,44 a procedure that is different from
aphids, whose feeding mechanism is much more precise and relies on
the injection of salivary proteins into the plant.46
      We analyzed the relative contents of Ob-NCCs and Ob-YCCs in aphid and thrips-infested basil
plants, thereby
differentiating between zones on the leaves that were visibly green
and &#x201C;unaffected&#x201D;, and sections that showed symptoms
of the pest infestations.
      For the aphid infestation, aphids
were transferred to a basil plant,
and symptoms of the infestation, such as chlorosis, could be observed
approximately 1 week later. The leaves of the aphid-infested plants
showed de-coloration in small zones around the localizations of the
aphids on the leaf (Figure 5A). When analyzing the extracts of the de-colored
spots and of the surrounding still visibly green tissue, an increased
amount in PBs becomes evident (Figure 5B). Indeed, the statistical analysis of six independent
experiments of the green versus yellow section of six leaves from
three different basil plants showed clearly that YCCs and NCCs occurred
in elevated quantities in yellow sections compared to those in the
surrounding green areas, i.e., 10 times more YCC and 6 times more
NCCs as analyzed by the peak areas of the signals (Figure 6).

        Figure 5

HPLC analyses of sections of a basil leaf infested by aphids. Sections
of different colors were cut out with a scalpel, weighed, extracted,
and subjected to analytical HPLC (analytical HPLC system II). The
signal of Ob-YCC-45 (indicated by arrows) is much
higher in yellow sections compared to that in green areas. The 420
nm trace is shown.

        Figure 6

          Occurrence of PBs in
aphid-infested and green parts of basil leaves.
Significantly higher amounts of PBs are found in the yellow, aphid-infested
parts of a basil leaf compared to the green parts of the same leaf.
Bar graph showing the ratios of the amounts of NCCs or of Ob-YCC-45 in the yellow versus green parts of the infested
basil leaves. About 5 times higher quantities of NCCs and 10 times
higher quantities of the YCC were determined by analytical HPLC. The
mean values of six independent experiments are shown; error bars represent
standard deviations (** p &lt;0.01).

      In comparison to the damage caused by aphids, symptoms of infestation
were observed later for the thrips-infected basil plants, and de-colored
zones were less defined and larger and appeared black-silvery on the
leaf, as is typical for thrips. To investigate the relative amounts
of PBs in the visibly affected areas and surrounding green tissue,
the leaves were collected about 1 month after the infection of the
plant; extracts were prepared of the different sections and analyzed
by HPLC (see Figure S7). Three independent
experiments were performed, and every single experiment showed elevated
levels for each of the analyzed types of PBs and at least more than
2 times higher amount of total PBs compared to the green sections
(Figure 7); however,
a very large variance in the relative abundance was observed. This
could be due to the diffuse nature of the affected zones on the leaves,
which made cutting out defined sections for extraction difficult.

        Figure 7

          Occurrence
of PBs in the thrips-infested and green parts of the
basil leaves. At least twice the amount of PBs are found in parts
of a basil leaf infested by thrips (order Thysanoptera) compared to the green parts of the same leaf. Dot plot showing
the ratios of NCC, YCC, and total PB abundances in the infested versus
green parts of the thrips-infested basil leaves. For three independent
experiments, each measurement showed at least 2.1 times higher quantities
of total PBs in the infested parts versus green parts as determined
by analytical HPLC, with mean values of 4.2 times higher amounts for
the NCC and 9.8 times higher for the YCC. Due to the large variance
of the individual experiments, further statistical analyses were not
performed.

      Basil is known to be highly susceptible
to gray mold caused by Botrytis cinerea, which often invokes the need for
fungicide treatment.47 In a preliminary
test, B. cinerea and two other important
fungal pathogens, Rhizoctonia solani and Fusarium graminearum, were used
to infect the visibly healthy basil plants. Three weeks after the
infection, all plants showed symptoms of chlorosis. Symptomatic leaf
samples were analyzed by HPLC analogous to the aphid and thrips experiments.
Again, compared to an uninfected control plant, the signals of Ob-YCC-45 were much more prominent in all of the infected
plants (see SI). Especially necrotrophic pathogens, such as B. cinerea, R. solani, and F. graminearum, cause wilting
of their host, which is preceded by chlorosis of green plant parts,
and utilize mycotoxins to induce a fast programmed cell death and
hypersensitive response. Similar to insect pests, hormonal pathways
are induced (shikimic acid/jasmonic acid) in plantae. In Arabidopsis thaliana infected with B. cinerea, cotranscriptional networks linked to
chloroplast genes and genes specific for chlorotic leaves were consistently
induced.48 The malonylated PBs Ob-NCC-40 and Ob-YCC-45 appear to be metabolites
that are part of the general, hypersensitive response of O. basilicum to pathogens and pests.
      Whether
increased amounts of PBs are formed as a response to the
herbivore attack to protect the surrounding tissue from oxidative stress or play a completely
different role, such as involvement in signaling for the plant, has
yet to be elucidated. In particular, the O33-malonylation,
revealed by the detailed structural analysis of Ob-NCC-40 and Ob-YCC-45, raises interest in regard
to defense-related mechanism(s), since introducing malonyl groups
to secondary metabolites has been observed as a response to insect
feeding. For example, the tagging of 17-hydroxygeranyl-linalool diterpene
glycosides (DTGs) with malonyl groups was shown to occur upon herbivore
attack in Nicotiana rustica, although
this modification seems not to be relevant for plant defense, since
the malonylated metabolites did not appear to be stable once taken
up by the insects.49 Therefore, a role
in signaling for the plant for malonylated DTGs may be more likely.49
      Our investigations with basil leaves have
revealed the presence
of several phyllobilins from the senescence-associated PAO/PB pathway
of Chl breakdown, which accumulated in green-yellow, in herbivore-infested,
and in fungal-infected leaves, in particular. Four novel PBs were
discovered, three (colorless) NCCs and a (yellow-colored) phylloxanthobilin
(PxB). They displayed a specifically malonylated structure and were
related to each other by modifications delineating their hypothetical
metabolic inter-relation. Recent studies with PxBs,5 e.g., of YCCs from Echinacea purpurea and of a dioxobilin-type analogue (DYCC) from savoy cabbage showed
strong antioxidative activities for these PxBs, exceeding those of
ascorbic acid and trolox, a water-soluble vitamin E derivative.33,35 The locally defined increase of PxBs from the PAO/PB pathway upon
pest infestation could indicate that PxBs play a role as strong antioxidants
in protecting the surrounding tissue from the oxidative stress elicited
by the plant&#x2019;s response to herbivores and fungi. Elevated levels
of PBs appear to be independent of the nature of the plant pest, pointing
toward a yet unexplored plant response on the molecular level. In
this context, the malonylated PBs Ob-NCC-40 and Ob-YCC-45, which were newly identified in the basil leaves
by full spectroscopic characterization, are particularly interesting
since malonylation of secondary metabolites has been described as
a response to insect feeding.49 The pronounced
formation of PBs in the affected areas of the basil leaves also suggests
an involvement of the products of the PAO/PB pathway of Chl breakdown
in plant defense or signaling.
