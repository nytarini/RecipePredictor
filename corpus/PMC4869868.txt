Fast foods are often energy dense and offered in large serving sizes. Observational data has linked the consumption of fast food to an increased risk of obesity and related diseases.

Design
We surveyed the reported energy, total fat and saturated fat contents, and serving sizes, of fast food items from five major chains across 10 countries, comparing product categories as well as specific food items available in most countries.

Setting
MRC Human Nutrition Research (HNR), Cambridge

Subjects
Data for 2961 food and drink products were collected, with most from Canada (n=550) and fewest from United Arab Emirates (n=106).

Results
There was considerable variability in energy and fat content of fast food across countries, reflecting both the portfolio of products, and serving size variability. Differences in total energy between countries were particularly noted for chicken dishes (649-1197kJ/100g) and sandwiches (552-1050kJ/100g). When comparing the same product between countries variations were consistently observed in total energy and fat content (g/100g) with extreme variation in McDonald’s Chicken McNuggets with 12g total fat (g/100g) in Germany compared to 21.1g in New Zealand.

Conclusions
These cross-country variations highlight the possibility for further product reformulation in many countries to reduce nutrients of concern and improve the nutritional profiles of fast food products around the world. Standardisation of serving sizes towards the lower end of the range would also help to reduce the risk of overconsumption.

   Introduction
‘Fast food’ epitomises the change in food culture in Western countries over the last 60 years. More recently many of the most well-known quick service chains have established themselves elsewhere, particularly in the Middle-East and Asia-Pacific countries (1, 2).

These outlets have evolved to meet the needs of time-poor consumers, offering standardised food and/or drink items that can be served quickly, from pre-prepared or processed ingredients, with outlets sited to be readily accessible to large numbers of consumers (3–6). However the ecological associations between fast food outlets and the prevalence of obesity have raised health concerns. In the UK the density of fast food outlets is greatest in areas of deprivation which also have a higher prevalence of childhood obesity (7, 8) and in the USA there is a demonstrated correlation between proximity to fast food outlets and obesity (9, 10). A review of the effects of fast food in rural China has also shown a positive correlation between measures of obesity and the number of fast food outlets (11). Other studies have related fast food intake to weight gain and insulin resistance (12–16), associations attributed to the energy density, high levels of fat, saturated fat, added sugar and salt in many fast food items (17). Fast foods are often also offered in large serving sizes and up-selling is common both though promotions and at the point of sale (18).

Although usually purporting to be standardised products, there are reports of significant differences in the nutritional content of apparently identical fast food items provided by the same vendor. In 2005-06, a comparison of the fat content of French fries and fried chicken from 35 countries showed a range of 41 to 65g/serving at McDonald’s and 42 to 74g/serving at Kentucky Fried Chicken (KFC) (19). More recently a survey showed the variability in the nutrient content of fast food from leading chain restaurants in Australia (20) and marked variation in salt content per 100g of the same product in different countries (21). Moreover, there can be considerable variation in serving size that impacts on the absolute nutrient content per serving. For example, serving sizes are reported to be greater in the USA than for comparable outlets in Europe (22).

In 2010 the Global Food Monitoring Group was established with the aim of collating and sharing product data between collaborating countries, enabling tracking of changes in product nutritional composition worldwide, including both retail sales and out of home purchases (23). Given the popularity of fast food products we have explored the reported nutrient contents of comparable food items from popular transnational chains, to determine the extent of cross-country variation in energy (kJ), total fat (g) and saturated fat (g) content and to help guide the identification of better product formulation.

Methods
A survey of the reported energy (kJ), total fat (g), and saturated fat (g) content per serving and per 100g in food and drink items was undertaken across ten countries; Canada, United States of America (USA), Netherlands, United Kingdom (UK), Germany, United Arab Emirates (UAE), Australia, New Zealand, China, and Japan with data collected for products where the descriptors implied they were broadly comparable by ingredients or product type. Data were collected between January and March 2012 from company websites. Serving size and total fat data for McDonald’s Japan products were collected in November 2012 as this information was not previously available online and provided that the nutrient data online matched the information previously collected. A full outline of the data collection protocol for fast foods has been published previously (23).

Data collection
A fast food chain was defined as an outlet that sells food products that are ready-to-eat, sold in servings and not arriving in the outlet in their final package (23). Data were obtained for all available food and drink products from fast food chain websites specific to each country, using publically available product information, and entered into a data collection spread sheet. Data for each food and drink item were collected by country, recording chain name, product title, and serving size (g and ml for drinks). The nutritional content recorded for each product was energy (kJ/serving and kJ/100g), total fat (g/serving and g/100g), and saturated fat (g/serving and g/100g). In instances where data were not provided per 100g of product this was calculated based on the reported serving size weight. Companies that provided energy only as kcal was converted to kJ using the conversion factor 4.184kJ/kcal.

An attempt was made to collect information for all food and drink items displayed on chain websites, resulting in data for 2961 products. Where nutritional data or serving size information was not provided on the website, or if there was a technical fault with the website at the time of data collection, the relevant information was requested via email to customer services or the company nutritionist if known. A total of 20 emails were sent with three responses received in total. Data collected was subject to quality checks with a random sample of 10% of all products double checked by a nutritionist for legitimacy and errors in transcription from the original data source. The Google Translate tool was used to assist in language translation where web pages were not provided in English.

Product categories
Food items were grouped into eight categories: breakfast items, burgers, chicken products, pizza, sides, salads, sandwiches and milkshake type beverages (Table 1). These product categories are consistent with previous published reports in this area (20, 21). Any products that were family share combinations marketed to serve more than one person, or combinations of products falling into multiple categories, such as meal deals, were excluded from this analysis.

Data analysis
The median nutrient content (kJ or g/serving and 100g), for each food category and country were examined. Products were reviewed by title to ensure cross-country comparison of the same product. Of the 2961 products collected, ten food and drink products symbolising the brand as their signature product, or assumed by the authors as one of the most popular menu items, were directly compared at an individual level. Data were checked for distribution and medians and ranges calculated using SPSS version 21. Due to the nature of these data, statistical analysis was not appropriate; therefore descriptive data is presented only.

Results
Data on the reported energy (kJ), total fat (g) and saturated fat (g) contents of fast food products (n=2961) were collected across ten countries for five fast food chains: Burger King (Hungry Jack’s in Australia and New Zealand), Kentucky Fried Chicken (KFC), McDonald’s, Pizza Hut and Subway. The fewest number of products were collected for the UAE (n = 106), with the greatest number from Canada (n=550, Table 2). Pizza had the most products by category (n=753) whereas beverages had the fewest products (n=194).

Serving size comparisons by country
Across countries there was marked variation in the median serving size within product categories, with the lowest variation in breakfast items and the highest in salads (Table 3). Japan had the lowest serving sizes for four product categories - burger, pizza, salad and sandwiches. Two countries had the highest median serving sizes for two product categories each– UAE for beverages and burgers and the UK for sandwiches and sides. Small variations were observed in serving sizes of breakfast items, burgers, pizza, sandwiches and sides across the ten countries with the maximum within category difference in median serving size being 88g or less. However, beverages and salads showed particularly large variability. Beverages ranged from the lowest median serving size of 281ml in Germany to more than 50% greater in the UAE which has the highest median serving size of 434ml. Salads ranged from the smallest median serving at 172g in Japan to more than twice this size in Australia where the median serving was 364g. Likewise the median serving size for chicken in Germany was more than double that in the US (180g and 83g respectively).

Energy, total fat and saturated fat content by country
The salad category displayed the lowest variation in energy, total fat and saturated fat content across countries and chicken the highest (Figures 1, 2 and 3). Chicken in the Netherlands offered the lowest energy density (649kJ/100g) as compared to the USA which offered the highest (1196kJ/100g). Sides showed less variation with Japan offering the lowest energy density (914kJ/100g) and Germany offering the highest (1238kJ/100g).

The lowest median total fat/100g (/100ml for beverages) was observed in two categories each in Japan (beverages and sides), New Zealand (burgers and salads) and the UK (chicken and pizza); however the highest median total fat/100g (/100ml for beverages) was observed in three categories each in Japan (breakfast, burgers and salads) and the US (beverages, chicken and pizza) (Figure 2). Large variations were observed in the total fat/100g for all countries especially in the breakfast and sandwiches category. Breakfast items available in Japan offered the highest total fat (17.7g) as compared to the UAE which offered the lowest levels of total fat (8.6g). Sandwiches in China contained the lowest median total and saturated fat/100g (2.2g and 0.8g) as compared to the UAE (11.3g and 4.4g) reflecting differences in the menu items available.

New Zealand had the lowest saturated fat/100g (/100ml for beverages) in five product categories – beverages, burgers, chicken, salads and sides - whereas the UAE had the highest in three product categories (chicken, sandwiches and sides).

Energy, total fat and saturated fat content per serving
The median energy content per serving varied within all product categories with differences from 364kJ/serving in sandwiches to 1581kJ/serving in beverages (supplementary tables). Chicken products in the USA and Germany had comparable median energy kJ/100g (1197kJ/100g and 1054kJ/100g respectively) but the median serving size in Germany was more than double that in the US (180g and 83g respectively). Consequently chicken in the USA demonstrated the lowest median energy content per serving (1025kJ), and Germany the highest (2096 kJ). Median energy per serving for sandwiches and sides from the UK were the highest amongst all countries, 1741kJ and 1582kJ respectively, which is in line with the UK recording the largest mean serving sizes for these product categories (242g and 167g).

A similar pattern was observed for total fat and saturated fat. Breakfast items available in China offered the highest median total fat (24.0g) and saturated fat (10.0g) contents (supplementary tables) as compared to the UAE which offered the lowest total fat at 50% less than that of China (12.0g). Canada had the lowest median saturated fat content (5.0g) for breakfast items. The total fat and saturated fat content of beverages was greatest in Chinese products (18.5g and 13.5g), closely followed by the USA (18.0g and 12.0g) and more than 50% higher than UK products (9.0g and 6.0g respectively). The UK had highest total fat content for sides (19.0g), which is 2.8g/serving more than the next ranked country (UAE) and 8.5g/serving more than the lowest ranked country (USA). Despite this the UAE had the highest saturated fat g/serving for sides (7.1g) which was 2.1g per serving higher than the UK.

Specific product comparisons by country
In order to control for differences in available menu items, we reviewed the reported total energy and fat content of nine individual products across five chains, which were comparable by product name and description in all selected countries (Table 4). Total energy and fat content per 100g varied for each product between countries. Burger King’s Whopper Burger showed the least variation (967-1029kJ, 12.6-14.5g) and KFC Original Recipe Chicken the most (536-1301kJ, 7.5-18.2g). McDonald’s Chicken McNuggets showed extreme variation with 12g total fat per 100g in Germany as compared to 21.1g in New Zealand. Although KFC Original Recipe Chicken showed high variation in energy content (536-1301kJ), only some countries stated the type of chicken piece which could explain some of the variation. The McDonald’s Garden Side Salad in UAE was reported to contain 6.2g total fat (g/100g) whereas all countries except Canada (1.3g fat/100g) have a negligible value.

Discussion
Our investigation of fast food products demonstrates the wide variation in the serving size of similar products across different countries, and reveals compositional differences in energy, total fat and saturated fat at both the category and individual product level. In some cases nutritional composition and serving size are additive, such that the energy and fat differences were greater when reviewed per serving rather than per 100g. Our results support and extend previous findings to provide a more comprehensive analysis of the nutrient content of fast food (21).

The disparity in energy, total fat and saturated fat content within the same food category and particularly within the same individual product available in different countries clearly indicates that it is technically feasible for manufacturers to improve the nutritional quality of fast food products. Manufacturers have a responsibility to act, or should expect to be challenged by public health groups, on the disparity in products between countries. While there may be issues of consumer expectations about the taste of a product the experience of reformulation in some countries has shown it is possible to make large reductions in levels of sodium, sugar and fat over time if done in small steps (24). Serving dressing or sauces as an option as opposed to a standard offer, and increased amounts of fruit and vegetables where possible, may be more feasible for manufacturers in some countries than product reformulation to reduce the levels of fat, sugar and energy. Similarly standardising serving sizes towards the lower end of the international range will help to reduce consumption of energy, fat and saturated fat from fast foods as the greatest variations in our study were observed when comparisons were made per serving.

It is notable that there is substantial variation within a single food category, for example, chicken or salads. In the case of larger serving sizes of a comparable product, the higher energy content may be evident to consumers but in categories such as salads with greater diversity it may be less clear. This highlights the importance of clear food labelling so consumers can make a more informed choice at the point of purchase.

Our review has some limitations, primarily relating to data collection and availability. The presented data do not purport to represent the entire fast food market. However it provides a useful snapshot of the international variations in nutrient composition and serving size of foods often considered to be a standardised product. We have captured data as available on company websites and available to consumers and have assumed these data are accurate, however we do note data were collected in 2012 and products may have been modified since. Product data collected reflects online availability at that time and as such may contain some seasonal items; data for McDonald’s Japan included some Christmas varieties. Efforts were made to standardise data availability through the three month collection period between January and March, when there are generally fewer seasonal items on menus. As often the situation with data collection exercises we could not have foreseen where data for nutrient content or serving size would be missing between brands and countries. Pizza Hut data were difficult to obtain in more than half our selected countries and data per 100g or serving sizes were not available for all chains in China. Data on saturated fat content were not available for any Japanese chain showing that chains opt to provide different information in different countries. Fast food and restaurant nutrition labelling has been exempt from food labelling laws until recently and is now starting to emerge as part of the legislation which might explain some of the differences in the data availability between the countries. Product availability is shown in our data with the number of products reviewed varying substantially between long-standing fast food markets of USA, Canada and the UK, compared to emerging markets in the Middle East countries and China. Where we have presented data for serving size, these are solely recommendations provided by manufacturers and although many items are single piece (such as burgers) there are some recommended for multiple servings that may be consumed as an individual serving. Additionally the data presented relates to the range of products on offer and does not reflect the pattern of purchasing of items which may differ between countries.

The food environment is an important determinant of the choices made by individuals (25, 26). Given the continuing global rise in levels of obesity and its related diseases there is a pressing need for global companies to consider the nutritional composition and serving sizes of the products they offer. Ensuring that the nutritional content in every country reflects the best that is possible anywhere in the world is an important step. It is hoped that responsible companies will want to ensure that progress made in some countries to reformulate should be matched worldwide and this analysis will support the advocacy efforts of civil society to improve public health in countries where progress is slow. It also provides a baseline to assess secular trends in these products within each country over time.
