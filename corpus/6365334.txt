        The effect of adjunct culture Monascus purpureus BD-M-4 on the physicochemical, proteolytic, and lipolytic properties of surface mold-ripened cheese were evaluated. During the maturation of Monascus-fermented cheese, the total microbiota count and the content of soluble nitrogen increased steadily, whereas the total protein content showed no significant difference. Moreover, a 17-fold increase in total free amino acids was observed in Monascus-fermented cheese. The use of adjunct culture M. purpureus BD-M-4 in the production of surface-ripened cheeses did not show a significant effect on the total fat content in the ripening period, nor did it change the lipolysis of cheese during ripening. Compared to 52 volatile compounds of the control cheese, a total of 62 compounds were detected in M. purpureus-fermented cheese, including 16 acids, 16 ketones, 11 alcohols, 5 aldehydes, 11 esters, and 3 unclassified compounds.
