Dysregulated mitochondrial metabolism during hepatic insulin resistance may contribute to pathophysiologies ranging from elevated glucose production to hepatocellular oxidative stress and inflammation. Since obesity impairs insulin action but paradoxically activates mTORC1, we tested whether insulin action and mTORC1 contribute to altered in vivo hepatic mitochondrial metabolism. Loss of hepatic insulin action for 2-weeks caused increased gluconeogenesis, mitochondrial anaplerosis, TCA cycle oxidation and ketogenesis. However activation of mTORC1, induced by loss of hepatic Tsc1, suppressed these fluxes. Only glycogen synthesis was impaired by both loss of insulin receptor and mTORC1 activation. Mice with a double knockout of the insulin receptor and Tsc1 had larger livers, hyperglycemia, severely impaired glycogen storage and suppressed ketogenesis compared to loss of the liver insulin receptor alone. Thus, activation of hepatic mTORC1 opposes the catabolic effects of impaired insulin action under some nutritional states.

   Introduction
Hepatic insulin resistance is a key factor in many pathophysiologies of obesity, including diabetes and nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD). Defects in hepatic insulin signaling contribute to poor glycemia by causing inadequate phosphorylation of Foxo transcription factors that regulate gluconeogenesis, and by ineffectively modulating the phosphorylation of glycogen synthase and glycogen phosphorylase (Lin and Accili, 2011). Metabolic pathways that promote liver damage are also initiated by loss of the insulin signaling, perhaps through effects on oxidative metabolism (Haas et al., 2012) and oxidative damage (Michael et al., 2000). Activation of oxidative metabolism in the liver of obese humans (Iozzo et al., 2010; Sunny et al., 2011) suggests a similar mechanism in NAFLD subjects. Inasmuch as inhibiting pathways associated with the TCA cycle protects against hepatic oxidative stress and inflammation in mice (Satapati et al., 2015), oxidative metabolism appears to play a critical role in the progression of NAFLD.

Chronic exposure to obesity eventually causes defects in hepatic mitochondrial function (Mantena et al., 2009; Rector et al., 2010; Thyfault et al., 2009), but some aspects of mitochondrial metabolism may be altered prior to damage in response to disruptions in insulin signaling. For example, despite insulin resistance, insulin signaling over-activates hepatic lipogenesis (Shimomura et al., 2000), a pathway normally antithetic to fat oxidation. This “selective insulin resistance” occurs with the paradoxical activation of signaling proteins downstream of the insulin receptor. Specifically, mTORC1, a serine-threonine protein kinase with broad roles in cell growth, replication, survival, aging and metabolism (Howell et al., 2013; Zoncu et al., 2011), lies downstream of the insulin receptor and is required for elevated lipogenesis during insulin resistance (Li et al., 2010). Importantly, mTORC1 target proteins may also act to suppress the expression of gluconeogenic (Lustig et al., 2011) and ketogenic genes in liver (Sengupta et al., 2010). A key challenge for understanding the molecular metabolism of insulin resistance is to determine how downstream signaling nodes, like mTORC1, function to regulate metabolic flux, particularly in mitochondria.

To test the hypothesis that hepatic mitochondrial metabolism is altered by signaling components of insulin resistance, we studied loss of insulin action and activation of mTORC1. Stable isotope tracers were used to evaluate in vivo metabolic flux in chow and 8 week HFD mice after an acute (2-week) loss of the insulin receptor and/or constitutive activation of mTORC1 by loss of Tsc1 (Kwiatkowski et al., 2002). We report that loss of insulin action stimulated hepatic TCA cycle metabolism and fat oxidation, similar to our previous findings in fasted mice after 16 weeks of a HFD (Satapati et al., 2012). In contrast, a shorter (8 week) HFD suppressed TCA cycle metabolism in fed mice, resulting in a blunted fed to fasted increment in the flux. This effect was recapitulated by mTORC1 activation. Glycogen metabolism was impaired by both loss of insulin receptor and activation of mTORC1. Activation of mTORC1 in insulin receptor KO liver further provoked hyperglycemia, worsened glycogen storage and suppressed fasting ketosis. Hence, loss of insulin action excited mitochondrial metabolism, but mTORC1 activation suppressed mitochondrial metabolism, and together they caused hyperglycemia with impaired hepatic fat oxidation, a combination observed in severe diabetic models.

RESULTS
Short term liver specific Tsc1 and Insrβ deletion have opposite effects on hepatic gluconeogenesis in mice
To study the heterogeneous metabolic effects of loss of insulin action and constitutive mTORC1 activation, we examined mice with conditional loss of hepatic Insrβ or Tsc1 for glucose homeostasis (Figure 1). Liver specific removal was mediated by Ad-Cre recombination of floxed alleles in adult Tsc1F/F (TscLKO) and InsrβF/F (InsrLKO) two weeks prior to experiments to minimize adaptive effects due to long term hepatic inactivation of Tsc1 (Kwiatkowski et al., 2002) or Insrβ(Michael et al., 2000). Ad-Cre treatment led to ~90% Tsc1 and Insrβ knockdown (Figure 1A and B). To account for the effect of Cre recombinase expression and adenovirus infection, all control mice were injected with Ad-Cre.

The metabolic effects of Insrβ loss or mTORC1 gain of function were first examined in mice fed a chow diet after a ~4-hour (fed/postabsorptive) or 24-hour fast (fasted). Both genotypes had normal plasma glucose concentrations in the fed and fasted state (Figure 1C and D). However, insulin concentration was significantly increased in the InsrLKO mice (Figure 1E) but not TscLKO mice (Figure 1F). To clarify whether two weeks of inactivation of the insulin receptor or activation of mTORC1 is sufficient to alter glucose homeostasis, we performed tracer studies of endogenous glucose production (EGP). Glucose production was significantly reduced in fasted mice compared to fed mice, but neither loss of hepatic insulin receptor (Figure 1G) nor activation of mTORC1 (Figure 1H) altered EGP. Despite normal rates of glucose production, liver mRNA levels of several enzymes of glucose metabolism were altered. Pck1 expression (cytosolic phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase) was increased and Gck (glucokinase) was decreased in liver of InsrLKO mice (Figure 1I). These genes were expressed at relatively normal or reduced expressions in Tsc1LKO mice on a chow diet (Figure 1J) or a HFD.

Since the insulin signaling pathway partially mediates growth, we examined whether liver size was altered in InsrLKO or Tsc1LKO liver (Figure 2). The liver:body ratio was decreased by 35% after loss of insulin receptor (Figure 2A) but increased by 35% after mTORC1 activation (Figure 2B). The change in liver mass (Supplemental Tables 1 and 2) corresponded to a similar decrease in protein content in InsrLKO liver (Figure 2C) and increased protein content in Tsc1LKO liver (Figure 2D). Thus, although total glucose production was normal in both models (Figure 1E), it was supported by less liver mass in InsrLKO mice and more liver mass in Tsc1LKO mice.

Deuterated water was administered and 2H enrichments were examined in plasma glucose (Supplemental Table 3) to determine the relative sources of hepatic glucose production (Supplemental Table 4). Total gluconeogenesis relative to liver protein was dramatically elevated in the fed and fasted state of InsrLKO mice on a chow diet (Figure 2E). In contrast, mTORC1 activation, due to loss of Tsc1, caused a reduction of gluconeogenesis in chow fed mice (Figure 2F). Since mTORC1 activation is associated with insulin resistance, we fed Tsc1LKO mice a HFD for 8 weeks to test if they are susceptible to elevations in gluconeogenesis, but they were found to be protected (Supplemental Table 1). Given the role of autophagy in supporting gluconeogenesis during fasting, we explored whether fasting autophagy was impaired in Tsc1LKO liver by measuring the liver:body weight ratio during fasting. Liver size decreased by 10% after 16 hours and nearly 50% after 24 hours of fasting in control mice. In contrast, Tsc1LKO liver size did not decrease after 16 hours and decreased only 30% after 24 hours (Figure 2G), similar to a previous report (Sengupta et al., 2010).

Tsc1 and Insrβ deletion impair hepatic glycogen metabolism
Since glycogen metabolism is regulated by insulin signaling, we examined whether loss of insulin action or gain of mTORC1 function altered the ability of the liver to store or utilize glycogen (Figure 3). Glycogen content was reduced in fed InsrLKO liver (Figure 3A) as expected, but was also reduced in Tsc1LKO mice (Figure 3B). In vivo glycogenolysis measured by 2H incorporation into plasma glucose (Supplemental Tables 1-3) was normal in InsrLKO mice (Figure 3C) but was reduced by 50% in Tsc1LKO mice (Figure 3D) on a chow diet relative to liver protein. A HFD for 8 weeks increased the effect in Tsc1LKO mice so that whole body glucose production via glycogenolysis was decreased even despite larger liver mass (Supplemental Table 1). We confirmed reduced glycogen breakdown in HFD Tsc1LKO mice by measuring liver glycogen content over 16 hours of fasting (Figure 3E).

To further examine the mechanism of altered glycogen metabolism, mice were fed a high sucrose diet (HSD) to promote glycogen synthesis, and were studied in the fasted and refed state. The normal rise in plasma glucose following refeeding was exacerbated in InsrLKO (Figure 3F) but not in Tsc1LKO mice (Figure 3G). Both InsrLKO and Tsc1LKO mice had reduced glycogen deposition after refeeding (Figures 3H and I). Western blot analysis indicated that Akt phosphorylation (pAktS473) and mTORC1 activation assessed by S6 phosphorylation (pS6S240/244) were induced by refeeding in control mice (Figure 3J), but deletion of Tsc1 or Insrβ blunted this response. Upon refeeding of InsrLKO mice, Gck (glucokinase) mRNA remained low, while Gys2 (liver isoform of glycogen synthase) mRNA was upregulated in InsrLKO livers (Figure 3K). The effects on gene expression were more modest in Tsc1LKO mice; Gck was low in the fasted state but was not significantly lower in the fed state (Figure 3L). Nevertheless, glucokinase and glycogen synthase protein were low in Tsc1LKO livers (Figure 3J). Glycogen synthase kinase (Gsk3α/β) protein phosphorylation responded normally to refeeding but total protein content was remarkably elevated in Tsc1LKO livers. Consistent with low Gck mRNA expression in InsrLKO glucokinase protein levels were dramatically reduced (Figure 3J), without a change in the level of glucokinase regulatory protein (data not shown). Liver glycogen synthase protein in refed InsrLKO mice remained phosphorylated (inactive) following refeeding (Figure 3J). Gsk3α/β phosphorylation responded normally to refeeding in InsrLKO mice, but in contrast to Tsc1LKO livers total protein was very low, suggesting that glycogen synthase phosphorylation may be instigated by another mechanism(s). Thus, insulin receptor loss-of-function and over activation of mTORC1 reduce hepatic glycogen synthesis through distinct mechanisms. Changes in mRNA, protein and phosphorylation levels in InsrLKO liver are consistent with impaired glycogen synthesis due to inactivation of glycogen synthase and low glucokinase content, but reduced glycogen stores in Tsc1LKO livers may be related to dramatically reduced Gs protein content.

Tsc1 and Insrβ deletion have opposite effects on mitochondrial metabolism
Insulin resistance impinges on oxidative metabolism and mitochondrial function, thus we examined in vivo fluxes through mitochondrial pathways (Figure 4). Ketogenesis occurs predominantly in liver mitochondria by the β-oxidation of fatty acids and is induced by fasting. Plasma ketones were elevated in chow fed InsrLKO mice (Figure 4A) but reduced during fasting in Tsc1LKO mice (Figure 4B). Likewise, when 13C labeled ketones were infused into conscious unrestrained mice, the apparent turnover of acetoacetate and β-hydroxybutyrate were increased in InsrLKO mice (Figure 4C) but decreased in Tsc1LKO mice (Figure 4D). This finding was not dependent on normalization to liver protein (Supplemental Table 1 and 2). To examine in vivo mitochondrial metabolism, 13C tracers of the hepatic TCA cycle were also infused and isotopomer analysis of glucose was performed (Supplemental Tables 5 and 6). Consistent with changes in gluconeogenesis, anaplerosis, or the nonoxidative flux of carbon into the TCA cycle (e.g. pyruvate carboxylation, glutaminolysis etc.) was increased by 50% in fed InsrLKO mice (Figure 4E) and decreased by 35% in fed Tsc1LKO mice on a chow diet (Figure 4F). Oxidative metabolism in the TCA cycle was generally decreased by fasting (Figure 4G and H), consistent with a recent study using similar methodology (Hasenour et al., 2015). InsrLKO mice had an overall increase in hepatic TCA cycle flux but remained responsive to nutritional state (Figure 4G). In contrast, hepatic TCA cycle flux in Tsc1LKO mice was reduced and unresponsive to nutritional state (Figures 4H).

We examined several factors that might contribute to lower oxidative metabolism in the liver of HFD Tsc1LKO mice (Figure 5). Neither decreased NEFA (Figure 5A), nor mitochondrial content, evaluated by homogenate citrate synthase (Cs) activity relative to liver mass were reduced in Tsc1LKO mice (Figure 5B). However, several hepatic genes that regulate fat oxidation, including Pparα, Cpt1 and Hmgcs2 were lower in in Tsc1LKO livers (Figure 5C). Ppara, In contrast, Acacb mRNA was increased ~2-fold, and Mcd mRNA was decreased ~2-fold (Figure 5C). These two enzymes catalyze the synthesis and degradation of malonyl-CoA, an inhibitor of Cpt1 mediated lipid transport into the mitochondria. Total Acc protein, but not phosphorylation tended to be increased (Figure 5D-E) . In addition, when refed mice were treated with rapamycin to inhibit mTORC1, Acc phosphorylation was robustly increased (Figure 5F), confirming that mTORC1 impinges directly or indirectly on Acc. Although malonyl-CoA concentration was not increased (Figure 5G), malonylcarnitine ( C3DC/C5OH, includes 3-Hydroxy-isovalerylcarnitine) was significantly, though modestly elevated in the liver of fasted Tsc1LKO mice (Figure 5H). To directly test if β-oxidation is impaired, Tsc1LKO liver homogenates from fasted HFD animals exposed to [1-14C]palmitate had a clear reduction in 14C-metabolites (Figure 5I), consistent with reduced in vivo ketogenesis (Figure 4D), and an overall reduction in β-oxidation. Thus, mTORC1 activation appears to suppress fat oxidation in vitro and in vivo by reducing the expression of oxidative genes and possibly by inhibiting Acc phosphorylation.

Simultaneous loss of insulin action and activation of mTORC1 recapitulate some metabolic features of insulin resistance
Moderate duration (6-8 weeks) HFD models have relatively few overt metabolic disturbances, but eventually develop hyperglycemia, defects in glycogen metabolism, impaired β-oxidation and ketogenesis with more severe obesity and insulin resistance. Since continued activation of mTORC1 during insulin resistance may play role in altered hepatic metabolism (Li et al., 2010), we examined InsrLKO,Tsc1LKO (Insr/Tsc1DLKO ) mice on a HFD for 8 weeks to determine whether stimulation of mTORC1 in the setting of impaired insulin action recapitulates severe diet induced insulin resistance (Figure 6). Insr/Tsc1DLKO mice had similar body weights as InsrLKO/Tsc1+/+ and Insr+/+/Tsc1LKO mice. Loss of Tsc1 at least partially rescued the smaller liver size associated with loss of Insrβ (Figure 6A), indicating that activation of mTORC1 is sufficient to stimulate growth. Insulin levels were not reduced in Insr/Tsc1DLKO mice compared to InsrLKO/Tsc1+/+ mice (Figure 6B). Liver triglyceride concentration was reduced in Insr+/+/Tsc1LKO as previously reported (Kenerson et al., 2015) and was also reduced in Insr/Tsc1DLKO mice compared to InsrLKO/Tsc1+/+, indicating that the reduction in liver triglycerides was independent of insulin action (Figure 6C). To evaluate hepatic fat oxidation we examined fasting plasma ketone concentration. In agreement with reduced ketogenesis caused by activation of mTORC1 (Supplemental Table 1), Insr+/+/Tsc1LKO mice had low ketone concentration, and was sufficient to suppress ketone concentration even in the absence of the insulin receptor (Figure 6D). In contrast to the effects on ketogenesis, fed glucose in Insr/Tsc1DLKO mice was elevated compared to InsrLKO/Tsc1+/+(Figure 6E). Although gluconeogenesis was not measured in Insr/Tsc1DLKO mice, absolute endogenous gluconeogenesis (not normalized to liver protein) was not elevated in fasted or fed Tsc1LKO or InsrLKO mice (Supplemental Table 1 and 2). In contrast, liver glycogen storage in fed mice was impaired in InsrLKO/Tsc1+/+ mice and further impaired in Insr/Tsc1DLKO mice (Figure 6F). This data is consistent with distinct mechanisms of impaired glycogen metabolism caused by loss of insulin action and gain of mTORC1 function, and suggests that impaired glycogen storage is involved in the aggravation of hyperglycemia in the Insr/Tsc1DLKO mice.

A HFD for 8 weeks activates mTORC1 and suppresses TCA cycle flux in liver of fed mice
We previously reported that 16 weeks but not 8 weeks of a HFD caused elevated fasting hepatic TCA cycle flux (Satapati et al., 2012), partially due to elevated anaplerosis and gluconeogenesis (Satapati et al., 2015). Since mTORC1 is nutritionally regulated, we examined whether its role in meditating dysregulated metabolism during a HFD is dependent on nutritional state (Figure 7). A HFD for 16 weeks was sufficient to cause increased mTORC1 activity as indicated by elevated pS6/S6, particularly in the fed state (Figure 7A). As in our previous study (Satapati et al., 2012), 8 weeks of a HFD had no effect on oxidative fluxes in fasted mice. However, flux through the TCA cycle was significantly diminished in the fed state of mice on a HFD (Figure 7B). Activation of mTORC1 in chow Tsc1LKO mice caused a similar reduction of TCA cycle flux, which was not further decreased by a HFD (Figure 7B). In contrast, 8-weeks of HFD had no effect on ketogenesis in control mice (Figure 7C), similar to our previously report (Sunny et al., 2010), but caused a reduction in ketogenesis when mTORC1 was constitutively active (Figure 7C). Thus, 8 weeks of a HFD or activation of mTORC1 similarly suppressed TCA cycle oxidative flux in the fed mice and together potentiated impaired β-oxidation in the fasted state.

Discussion
The complex signaling network of mTor kinase integrates a plethora of positive and negative regulatory events for cell growth, replication, survival, aging and metabolism (Laplante and Sabatini, 2013). mTORC1 is an important down-stream node of the insulin signaling pathway, and hence is expected to govern certain features of insulin action. These features are presumed to be dominated by anabolic pathways like growth, protein synthesis and lipid synthesis. However, mTORC1 also participates in the pathophysiology of insulin resistance. Hepatic mTORC1 is over-activated in obese rodents (Figure 7A and (Khamzina et al., 2005)), and may induce a negative feedback loop from S6K1 to IRS1 (Harrington et al., 2004) and worsen insulin signaling. Constitutive activation of mTORC1 during hyperinsulinemia may also mediate the paradoxical activation of lipid synthesis through downstream targets that activate Srebp (Li et al., 2010). However, long-term mTor inhibition with rapamycin also induces a metabolic syndrome, including insulin resistance, glucose intolerance and dyslipidemia (Laplante and Sabatini, 2012). In mice, 2 weeks of rapamycin treatment decreases expression of insulin signaling proteins in muscle (Blattler et al., 2012) and inhibits assembly of both mTORC1 and mTorc2 in various tissues, with the latter playing an important role in hyperinsulinemia, systemic insulin resistance and glucose intolerance (Lamming et al., 2012). Nevertheless, very long (20 weeks) rapamycin treatment (Fang et al., 2013) or genetic inactivation of mTORC1 activity improves insulin sensitivity and hyperglycemia in mice (Volkers et al., 2014). Thus, while well studied, the interaction of mTORC1 with the metabolic actions of insulin is complex, varies between acute and chronic action and is overall still poorly understood.

Although a HFD impairs hepatic insulin action, it also activates mTORC1, yet conditional loss of insulin signaling or activation of mTORC1 had opposite effects on liver metabolism. mTORC1 activation by hepatic Tsc1 ablation for up to 8 weeks does not increase plasma glucose concentration in mice (Kenerson et al., 2011; Sengupta et al., 2010). Tsc1LKO animals repressed G6pase normally and Pck1 partially in response to refeeding, and had reduced fasting gluconeogenic flux on a HFD, but not chow diet. Loss of the insulin receptor for two weeks caused the failed repression of hepatic G6pase and Pck1 and very low Gck upon refeeding, an effect that is similar to fed LIRKO mice (Michael et al., 2000), but endogenous glucose production was not increased. Thus, InsrLKO mice exhibited a phenotype similar to young LIRKO animals, which were reported to have hyperinsulinemia but normoglycemia for up to 4 weeks of age (Okada et al., 2007).

Activation of mTORC1 can suppress gluconeogenesis via at least 2 potential mechanisms. Phosphorylation and activation of S6k by mTORC1 induces the phosphorylation of Pgc1 at sites that render it unable to activate gluconeogenic genes via HNF4α but preserve its ability to maintain mitochondrial biogenesis (Lustig et al., 2011). Indeed, gluconeogenic genes were reduced in Tsc1LKO liver. In addition, reduced gluconeogenesis in newborn mice with activation of mTORC1 was previously attributed to inhibition of autophagy and restricted supply of amino acids for gluconeogenesis (Efeyan et al., 2013). Amino acid levels trended lower in 24-hour fasted Tsc1LKO animals on a HFD (data not shown) and loss of liver mass during fasting was substantially delayed. In agreement with the established role of insulin action and mTORC1 in tissue growth, Tsc1LKO mice had increased total liver protein, while InsrLKO mice had decreased total liver protein. Liver mass was also an important factor influencing metabolic flux in a practical sense. Total absolute flux (μmol·min−1 ) was only modestly altered in some instances in either Tsc1LKO or InsrLKO mice. However, since liver mass was markedly increased by mTORC1 activation and decreased by insulin receptor loss, striking effects were observed in functional hepatocellular fluxes (μmol·min−1 ·g liver protein−1 ).

Despite having opposite effects on gluconeogenesis, both loss of the insulin receptor and activation of mTORC1 reduced rates of glycogenolysis and glycogen synthesis. The role of insulin action on hepatic glycogenolysis is expected (Buettner et al., 2005), but, the role of mTORC1 in hepatic glycogen metabolism is less appreciated. However, several mechanisms link mTORC1 activation to impaired glycogen metabolism. First, blunted Akt phosphorylation may contribute to low hepatic glycogen in both Tsc1LKO and InsrLKO mice via Gsk3 dependent and independent mechanisms (Wan et al., 2013). Indeed, this appears to be the case in InsrLKO mice which had low total and phosphorylated Gsk3 and failed to dephosphorylate glycogen synthase (Gs) after refeeding. However, this mechanism appears less important in Tsc1LKO mice which maintained Gsk3 regulation. Secondly, mTORC1 was recently reported to activate glycogen synthesis through Srebp mediated regulation of protein targeting glycogen (PTG) (Lu et al., 2014). Indeed, mTORC1 activation paradoxically reduced Srebp-1c by more than 2-fold (data not shown). Finally, the most prominent defect related to glycogen in Tsc1LKO mice was not Gs phosphorylation, but rather a substantial reduction in Gs protein content. Indeed, glycogen metabolism is additive in the Insrβ/Tsc1 DLKO, consistent with independent mechanisms by which Tsc1LKO and InsrLKO perturb glycogen metabolism.

Like hepatic glucose metabolism, hepatic mitochondrial metabolism is also nutritionally responsive and partially regulated through insulin signaling mechanisms. Fasting caused a suppression of TCA cycle flux, similar to a recent study (Hasenour et al., 2015). We tested whether loss of insulin action and/or constitutive activation of mTORC1 are individually sufficient to modulate mitochondrial oxidative metabolism. The loss of insulin receptor increased in vivo hepatic oxidative metabolism, evident as elevated oxidative TCA cycle flux in fed mice and elevated ketogenesis in fasted mice. The activation of mTORC1 had a strikingly opposite effect, by suppressing TCA cycle oxidative flux in the fed state and ketogenic flux in the fasted state. The suppression hepatic ketogenesis by activation of mTORC1 is thought to involve repression of Pparα through the activation nuclear receptor co-repressor 1 and downregulation of Hmgcs2 (Sengupta et al., 2010), a critical enzyme in ketogenesis. Indeed, we found that mTORC1 activation induced Pparα oxidative target genes, including Hmgcs2. In addition, Acc2 mRNA and protein content were increased but Mcd was reduced, which may induce malonyl-CoA levels in the vicinity of mitochondria and suppress Cpt1 mediated fat transport into mitochondria (McGarry, 2002). It is interesting that fasting reduces TCA cycle flux but loss of insulin action (a fasting like state) increases, and mTORC1 activation (a fed like state) suppresses TCA cycle flux. Perhaps it is most notable that constitutive activation of mTORC1 ablated the nutritional responsiveness of hepatic energy metabolism as observed by the blunted TCA cycle flux in fed mice and no further reduction by fasting. On the other hand, the loss of the insulin receptor elevated oxidative fluxes regardless of nutritional state, but the decrement due to fasting was retained. Thus, mTORC1 deactivation, but not necessarily insulin action per se, is required for nutritional flexibility of oxidative metabolism in liver.

Since insulin resistance activates mTORC1, a HFD should recapitulate aspects of the Tsc1LKO and InsrLKO mice. Observations in humans and animal models indicate a spectrum of changes in hepatic mitochondrial metabolism during insulin resistance. Mild insulin resistance may have no effect, while moderate insulin resistance induces hepatic oxidative metabolism,, and more severe insulin resistance is associated with defects in β-oxidation and respiration (Cheng et al., 2009; Koliaki et al., 2015; Rector et al., 2010; Satapati et al., 2008; Satapati et al., 2012; Sunny et al., 2011). However, an important finding reported here is that the nutritional state of the subject may be as important as the degree of obesity/insulin resistance, when it comes to understanding the effect on mitochondrial metabolism. For example, a HFD for 16 weeks caused increased oxidative flux in liver of fasted mice, but 8 weeks seemed to have no effect (Satapati et al., 2012). This increase could be explained by elevated anaplerosis and gluconeogenic energy demand (Satapati et al., 2015), and since 8 weeks of a HFD was not sufficient to alter these fluxes in the fasted state, an effect on mitochondrial metabolism was not observed. However, even short durations of HFD are sufficient to cause hepatic insulin resistance, so effects on mitochondrial metabolism might be best observed in mice that are not fasted; when insulin resistance is most prominent. Indeed, the increment between fed and fasted state was essentially abolished after 8 weeks of a HFD. Thus, in fed mice, our results are similar to Thyfault and colleagues who found impaired hepatic oxidative capacity in rat models susceptible to hepatic steatosis (Thyfault et al., 2009). Hence, it appears that a HFD in mice induces oxidative metabolism in the fasted state but suppresses it in the immediate post absorptive state, and perhaps overall reduces the nutritional flexibility of the pathway.

This “flexibility” in oxidative metabolism may be governed in part by mTORC1 activation. Activation of mTORC1 for 2-weeks closely resembles the effect of 8 weeks of a HFD, by suppressing oxidative TCA cycle in fed mice, and resembles more severely insulin resistant models by suppressing fasting ketogenesis. Thus, reduced oxidative mitochondrial function could precede frank insulin resistance, as previously described (Rector et al., 2010), through mTORC1 or other discrete signaling pathways activated by obesity. Severely insulin resistant models, such as leptin receptor deficient rats have a strong induction of mTor signaling (Zheng et al., 2009) and reduced hepatic fat oxidation secondary to impaired ketogenesis (Satapati et al., 2008). A similar but less severe effect is observed after long term (32 weeks) HFD (Satapati et al., 2012). The suppression of ketogenesis by mTORC1 activation may have important implications for fatty liver disease, which was recently demonstrated to progress from steatosis to steatohepatitis when ketogenesis was suppressed by Hmgcs2 loss (Cotter et al., 2014). Thus, it is significant that in the setting of lost insulin action, mTORC1 activation was sufficient to suppress ketogenesis and potentiate hyperglycemia, partially mediated by impaired glycogen storage.

Although we interpret the data to indicate that insulin signaling and mTORC1 activation can partially mediate the hepatic metabolic effects of diet induced obesity, the study has several limitations. The background strains of the LKO mice were not perfectly controlled. InsrLKO mice were purchased backcrossed and C57bl/6J control mice were used as suggested by Jackson Laboratory (Jax.org, 2016). However, subsequent information suggests that the mice are actually C57bl/6N (Jax.org, 2016). Thus comparison between InsrLKO and Tsc1LKO mice could not be made. Since DLKO mice were created by crossing heterozygous mice, those comparisons should be valid, though flux was not measured in that cohort. We also noted that following the Ad-Cre injections 2-weeks prior to studies, mice stopped gaining weight on a HFD, thus the weight of the mice was slightly less than usual for an 8-week HFD, though they were still significantly heavier than chow mice. Comparisons to control mice should be valid since they were also administered Ad-Cre.

Finally, it has been suggested that propionate tracers of TCA cycle metabolism alter flux and yield substantially different values compared to lactate tracers (Perry et al., 2016). However, we recently validated our approach by correlating tracer flux and oxygen consumption in perfused liver, by measuring in vivo glucose production with/without propionate, and by direct comparison of propionate and lactate tracers (Satapati et al., 2015). We (Satapati et al., 2015), nor an independent group (Hasenour et al., 2015), could identify substantial effects of propionate on TCA cycle flux when used at tracer levels and analyzed by an appropriate mathematical model. In fact, lactate tracers have historically report relative fluxes similar to ours (Beylot et al., 1995; Landau et al., 1995), so we are uncertain why another group obtained very different results with lactate and other tracers (Befroy et al., 2014; Perry et al., 2016). For the interested reader, we recommend a recent review (Previs and Kelley, 2015).

In summary, loss of insulin action and constitutive activation of mTORC1 both occur during hepatic insulin resistance. Short-term inactivation of hepatic Tsc1 constitutively activated mTORC1 and opposed many of the metabolic effects observed in InsrLKO mice, with the exception of glycogen metabolism which was suppressed by both. 8 weeks of a HFD caused the suppression of hepatic TCA cycle flux in the fed but not fasted state and this was recapitulated in chow fed Tsc1LKO mice. The loss of insulin action, rather than mTORC1 activation, appears to be more directly related to the upregulation of fluxes of the TCA cycle as observed in fasted mice after 16 weeks of a HFD. Together, insulin resistance and mTORC1 activation may account for a loss in the responsiveness of mitochondrial fluxes to nutritional state during obesity and insulin resistance.

Experimental Procedures
Animals
All animal experiments were approved by IACUC. Insrβflox/flox (Aasum et al., 2003) mice were purchased from Jackson Laboratory and C57BL/6J control mice were used as suggested (Jax.org, 2016). Tsc1flox/flox (Kwiatkowski et al., 2002) mice on a mixed background were backcrossed to C57BL/6J for 3-8 generations and compared to littermate Tsc1+/+ control animals. Double floxed mice were generated first by crossing Insrβflox/flox with Tsc1flox/+ mice from the 3rd generation of backcross, and Insrβflox/+ Tsc1flox/+ offspring were then crossed with Insrβflox/flox mice to obtain Insrβflox/flox Tsc1flox/+ mice. These mice were used as parents for the experimental Insrβflox/flox Tsc1+/+ and Insrβflox/flox Tsc1flox/flox animals.

Male mice were 14-16 weeks old at the time of the sacrifice, maintained on 12 h dark/12 h light cycle with unrestricted access to food and water unless otherwise noted. Animals were fed standard chow (NCD) (Teklad diet 2016, Harlan Laboratories, Indianapolis, IN), high fat diet (HFD) (60% fat calories, Teklad diet TD06414; Harlan Laboratories) for 8 weeks or high sucrose diet (HSD) (10% fat calories, 70% sucrose calories, diet D07042201, Research Diets, New Brunswick, NJ ) for 10 days.

Adenovirus coding for Cre recombinase (Ad-Cre) (Gene Transfer Vector Core, University of Iowa, IA) was expanded in HEK 293T cells and purified using Adeno-X™ Maxi Purification Kit (Clontech, Mountain View, CA). Elution media was exchanged for 0.9% saline using PD10 desalting column (GE Healthcare, Pittsburgh, PA) and 1.3-1.5×109 pfu/animal of virus was injected into the tail vein of control and floxed mice 14 days before sacrifice.

Stable isotope tracer infusions
Infusions were performed as described previously (Satapati et al., 2012). Briefly, on day 4 after surgical implantation of indwelling jugular vein catheters, ad libitum fed or overnight (17 h) fasted were placed in a clean cage. Unrestrained mice were infused with [3,4-13C2]acetoacetate and [U-13C4]sodium b-hydroxybutyrate as a bolus (8.8 and 6.7 μmol/h, respectively) for 10 min followed by 80 min of continuous infusion (3.5 and 2.7 μmol/h, respectively). At the end of the infusion, ~50 μl of blood was collected for LC-MS/MS analysis of ketone turnover (Sunny et al., 2010). Mice then received an intraperitoneal injection of isotonic D2O (99%; 27 μl/ body weight). [U-13C3]propionate and [3,4-13C2] glucose was infused as a bolus (0.15 and 6 μmol/h, respectively) over 10 min, followed by 80 min of continuous infusion (0.03 and 1.2 μmol/h, respectively). After infusions, mice were anesthetized by Isoflurane (Aerrane, Baxter, Deerfield, IL) and blood was collected until exsanguinated by cardiac puncture. Liver was collected and flash-frozen in liquid nitrogen. Samples were stored at −80°C until further analysis. Altogether, “fed” mice were without food for ~4-hours and “fasted” mice were without food for ~21-hours. Fluxes were evaluated as previously described (Satapati et al., 2012) and elaborated upon in the supplemental materials.

Oxidation of palmitate in liver homogenates
In vitro oxidation of palmitate was performed as described by Dohm et al. (Dohm et al., 1972) with few modifications. Briefly, overnight (16 h) fasted animals were anesthetized by Isoflourane and blood was collected by cardiac puncture. Liver was excised and submerged into ice cold reaction buffer (2 mM ATP, 0.05 mM CoA, 1 mM dithiotreitol, 0.1 mM NAD+, 1 mM DL-carnitine, 0.1 mM malate, 1 mM MgCl2, 0.072 mM fatty acid free BSA, 100 mM sucrose, 10 mM K2HPO4, 80 mM KCl, 0.1 mM EDTA, 100 mM HEPES pH 7.3). ~500 mg of liver was homogenized in 2.5 ml of reaction buffer by 11 strokes of hand-operated Potter-Elvehjem homogenizer. Reaction was started by adding 3 μl of [1-14C] palmitate (0.3 μCi, final 25 μM; PerkinElmer, Waltham, MA) to 200 μl of homogenate. Tube was immediately inserted into a vial with silicone septa containing filter paper soaked in hyamine hydroxide to capture 14CO2. Reactions were incubated at 37°C for 4, 5, 6, and 7 min (duplicate for each time point) and terminated by injecting 100 ml of 7% (v/v) HClO4. To ensure complete capture of 14CO2, vials were left at 4°C overnight. Next day, reaction tube was centrifuged at 15,000 × g for 10 min. 200 μl of supernatant as well as filter paper were counted for incorporation of 14C into acid soluble molecules and 14CO2 in 6 ml of scintillation liquid. After conversion to DPM and correction for scintilation counter efficiency, oxidation rate was calculated as picomoles of oxidized palmitate per minute per milligram of tissue.

Blood and tissue analysis
Blood glucose was measured by glucometer (Accuchek, Roche Diagnostics, IN). Analytical kits were used to determine liver and serum triglycerides (Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO), plasma free fatty acids (Wako Chemicals Inc., Richmond, VA), and total ketones (Wako Chemicals Inc.). Plasma insulin was measured using ELISA kit (Crystal Chem, Downers Grove, IL).

Liver triglycerides were isolated by Folch extraction. Liver glycogen, was isolated from tissue homogenized in 30% (w/v) KOH (1 ml/100 mg of tissue) and hydrolyzed in a boiling water bath for 15 minutes. Samples were centrifuged at 3,000 × g for 5 minutes and 150 μl of supernatant was spotted onto Whatman paper disc. Disc was washed twice with ice cold 70% (v/v) ethanol, dried, submerged into 2 ml of 0.2 mg/ml amyloglucosidase in 50 mM sodium acetate (pH 4.8) and incubated at 55°C for 1 hour. 30-50 μl of reaction were used to determine glucose concentration.

Quantitative reverse transcribed real-time PCR
RNA was isolated using RNA Stat 60 (Tel-Test, Friendswood, TX). cDNA was synthesized using 2 μg of total RNA and iScript™ Advanced cDNA Synthesis Kit (BioRad, Hercules, CA). PCR was run using iTaq Universal SYBR Green Supermix (BioRad) and CFX384 Touch™ Real-Time PCR Detection System (BioRad).

Western blot analysis
Tissue was homogenized in RIPA buffer (Cell Signaling, Denver, MA) with Complete™ protease inhibitors (Roche, Nutley, NJ) followed by two 10 sec sonications at 10% amplitude (Branson, Danbury, CT). Lysates were centrifuged at 21,000 × g for 5 min and supernatant without fat layer was used in Western blotting. Signals were detected using SuperSignal Pico chemiluminiscent substrate (Pierce, Thermo Fisher, Roskford, IL) and ImageQuant LAS 4000 system (GE Healthcare). Antibodies were obtained from the following sources: Cell Signaling: Acc, pAcc(S79), Akt, pAkt(S473), Gs, pGs(S641), Gsk3, pGsk3(S21/9), Insrβ, S6, pS6(S240/244), Tsc1; Santa Cruz (Santa Cruz, CA, USA): Gck; Abcam (Cambridge, MA, USA): Ppib.

eTOC:

Using in vivo stable isotope tracers, Kucejova et al. find that loss of hepatic insulin action stimulates mitochondrial metabolism, and that activation of mTORC1 suppresses mitochondrial metabolism and decreases nutritional flexibility. Together, loss of insulin action and activation of mTORC1 recapitulate certain effects of diet-induced insulin resistance on mitochondrial metabolism.
