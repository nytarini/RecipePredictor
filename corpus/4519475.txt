        The objective of this study was to improve the physicochemical properties and functional qualities of soy based mozzarella cheeses by ultrafiltration (UF) of soy milk blends, adding skim milk instead of cow&#x2019;s milk or increasing the soy milk proportions in cheese milk. Eight types of mozzarella cheeses made using soy milk and analyzed for nutritional, structural, and functional characteristics for 4&#xA0;weeks at 4&#xA0;&#xB0;C. Cheeses made with cow milk, 10, 20, and 30&#xA0;% soy milk in cow milk, skim milk, 10&#xA0;% soy milk in skim milk, and ultrafiltrated 10&#xA0;% soy milk in cow milk for first and second volume concentrations. Refrigerated storage of the soy-mozzarella led to a decrease in total solid, mineral, protein, fat, and lactose contents and rheological characteristics after 2&#xA0;weeks. The nutritive quality of the mozzarella tended to increase proportionally to soy milk content, but the physical and functional qualities decreased. The UF-fortified soy-mozzarella showed more improved qualities among the other soy cheeses like long shelf life, improved nutritional, structural and functional qualities. Blends of 10&#x2013;20&#xA0;% soy milk and UF soy milk blends can be used to achieve good quality, nutritive mozzarella cheese, even with skim milk instead of cow milk in a milk shortage.
