 and widely consumed worldwide because
of their high nutritive value, comparatively low production cost and less cooking
time. Therefore, it has become integral part of human diet all around the globe
(Huang and Ahn, 2018). Poultry sector in
Pakistan has gained massive success in the previous couple of decades. The
production of poultry meat was 1,391 metric tons in Pakistan during
2017&#x2013;2018, an 8% increase in poultry meat production was recorded as compared
to previous year (Government of Pakistan,
2019).
      Coronary heart diseases accounts 17.5 million deaths global each year, while 25%
casualties are connected to cardiovascular diseases (CVDs) yearly in Pakistan (Zubair et al., 2018). Red meat has been
reported to increase the risk of CVDs causing dyslipidemia. Most of the risks are
associated with the high saturated fatty acid content and cholesterol of red meat.
This led to the suggestions for lowering the consumption of red meat and preferring
white meat (Mente et al., 2009). Moreover,
oxidation of the meat lipids and cholesterol have been linked with the atherogenesis
(Guardiola et al., 1996; Kubow 1993). In order to avoid these diseases,
consumers prefer white meat over red meat due to its nutritional value but chicken
meat is more at risk of oxidative rancidity owning to high proportion of
polyunsaturated fatty acids content (Luna et al.,
2010). One of the primary reasons of quality degradation of poultry meat
products is lipid oxidation (Buckley et al.,
1995).
      The oxidation of lipid substances in animals is caused by disproportion between
pro-oxidants and antioxidants in the animal&#x2019;s defense system. The damage of
lipids in animals can be increased within the immediate post slaughter duration and
especially it occurs at some stage in handling, processing, storage, and
transportation. The most effective and viable method for enhancing oxidative balance
in chicken meat is the enrichment of muscles with the antioxidant substances through
feed additives which will be helpful to postpone or lessen oxidative rancidity and
generation of free radical within the resultant muscles. In order to control the
oxidation of poultry meat, different natural (alpha tocopherol, alpha lipoic acid,
and bioactive peptides) and artificial antioxidant compounds are broadly used in
feed to solve the oxidation issues in muscle foods and its products (Ismail et al., 2013). The antioxidants from
biological origin quench the free radicals, via stopping chain reactions, chelation
of metallic ions, preventing the generation of free radicals, degradation of the
peroxides and reducing the localized oxygen concentration (Brannan, 2007).
      Fish protein hydrolysate is an excellent source of biologically active proteins
(Je et al., 2005). Numerous marine
species like Alaska Pollack (Je et al.,
2005), herring (Sathivel et al., 2013), horse mackerel (Magalspis
cordla) have extensively been utilized for manufacturing of bioactive
peptide containing fish protein hydrolysate. Antioxidant activity of biologically
active proteins have been reported against lipid oxidation in number of lipid
systems. Bioactive peptides from food sources also exhibit beneficial health impacts
such as antihypertensive potential and hypocholesterolemic effect (Lee and Hur, 2017).
      Different scientists investigated the antioxidant capacity and lipid stability of
broiler meat by incorporation of natural antioxidant substances in broiler diet. The
results described by Auwal et al. (2017)
inferred that the bioactive peptides in fish protein hydrolysate from stone fish
have potential to chelate ferric ions. DPPH&#x2022; scavenging potential
of fish protein hydrolysate from fresh water carp was reported by Elavarasan et al. (2014). Protein hydrolysate
containing bioactive peptides fractions of blue mussel showed high ABTS scavenging
potential (Wang et al., 2008). Higher TPC of
broiler meat given different feed treatments supplemented with natural bioactive
compounds was observed by Qwele et al.
(2013). Positive impact of dietary antioxidant substances on FRAP of broiler
meat was mentioned by Parveen et al. (2015).
Higher DPPH&#x2022; scavenging potential of broiler meat fed on natural
antioxidant substances was observed than broiler group fed on basal diet (Fasseas et al., 2008; Yasin et al., 2012). Improved ABTS scavenging potential of
chicken breast muscles fed on antioxidant additive was noticed (Azizah et al., 2010).
      Availability of natural antioxidant substances in biological systems can also limit
the production of malondialdehyde (MDA). The production of MDA in broiler meat can
be reduced by inclusion of natural antioxidant substances in broiler feed. Lower
TBARS value of meat enriched with natural antioxidant substances was noticed (Muthukumar et al., 2012). Bioactive peptides
have the potential to donate hydrogen from amino acids to break the oxidation chain
reaction. Biologically active proteins with antioxidant capacity react with
hydroperoxides and convert them into stable compounds thus enhancing the shelf
stability of broiler meat (Jang et al.,
2008). Lower peroxide value in broiler meat fed on natural antioxidant
enriched diet was observed by Khan et al.
(2015).
      Chicken nuggets are prepared from ground chicken meat and seasons by frying at
190&#xB0;C until a crisp and golden color developed. Chicken industrial processed
products such as nuggets are becoming popular in Pakistan. Consumer acceptance of
nuggets is dependent upon color, flavor and texture of the product. Lipid oxidation
in chicken-based products can spoil color flavor and texture of the products (Tanwar et al., 2017). Enrichment of
antioxidants can improve the lipid stability of chicken products. The nuggets from
meat with antioxidant supplemented diet had lower TBARS values as compared to those
prepared by chicken meat without antioxidants. The outcome of this research
indicated that supplementation of broiler feed with antioxidants can reduce the
chances of lipid oxidation in meat products (O&#x2019;Sullivan et al., 2004). The current study was depicted under
the objective of ameliorating the antioxidant status and lipid stability of broiler
meat and physico-chemical characteristics of broiler meat nuggets during storage
through the intervention of biologically active proteins derived from fish waste in
broiler feed.

      Materials and Methods
      All chemicals needed for this study were procured from Sigma Aldrich (St. Louis, MO,
USA). Broilers chicks of 45&#xB1;10 g body weight (180 birds) were obtained from
Olympia chicks Faisalabad, Pakistan. Beds for broiler chicks were prepared by using
fine saw dust. Potassium permanganate and formalin of Sigma Aldrich (USA) were used
to disinfect the broiler pens in the poultry shed were purchased from the scientific
store of Faisalabad. The initial weight of broiler chicks was recorded and
distributed in 18 pens each pen containing 10 birds.

        Preparation of biologically active protein hydrolysate
        A chemical method was used for the extraction of soluble fish proteins as
described by Arnesen et al. (2007). 2 kg
of the minced rahu fish waste including head, tail, skin and fins was mixed with
2 L of water, the pH of mixture was maintained at 11 with 62 mL of 3 molar
sodium hydroxide solution. In first step sample mixture was distributed in equal
volume to centrifuge tubes and centrifugation of sample was performed at
4,000&#xD7;g for 15 min at temperature of 4&#xB0;C. Afterwards supernatant
was cumulated and pellet was dissolved in 2 L of distilled H2O and 15
mL of 3 molar NaOH solution was used to maintain the pH at 11. The second step
of protein extraction was conducted for 1 hour and the sample was centrifuged.
Again, supernatant was cumulated and pellet was dispersed in 2 L of water, 145
mL of hydrochloric acid was used to adjust the pH up to 2. The pellet was again
dispersed in 2L of distilled H2O and the pH was regulated to 2 using
3 molar HCl solution (145 mL) before centrifugation for 15 minutes. All these
supernatants from the three extractions were stocked altogether. pH of the
resultant solution was balanced at 7 via addition of 3 molar NaOH solution. The
samples were placed at 25&#xB0;C to precipitate for 15 minutes and the protein
fraction was extracted by centrifugation at 5,000&#xD7;g for 60 min at
4&#xB0;C.
        Protein hydrolysis was performed in water bath shaker at 150 rpm using alcalase
enzyme under optimized conditions to get maximum degree of hydrolysis at
temperature 46.37&#xB0;C, time of hydrolysis 116.91 minutes, [E]/[S] ratio
1.97% and pH of 7.99. After completion of hydrolysis process sample was heated
at 100&#xB0;C for 10 minutes to discontinue the reaction. Centrifugation of
sample was performed at 4&#xB0;C and 3,025&#xD7;g for 40 min, the
hydrolysates consisting of the antioxidant peptides were collected as the
supernatant then lyophilized and stored at &#x2212;40&#xB0;C prior to
analysis.

        Antioxidant activity of bioactive peptides
        Antioxidant activity of bioactive peptides was determined by DPPH
(2,2-diphenyl-1-picryhydrazyl) radical scavenging activity and hydroxyl radical
scavenging activity.

        2,2-Diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl (DPPH) assay
        DPPH raadical scavenging activity of protein hydrolysate was estimated by the
procedure explained by Hwang et al.
(2013). A 0.25 mM DPPH solution was prepared in methanol 100
&#x3BC;L of 1% sample was added with 100 &#x3BC;L of DPPH solution and allowed
to rest at 25&#xB0;C in dark for half an hour and absorbance of the sample
mixture was estimated at 517 nm. Percentage DPPH&#xB7; scavenging activity of
the fish protein hydrolysate was calculated by applying following equation:
DPPH&#x22C5;scavenging&#x2009;activity&#x2009;(%)=[1&#x2212;(As&#x2212;Ab)]&#x2009;&#xD7;&#x2009;100Blank's&#x2009;&#x2009;absorbance
        Ab = Absorbance of blank
        As = Absorbance of sample

        Hydroxyl radical scavenging activity
        Hydroxyl radical scavenging activity was quantified by the procedure given by
Wang et al. (2008). 1 mL of ample
solution was added with the 1 mL of 750 &#x3BC;M 1,10-phenanthroline solution.
pH of this mixture was adjusted up to 7.4 by adding 0.2 molar sodium phosphate
buffer. After that 1 mL of 750 uM ferrous sulfate solution was added and
reaction was initiated by mixing the 1 mL of H2O2. Mixture
is heated at 37&#xB0;C for 60 minutes in water bath. Spectrophotometric
absorption was estimated at wavelength of 536 nm. Glutathione reductase was
utilized as control and hydroxyl radical scavenging activity was quantified by
the given equation. OH&#x2009;&#x2009;scavenging&#x2009;&#x2009;activity&#x2009;(%)=As&#x2212;Ao&#xD7;100Ac&#x2212;Ao
        Where,
        As = Sample&#x2019;s absorbance
        Ao = Absorbance of the solution in which sample was replaced by
equivalent vol. of dH2O
        Ac = Absorbance of the solution in which sample and
H2O2 replaced by equivalent vol. of
dH2O

        Experimental plan
        Different levels of biologically active proteins prepared from fish waste were
added in broiler feed according to the plan described in Table 1. The birds were distributed into six groups each
group with 3 replicates and each replicate was comprised of ten birds, 180 birds
were purchased for experiment. The nutritional composition of broiler basal diet
is depicted in Table 2. The nutritional
composition of the basal diet consisted of crude protein 21.13%, Lysine 1.10%
and methionine 0.52%. The calculated metabolized energy for 1 kg of basal diet
was 2,903 kcal.

        Experimental site management
        Research trial was carried out in student research area at Poultry Research
Center, University of Agriculture Faisalabad. The research room was thoroughly
white washed. The room was disinfected with the potassium permanganate and
formalin before the start of the trial. Saw dust (2-inch layer) was used to
prepare the pen beds. Eighteen pens each of twelve square feet were prepared.
All the feeders and drinkers were washed properly and disinfected with aqueous
solution of potassium permanganate. During first week of trial temperature of
experimental room was maintained at 34&#xB0;C, which was lowered by 5&#xB0;C
till it reached to 24&#xB0;C. Proper light and ventilation was maintained
during experimental trial. The fresh water and feed was provided to
bird&#x2019;s ad-libitum.

        Bird&#x2019;s vaccination
        A sugar solution of 50 g per 5 L was provided to broiler chicks within first 2
hours of birds&#x2019; allocation in pens. To prevent the bacterial infection
birds were provided with the Cotrium-50 solution (one gram per five liters of
water) at the age of two days. Chicks were treated with ND vaccine to prevent
the New Castle Disease at age of 3 days.
        At the age of 10 days chicks were treated with the infectious bursal disease
(IBD) vaccine to prevent the wild cough. At the age of 2 weeks birds were
treated with the vaccine to prevent the Gamboro Disease. Birds were vaccinated
with ND at the age of 22 days and with Lasota vaccine at age of 28 to prevent
the New Castle Disease.

        Slaughtering of the broiler birds
        After the completion of experimental trial, three birds from each treatment were
picked and slaughtered by following the Halal Ethical guidelines for further
analysis. The broiler breast was separated and packaged in polythene zip bags.
The meat samples were put under freezing storage at &#x2212;18&#xB0;C for
further analysis.

        Antioxidant potential of broiler meat

          Sample preparation
          The meat samples from breast muscles (5 g) were homogenized using the 20%
glycerol and phosphate buffer (pH 7.4) with homogenizer. After giving the
proper rest time in ice cold water mixture was filtered by muslin cloth to
make it free from connective tissues.

          Total phenolic contents (TPC)
          TPC in broiler meat was estimated using the technique explained by Senevirathne et al. (2006). The 100
&#x3BC;L prepared broiler meat sample was added to 2.5 mL distilled water,
500 &#x3BC;L of 95% ethanol and 250 &#x3BC;L of Folin-Ciocalteu reagent
(50%). After that above mixture was given rest time for 5 minutes, then 500
&#x3BC;L of Na2CO3 (5%) was added to this solution.
The final mixture was swirled in vortex meter and placed in dark for 1 hour.
The sample absorbance was estimated at 725 nm through spectrophotometer. TPC
of broiler meat samples were quantified as Gallic acid equivalent (mg of
gallic acid/100 g of meat sample).

          2,2-Diphenyl-1-picrihydrzyl (DPPH) assay
          DPPH scavenging capacity of broiler meat sample was evaluated using the
approach explained by Hwang et al.
(2013). A 0.25 mM solution of DPPH was developed in methanol. 100
&#x3BC;L of 1% sample was added with 100 &#x3BC;L of DPPH solution and
kept at 25&#xB0;C in dark for half an hour and sample absorbance was taken
at 517 nm via spectrophotometer. Percentage DPPH&#xB7; scavenging activity
of the broiler meat was calculated by applying given equation: DPPH&#x22C5;scavenging&#x2009;activity&#x2009;(%)=[1&#x2212;(As&#x2212;Ab)]&#x2009;&#xD7;&#x2009;100Blank's&#x2009;&#x2009;absorbance
          Ab = Blank absorbance
          As = Sample absorbance

          Ferric reducing antioxidant power (FRAP)
          FRAP in broiler meat was measured by adopting the technique explained by
Oyaizu (1986). A homogenized meat
sample of 200 &#x3BC;L was added to 500 &#x3BC;L of 0.2 molar sodium
phosphate buffer to adjust the pH at 6.6. Resultant solution was kept in
water bath at 50&#xB0;C for 20 min. The centrifugation of the sample
mixture was performed at 2,200&#xD7;g for 10 min after adding with the 2.5
mL 10% trichloroacetic acid. 100 &#x3BC;L of ferric chloride solution
(0.1%) and 500 &#x3BC;L of distilled H2O was added to
supernatant. The spectrophotometric absorbance of the sample was estimated
at 700 nm. The FRAP was calculated as &#x3BC;mol/Fe2+/g
meat.

        Extent of lipid oxidation in broiler meat

          Peroxide value (POV)
          POV of breast meat was estimated by method outlined by the Sallam (2007). A meat sample of 5 g was
placed in glass stoppered flask of 250 mL and heated in water bath for 3
minutes at 60&#xB0;C to melt the fat. A 30 mL (3:2 v/v) mixture of acetic
acid and chloroform solution was added to sample and homogenized thoroughly.
The resulting mixture was filtered, 0.5 mL of KI solution was added to
filtrate and stored in dark place for 1 hour. This mixture containing starch
solution as indicator was titrated against the 0.3 N sodium thiosulfate
solution. Peroxide value was calculated as milliequivelant per kilogram
(meq/kg) of meat. Peroxide&#x2009;value&#x2009;(meq/kg)=Vol.of&#x2009;titration&#xA0;used&#x2009;&#xD7;&#x2009;Normality&#x2009;of&#x2009;Na2S2O3Weight&#x2009;of&#x2009;sample&#x2009;in&#x2009;kg

          TBARS assay
          Thiobarbituric acid reactive species (TBARS) of homogenized breast meat
samples were analyzed by adopting the technique outlined by Asghar et al. (1989). The peroxidation
reaction was commenced by addition of 0.1 molar FeSO4
7&#xB7;H2O (700 &#x3BC;L) and 0.1 molar hydrogen peroxide
(200 &#x3BC;L) in 7 mL of homogenized meat sample in a flask and heated in
a water bath up to 37&#xB0;C. After each 30 minutes 1 mL of aliquot was
removed from reaction flask for the period of 2 hours and added to the
solution containing 0.4% TBA, 10% trichloroacetic acid and HCl of 0.25N. The
resultant mixture was kept in water bath for 15 min, cooled and centrifuged.
Supernatant was collected and spectrophotometric absorbance was estimated at
532 nm. The amount of lipid oxidation products was quantified by following
the given formula. TBARS was calculated as mg MDA/kg of meat. TBA&#x2009;value=(As&#x2212;Ab)&#xD7;Sample&#x2009;volume0.000156&#xD7;1,000/mL

          Product development (nuggets)
          Nuggets were prepared from breast meat of broiler from all treatments by
following the standard recipe as 250 g broiler breast meat, 60 g fine flour,
5 g garlic paste 50 g onion paste, 10 g salt, 40 g bread crumbs, one egg and
oil for frying. All ingredients were mixed with minced broiler meat and
mixed thoroughly. After that mixture was formed in to discs of 12 mm
thickness and 30 mm diameter. When meat nuggets were prepared, these were
coated with corn flour then dipped in egg and again coated with bread
crumbs. Nuggets were fried in cooking oil at 180&#xB0;C till dark brown
color was developed. Total 150 nuggets 25 from each treatment group were
prepared. After cooling at room temperature nuggets were packed in polythene
zip bags and stored at freezing temperature &#x2212;18&#xB0;C for further
analysis.

        Physico-chemical and quality characteristics of broiler nuggets

          pH measurements
          The pH of nuggets prepared from broiler breast muscles s was estimated
utilizing the methodology explained by Turienzo et al. (2011). Before pH determination calibration of
pH meter was performed using buffer solutions of pH 4, 7, and 10. A 10 g of
thee sample was homogenized thoroughly in distilled H2O. The pH
of nuggets from each treatment sample was estimated by dipping the probe of
pH meter in meat sample.

          Water-holding capacity (WHC)
          WHC of the breast nuggets was determined by filter press method as mentioned
by Wierbicki and Deatherage (1958).
One-gram sample of nuggets was kept between 18 pieces of filter paper (11 cm
diameter). A pressure of 2.81 kg was applied for 5 minutes. A loss of weight
after pressing the sample was estimated and termed as expressed juice. Total
moisture content of the nugget sample was calculated by AOAC (2002) method.
The water holding capacity of nuggets was determined by following
equation.

          Color measurements
          Color of the nuggets was determined by a tristimulus colorimeter (Color Test
Meter II) at uniform storage intervals (0, 15, 30, and 45 days) as outlined
by (El-Gasim et al., 2000).
Colorimeter was calibrated using standard for darkness and lightness (54 CTn
for dark and 151 CTn for light). Sample was placed under photocell of
colorimeter to determine the color transmittance number (CTn).

          Texture analysis
          The shear force for broiler nuggets was measured by texture analyzer (Model
TX-XT2, stable microsystem, surrey, UK) using the method given by Piga et al. (2005).

          Statistical analysis
          All experiments were performed in triplicate. Statistical analysis of the
data obtained from all experiments was performed through completely
randomized design using the &#x201C;Statistic 8.1&#x201D; statistics
software package. Moreover two-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) was
performed to check the level of significance for all parameters. Mean
comparisons for variable parameters were performed using Tukey&#x2019;s
test.

      Result and Discussion

        Antioxidant activity of bioactive peptides
        The free (DPPH) radical scavenging activity and hydroxyl radical scavenging
activity in fish bioactive peptides was recorded 51.39% and 54.61% respectively.
Current results for DPPH scavenging activity of fish bioactive peptides are in
line with the findings of Jeevitha et al.
(2014). The capacity of rahu fish protein hydrolysate to scavenge
DPPH&#x2022; could be due to their ability to stabilize these
free radicals in reaction medium and to terminate the propagation of free
radicals (Kong and Xiong, 2006). This
effect might also be due to the specific amino acid composition and amino acid
sequence of bioactive peptides. Hydrophobic amino acids have the ability to
chelate free radicals and can trap lipids by forming physical barriers around
the fat droplets which inhibits the free radical chain reactions. Zarei et al. (2012) have earlier reported
the increase in DPPH&#x2022; scavenging activity with the increase in
protein hydrolysis time. The findings related to hydroxyl radical scavenging
activity of presents study are in support to the results obtained by Bernardi et al. (2016) and Jeevitha et al. (2014) based on fish
protein hydrolysates. Bioactive peptides consisting of hydrophobic amino acid
residues, including His, Cys and Met have hydroxyl radical scavenging capacity
(Hernandez-Ledesma et al., 2005),
while the presence of aromatic amino acids (Tyr, Trp, and Phe) give the peptides
higher potential to donate electrons (Girgih et
al., 2015).

        Antioxidant potential of broiler breast meat

          Total phenolic contents (TPC) of broiler breast meat
          TPC revealed about the antioxidant potential of muscle tissues; higher TPC
present in meat indicate the higher free radical scavenging potential.
Phenolic compounds present in meat enhance the quality, shelf stability and
acceptability of meat products as antioxidants and flavor compounds. These
phenolic compounds have the potential to react with the hydroxyl and lipid
radicals and stabilize them. The results of TPC of broiler breast meat
provided with different concentrations of biologically active proteins in
feed are displayed in Table 3. The
supplementation of the biologically active proteins in broiler feed improved
the TPC of broiler breast meat with momentous (p&lt;0.05) difference
among samples from birds fed on different levels of biologically active
proteins. The broiler birds fed on highest level of bioactive peptides
(T6 =250 mg/kg of feed) showed highest TPC 161.2 mg GAE/100 g
in breast meat tissues at 0 day of storage which decreased during storage
period to 153.1 mg GAE/100 g of meat at 180th day of storage. The
lowest TPC 111.7 mg GAE/100 g in broiler breast meat were observed in
T1 at 0 day which further decreased to 104.2 mg GAE/100 g
meat. A 30% increase in TPC values was observed in broiler breast meat by
adding bioactive peptides in broiler feed at concentration of 250 mg/kg of
feed. These findings are in consistent with findings mentioned by Selim et al. (2015). Antioxidant
potential of TPC was reported by Chanda and
Dave (2009). The potential of phenolic compounds to scavenge free
radicals was also described by Jyotsna
Mishra et al. (2007). Basmacioglu
et al. (2003) also reported the increased level of TPC in chicken
meat fed on antioxidant enriched diet.

in broiler feed improved the DPPH&#x2022; scavenging potential of
broiler breast meat with substantial (p&lt;0.05) difference among

                All values expressed as mean&#xB1;SD (n=3).

          The maximum DPPH&#x2022; scavenging activity was noticed in
T6 at 0 day (85.1%) which decreased to 78.4% at
180th day of storage. The DPPH&#x2022; scavenging
activity of T1 at 0 day was witnessed 57.1% which further
decreased to 51.2% at 180th day of storage. It has been observed
that supplementation of broiler feed with bioactive peptides had witnessed
to be effectual in improving the antioxidant capacity of broiler breast
meat. The dietary addition of bioactive peptides in broiler feed improved
the antioxidant content of muscles and enhanced the shelf life by
maintaining lipid stability and quality of meat through scavenging the
pro-oxidant substances. Mechanism elaborates that substances with
antioxidant potential inactivate the free radicals produced in muscles and
enhance oxidation stability of meat. Bioactive peptides quench the free
radicals and oxygen reactive species subsequently inhibit the oxidative
damage in biological systems (Kim et al.,
2001). Higher DPPH&#x2022; scavenging activity
indicated the higher antioxidant content present in broiler meat which have
the potential to donate one proton to form a stable DPPH2
compound thus scavenging the free radicals (Prior et al., 2005). These findings are in close harmony with
the findings observed by Yasin et al.
(2012). Likewise, Fasseas et al.
(2008) reported the higher free radical scavenging potential of
broiler meat fed on natural antioxidant substances than boilers fed on basal
diet. Easssawy et al. (2016) also
reported the improved DPPH&#x2022; scavenging potential of
broiler breast meat through quinoa seed extract as dietary antioxidant
substances. Jung et al. (2010) also
found positive effect of dietary natural antioxidant substances on broiler
breast meat.

          FRAP of broiler breast meat
          The results of FRAP of broiler breast meat from birds given different
concentrations of biologically active proteins in feed are displayed in
Table 5. The supplementation of
the bioactive peptides in broiler feed improved the FRAP of broiler breast
meat with significant (p&lt;0.05) difference among samples from birds
fed on various levels of biologically active proteins. The FRAP was
significantly (p&lt;0.05) lower in all treated groups during storage
duration of 180 days. Highest (682.6 &#x3BC;mol/Fe2+/g
meat) was noticed in T6 at 0 day which gradually decreased during
storage period (665.3 &#x3BC;mol/Fe2+/g meat) at
180th day of storage. The lowest FRAP value (541
&#x3BC;mol/Fe2+/g meat) was noticed in T1
at 0 day which decreased further to (527
&#x3BC;mol/Fe2+/g meat) at 180th day of
storage. The antioxidant content present in broiler muscles tend to reduce
ferric ion (Fe3+) to ferrous ion (Fe2+)
by donating one electron. Results of higher metal chelating potential also
indicated the inhibition of tissue damage due to oxidation in animal body.
Higher FRAP values in broiler meat fed on T6 (250 mg bioactive
peptides/kg of feed) was owning to the antioxidant capacity of ingredients
used in broiler diet. The current findings were comparable to the results
discussed in previous studies. Higher metal ion reducing potential was
noticed in meat enriched with natural antioxidant substances in comparison
with control treatment (Banerjee et al.,
2012). Moreover, Amarowicz et al.
(2005) mentioned the direct relationship between FRAP and
antioxidant activity by chelating the free radicals and discontinuing the
oxidation chain reactions. Parveen et al.
(2015) elucidated the impact of flax seed and alpha-tocopherol
acetate on FRAP of broiler leg meat and found significant effect of dietary
enrichment through natural antioxidant sources.

        Extent of lipid oxidation of broiler meat

          Peroxide value (POV) of broiler breast meat
          Oxidation occurs at the position of unsaturated bonds in fatty acids. A
number of oxidation compounds such as hydroperoxides and free radical are
produced during oxidation of unsaturated fatty acids. Quantification of
these first stage oxidation products (peroxides and hydro-peroxides) is
known as peroxide value. The results of POV of broiler breast meat fed on
different concentrations of bioactive peptides are displayed in Table 6. The supplementation of the
biologically active proteins broiler feed reduced the POV of broiler breast
meat with considerable (p&lt;0.05) difference among samples from birds
fed on various levels of bioactive peptides. The POV content was
significantly (p&lt;0.05) increased in all treated groups during storage
duration of 180 days. Lowest peroxide value (0.68 meq/kg meat) was observed
in T6 at 0 day which gradually increased during storage period
(5.68 meq/kg meat) at 180th day of storage. The highest POV value
(0.82 meq/kg meat) was noticed in T1 at 0 day which further
increased to (7.21 meq/kg meat) at 180th day of storage. Decrease
in POV values of broiler breast meat was observed through supplementation of
broiler feed as compared to control diet. Current studies are supported by
Khan et al. (2015) who reported
lower POV in broiler meat fed on natural antioxidant enriched diet. These
findings are also corroborated by outcomes of Mohmed et al. (2008) who found that antioxidant
enrichment of broiler meat reduced POV value while POV increased with
storage duration. Kastoe (2013) and
Parveen et al. (2015) examined
the efficacy of linseed meal enrichment in broiler diet on antioxidant
status of broiler meat and found significant difference of treatments on
reducing peroxide value of broiler muscles.

          TBARS of broiler breast meat
          TBA reactive substances are produced due to oxidation of lipids as result of
oxidative stress and comprised of aldehydes, ketones and hydroperoxides.
TBARS analysis results are presented in MDA is a compound that produced by
degradation of lipid peroxides of polyunsaturated fatty acids. Results
regarding TBARS of breast meat from broilers fed on different concentrations
of bioactive peptides are displayed in Table
7. The dietary supplementation of bioactive peptides
substantially (p&lt;0.05) reduced the TBARS of broiler breast meat. A
momentous (p&lt;0.05) difference among samples from birds fed on various
levels of bioactive peptides was noticed. The TBARS content was momentously
(p&lt;0.05) increased in all treated groups during storage duration of
180 days. Lowest TBARS value (0.13 mg MDA/kg meat) was observed in
T6 at 0 day which gradually increased during storage period
(4.56 mg MDA/kg) at 180th day of storage. The highest TBARS value
(0.21 mg MDA/kg meat) was observed in T1 at 0 day which further
increased to (6.66 mg MDA/kg meat) at 180th day of storage.
Decrease in TBARS values of broiler breast meat was observed through
bioactive peptide supplementation of broiler feed as compared to control
diet. The higher values obtained with the TBA test have been attributed to
several other lipid oxidation products such as alkenals, alkadienals, other
aldehydes, and ketones. During storage of meat products deterioration occurs
due to the rancidity resulting from oxidation of triglycerides at double
bond site. It has been evident from the previous studies that the oxidation
of meat lipids during storage is responsible for huge losses (Sohaib et al., 2017). The results of
the instant study are supported by results reported by Selim et al. (2015). Comparable outcomes were reported
by Naveena et al. (2008) who found
the positive effect of natural antioxidant substances enrichment in reducing
the lipid oxidation of broiler meat. Bioactive peptides have the potential
to donate hydrogen from amino acids to break the oxidation chain reaction.
Young et al. (2003) reported the
decreased MDA production in broiler meat fed on diet supplemented with the
ascorbic acid and alpha-tocopherol. Jiang et
al. (2009) reported the positive impact of dietary soy isoflavone
in reducing the MDA production in broiler meat. Zahid et al. (2018) found the positive impact of
incorporation of natural antioxidant substances on oxidation stability of
beef patties during cold storage.

          Highest pH of breast nuggets at 0 day (6.22) was observed in T6
which gradually increased to 6.53 during storage period of 45 days. The
lowest pH at 0 day (5.72) was observed in T1, which further
increased to 5.94 at 45th day of storage. pH is an important
parameter to determine the shelf life, freshness and desirability of poultry
meat products. The WHC and yield of meat is also affected by pH of meat.
During storage of meat microbial population increased which might be
responsible for production of volatile bases by protein breakdown which
raise the pH of broiler meat. This situation can be improved with improving
antioxidant status of broiler muscles because oxidation of meat is
restricted in presence of antioxidant substances. Outcomes of instant
research are supported by the results reported by Jang et al. (2008) who described that higher pH in
breast meat of broiler fed on plant extract enriched diet was observed as
compared to basal diet. Current results are also comparable to the outcomes
of Kumar and Tanwar (2011) who found increment in pH during storage period.
The increment in pH value might be due to the development of volatile basis
by degradation of proteins during storage. Jiang et al. (2009) also found the increment in pH value through
dietary supplementation of broiler feed by soy isoflavone as source of
natural antioxidant compounds. Edens
(2001) also reported the increase in pH value of broiler meat
through dietary supplementation of organic selenium.
          Highest color value of breast nuggets at 0 day (130 CTn) was observed in
T6 which gradually decreased during storage period (112 CTn)
at 45th day of storage. The lowest color value 104 CTn at 0 day
was observed in T1, which further decreased to 100 CTn at
45th day of storage. Current study indicated that color
values increased with increasing the bioactive peptides supplementation
level in feed. The higher color values indicated the red color of nuggets
while lower color values indicated brown color of meat products (Arshad et al., 2016). The outcomes of
the current investigation are in corroboration with the results of Chandralekha et al. (2012) who
described that use of pomegranate based natural antioxidant supplementation
in chicken meat balls had positive impact on color of meat product. Same
findings were mentioned by Kala et al.
(2007) in chicken patties. The color values of stored chicken
nuggets decreased during storage which can be ascribed to moisture loss and
oxidation of meat proteins. Jiang et al.
(2009) reported that dietary soy isoflavone significantly
improved the color of broiler meat. Kim et
al. (2019) reported that dietary interventions of humic acid and
blueberry powder in animal diet significantly improved the color values of
meat.
          Lowest values for shear force (N) of nuggets from broiler breast at 0 day
(1,114) was observed in T6 which gradually increased during
storage period (1,129) at 45th day of storage. The highest shear
force value at 0 day (1,143) was recorded in T1, which further
increased to (1,157) at 45th day of storage. The shear force
required for broiler nuggets fed on supplemented feed was lower than control
groups. This decrease can be ascribed to the denaturation of desmin proteins
which restrict the removal of moisture from intra and extra myofibrillar
space. Bioactive peptides supplementation can delay the oxidation which can
reduce the drip loss improving the texture of broiler meat products. Mean
values regarding shear force for breast nuggets stored on freezing
temperature increased which can be ascribed to aggregation and cross linking
of myofibrillar proteins as oxidation prevails during this duration. The
current findings are also validated by results of Moran et al. (2012) who described that the mean values
of shear force decreased due to antioxidant supplementation of broiler meat.
Current findings are also substantiated by results of Ruiz-Ramirez et al. (2005) who found that texture of
meat products become harder and toughness of product increased during
storage.
          Highest WHC of breast nuggets at 0 day (86.23%) was observed in T6
which gradually decreased to 79.53% during storage period of 45 days. The
lowest WHC at 0 day (80.90%) was observed in T1, which further
decreased to 74.23% during 45 days of storage. The WHC of nuggets prepared
from meat of treated groups was higher than control group. The WHC increased
during storage because texture of product become firm with the progress of
storage duration ascribed to moisture loss. Rowe et al. (2004) described that antioxidant substances present
in meat have impact on proteolysis of meat proteins. WHC of postmortem
muscles was affected by pH change protein degradation which initiated with
the action of &#x3BC;-calpain (Huff-Lonergan and Lonergan 2005). Jiang et al. (2009) reported the 17% increase in WHC of
broiler meat fed on 40 mg soy isoflavone/kg of feed. Likewise, the outcomes
of current investigation are also confirmed by the results of Ruiz-Ramirez et al. (2005) who
described that texture of meat patties became harder and WHC was reduced
with the course of time during storage duration. Delles (2013) also described the improvement in WHC of
broiler breast meat during storage fed on tocopherol and selenium-based
antioxidants.

      Conclusion
      Dietary supplementation of bioactive peptides produced from fish waste demonstrated
favorable impact on reducing lipid oxidation than control treatment. Among different
treatments the group fed on highest level of bioactive peptides i.e. 250 mg/kg feed,
showed higher TPC, DPPH, FRAP values and significantly lower peroxide value and MDA
content during freeze storage of 180 days. Likewise, dietary interventions of
bioactive peptides in broiler feed also improved quality parameters (pH, color,
texture, WHC) of broiler nuggets. The results demonstrated that application of
dietary bioactive peptides can be potential substitutes to commercial antioxidant
substances, for enhancing the shelf-stability of poultry meat during frozen storage.
In future the development of strategies to use natural dietary antioxidant
substances in animal feed requires more attention of researchers.
