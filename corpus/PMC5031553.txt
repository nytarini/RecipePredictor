Hepatic lipogenesis is nutritionally regulated, i.e., downregulated during fasting and upregulated during the postprandial state, as an adaptation to the nutritional environment. While alterations in the expression level of the transcription factor SREBP-1c are known to be critical for nutritionally-regulated lipogenesis, upstream mechanisms governing Srebf1 gene expression remain unclear. Here we show that the fasting-induced transcription factor KLF15, a key regulator of gluconeogenesis, forms a complex with LXR/RXR, specifically on the Srebf1 promoter. This complex recruits the corepressor RIP140 instead of the coactivator SRC1, resulting in reduced Srebf1 and thus downstream lipogenic enzyme expression during the early and euglycemic period of fasting prior to hypoglycemia and PKA activation. Through this mechanism, KLF15 overexpression specifically ameliorates hypertriglyceridemia without affecting LXR-mediated cholesterol metabolism. These findings reveal a key molecular link between glucose and lipid metabolism with therapeutic implications for the treatment of hyperlipidemia.

eTOC blurb
Takeuchi et al. find that KLF15 suppresses SREBP-1c transcription through interaction with the LXR/RXR/RIP140 complex. Through this mechanism, KLF15 promotes a fasting adaptation by switching lipogenesis to gluconeogenesis. KLF15 overexpression ameliorates hypertriglyceridemia without affecting LXR-mediated cholesterol metabolism.





   INTRODUCTION
In the postprandial state the liver takes up nutrients through the portal vein and excess carbohydrates are converted into triglycerides, whereas in a fasting state this lipogenic pathway shuts down. Previous studies have shown that sterol regulatory element-binding protein-1c (SREBP-1c) plays an important role in controlling hepatic lipogenesis (Shimano et al., 1999; Yahagi et al., 1999; Yahagi et al., 2002), leading us to examine the mechanism of this nutritional regulation of SREBP-1c expression.

Upon fasting, the mRNA expression of the Srebf1 gene is markedly decreased, resulting in reduced amounts of SREBP-1c protein in liver nuclei, with corresponding decreases in the mRNAs for SREBP-1-activated target genes such as fatty acid synthase (gene name: Fasn), a rate-limiting enzyme for lipogenesis (Horton et al., 1998). Previously we and other authors showed that Liver X Receptor (LXR), a nuclear receptor family member, transcriptionally regulates the Srebf1 gene expression (Repa et al., 2000; Yoshikawa et al., 2001). It has also been shown that insulin-dependent (Chen et al., 2004; Chen et al., 2007; Kim et al., 1998; Shimomura et al., 1999; Sun et al., 2016) and insulin-independent (Haas et al., 2012; Matsuzaka et al., 2004) upstream mechanisms regulate SREBP-1 levels. Overall, the precise molecular mechanism by which LXR regulates Srebf1 gene expression under distinct nutritional conditions remains unclear.

Here we show through a series of experiments involving a genome-wide screening for transcription factors that fasting-induced Krüppel-like factor 15 (KLF15) interacts with LXR to repress Srebf1 gene transcription as the primary mechanism of this nutritional regulation. The Krüppel-like family of transcription factors is a subclass of Cys2/His2 zinc-finger DNA-binding proteins, and KLF15 is expressed in multiple tissues including the liver, white and brown adipose, kidney, heart, and skeletal muscle, with the strongest expression levels occurring in the liver and kidney (Gray et al., 2002). The hepatic abundance of KLF15 is induced during the fasted state, and KLF15 is known to contribute to the regulation of gluconeogenesis in the liver (Gray et al., 2007; Teshigawara et al., 2005).

RESULTS
Identification of NuRE on Srebf1c promoter by in vivo Ad-luc analyses
The mRNA expression of hepatic Srebf1 gene is tightly regulated by nutritional conditions. Using in vivo reporter gene analyses with reporter-transgenic mice, we previously showed that this nutritional regulation of the Srebf1 gene occurs at the transcriptional level and that a 2.2 kb region of the 5′-flanking sequence on the Srebf1c promoter is sufficient for this regulation (Takeuchi et al., 2007). Moreover, we previously established an intra-organ assay system for directly estimating the activity of the Srebf1c promoter in the livers of living animals using an adenovirus encoding the Srebf1c promoter linked to a luciferase reporter gene (Takeuchi et al., 2010). Using this in vivo Ad-luc promoter analysis technique, we attempted to identify the nutritional regulatory cis-element on the Srebf1c promoter; the luciferase reporter genes driven by different lengths of the Srebf1c promoter (ranging from 2200 to 150 bp) were adenovirally transduced into mouse liver, and the transcriptional activity was assessed by measuring the luciferase activity with an IVIS imaging system (Figure 1A). From this experiment, the responsible element was found to be located within −250 to −150 bp upstream of the transcription start site. This result was confirmed by experiments using another series of adenovirus constructs encoding different partial sequences of the Srebf1c promoter to estimate the enhancer activity (Figure S1A).

Next, we investigated the −250 ~ −150 bp region in detail; this region contains two LXR-binding elements (LXREs) (Yoshikawa et al., 2001). Intriguingly, the two LXREs alone were not sufficient for nutritional regulation, although they exhibited a complete response to an LXR ligand (Figure 1B), suggesting that nutritional regulation is not brought about by changes in the ligand concentration. Further scrutiny clarified that a cis-element flanking the LXRE besides the two LXREs is indispensable for nutritional regulation (Figure 1C); therefore we designated this element as the “nutritional regulatory element (NuRE)”, which was subsequently shown to exert a suppressive effect on the Srebf1c promoter in a fasting state (Figure 1D and S1B). Consistent with this finding, an electrophoretic mobility shift assay showed a fasting-specific band (Figure 1E), suggesting that some fasting-acting transcription factor(s) in liver nuclei that binds to NuRE may be involved in the suppression of Srebf1c promoter activity during fasting.

Previous reports have indicated the involvement of LXR/RXR in the regulation of Srebf1c promoter activity (Repa et al., 2000; Yoshikawa et al., 2001), as supported by our own data demonstrating that the simultaneous knockdown of both LXRα and β markedly reduced the nutritional response of Srebf1c promoter activity (Figure S1C–S1E). Based on these lines of evidence and the fact that the mRNA and protein expression levels as well as the DNA binding of LXRα/β were not altered by dietary manipulations (Figure 2F), we hypothesized that this unknown transcription factor binding to NuRE conferred a negative regulatory effect on LXR/RXR transcriptional activity.

TFEL genome-wide screen of trans-acting factor(s) for NuRE
To identify the hypothetical transcription factor(s) that binds to NuRE and represses LXR/RXR on the Srebf1c promoter, we screened 1,588 genome-wide transcription factor genes included in the TFEL (Transcription Factor Expression Library; described in a related paper (Yahagi and Takeuchi, 2016)), and assessed the suppressive effects of individual transcription factors against the NuRE plus two LXREs promoter activity in the presence of cotransfected LXRα/RXRα (Figure 1F, S1F, and S1G). After three rounds of screening, two transcription factors, KLF15 and KLF4, were identified as candidates (Figure 1G and S1H). KLF15 and KLF4 suppressed the NuRE plus two LXREs promoter in an NuRE-dependent manner, while KLF family members other than KLF15 and KLF4 did not (Figure 2A). In addition, electrophoretic mobility shift assays demonstrated that recombinant KLF15 and KLF4 proteins bind to the NuRE probe (Figure 2B, S2A, and S2B). This element includes a CCCCATTC sequence that resembles the CCCCACCC consensus motif of KLF family members (Jiang et al., 2008).

These results were further supported by an in vivo mutation analysis which demonstrated that the mutation at the KLF-binding site decreased the response of the native Srebf1c promoter activity to dietary manipulations (Figure S2C and S2D). The DNA sequences of this KLF-binding site as well as the two LXREs are highly conserved among mammals (Figure 2C).

Fasting-induced KLF15 binds to NuRE
Next we examined the KLF15 and KLF4 expression levels in the liver. Several KLFs are known to be widely expressed in various organs involved in energy metabolism (Gray et al., 2007; Mori et al., 2005; Teshigawara et al., 2005; Uchida et al., 2000). The expression of KLF15 in the liver was robust and markedly increased with fasting (Figure 2D), consistent with previous reports (Takashima et al., ; Teshigawara et al., 2005). By contrast, hepatic KLF4 expression was a thousand fold lower. Accordingly, the nuclear protein detected using the electrophoretic mobility shift assay to bind to NuRE during fasting was identified as KLF15 based on the disappearance of the band when adding anti-KLF15 antibody (Figure 2E). Futher, a chromatin immunoprecipitation assays showed that KLF15 binding to the NuRE was markedly increased in the fasting state compared with the re-fed state (Figure 2F). In contrast, the elevation of KLF4 expression to the two fold level of the fasting condition using adenovirus had no effects on Srebf1c transcription (Figure S2E–S2H). Based on these data, we excluded KLF4 as a candidate for the NuRE-binding transcription factor and focused on KLF15 in the following studies.

Role of KLF15 in Srebf1 regulation
To clarify the role of KLF15 in the regulation of Srebf1 gene expression in the in vivo liver, we examined the influences of the forced expression or the knock-down of KLF15 using adenoviruses. Interestingly, forced overexpression of KLF15 in re-fed mouse livers to levels comparable to those observed in the fasted state led to complete repression of Srebf1c promoter activity (Figure 3A, S3A, and S3B), a decrease in the mRNA and nuclear protein levels of SREBP-1 (Figure 3B and S3C), a decrease in the promoter activity and mRNA level of Fasn (Figure 3B and 3C), and consequently a decrease in plasma triglyceride level (Figure 3D). The suppressive effect of KLF15 on Fasn mRNA level was completely abolished by the enforced expression of SREBP-1c (Figure S3D), demonstrating that the effect of KLF15 on hepatic lipogenesis is mediated via suppression of SREBP-1c. The adenovirally transduced KLF15 also repressed Srebf1 expression while inducing Pck1 (gene name for phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase, the rate-limiting enzyme in gluconeogenesis) in primary hepatocytes (Figure S3E and S3F). In contrast, the mRNA level of Abca1, another representative target gene of LXR, was not influenced by KLF15 overexpression (Figure 3B), demonstrating that this KLF15-mediated suppression of LXR is dependent on NuRE and therefore specific to the Srebf1c promoter.

Conversely, when we evaluated the contribution of KLF15 in the fasting state by knockdown, the promoter activity as well as the expressions of Srebf1 and consequently Fasn genes were markedly elevated despite the fasting condition, whereas Pck1 expression was significantly decreased (Figure 3E, 3F, S3G, and S3H). The two shRNAs exerted essentially the same effects on the expression levels of SREBP-1c, excluding the possibility of off-target effects (Figure S3I–S3K). In contrast, the mRNA level of Abca1 was not affected by KLF15 knockdown, again showing that the KLF15-mediated inhibition of LXR is specific to the Srebf1c promoter. The effect of KLF15 knockdown was shown to be dependent on NuRE (Figure S3L).

To further check the validity of our model, we analyzed KLF15 knockout mice. KLF15 knockout mice exhibited significantly higher activities of Srebf1c promoter at an early stage of fasting (6 hours of fasting) as assessed by luciferase reporter assay quantified using in vivo imaging system (Figure 3G). In accordance with this, the rapid decrease of Srebf1c, Fasn mRNA and plasma TG as well as the rapid increase in Pck1 mRNA observed in wild-type mice after 6 hours of fasting was not seen in KLF15 knockout mice (Figure 3H, 3I, S4A, and S4B). These data were consistent with those from the knockdown experiments.

By contrast, after prolonged fasting (24 hours of fasting), the Srebf1c promoter activities of KLF15 knockout mice were suppressed to the similar levels as those of the wild-type control mice. To clarify the compensatory mechanism in KLF15 knockout mice which finally suppressed SREBP-1c to the same low levels as in wild type under the prolonged (24 hours) fasting condition, we examined the blood profiles of KLF15 knockout mice. Consistent with the previous report (Gray et al., 2007), KLF15 knockout mice showed significantly lower blood glucose (Figure S4C), leading to the marked elevation of plasma glucagon levels (Figure S4D). We found that this in turn activated the hepatic PKA pathway in KLF15 knockout mice (Figure 3J and S4E–S4G), which led to the suppression of LXR/RXR transcriptional activity (Yamamoto et al., 2007).

Consistently, the mRNA and protein abundance of Klf15 and Srebf1 in the liver showed reciprocal changes according to the time course of fasting or re-feeding (Figure 3K–3M). Moreover, the reverse correlation between KLF15 and SREBP-1 was preserved when animals were re-fed with various amount of food (Figure 3N).

To further verify if this suppression by KLF15 actually occurs during the physiological time course, we checked the suppressive effect of KLF15 using the Tet-on system, where the rapid induction of KLF15 is driven by doxycycline (Dox) (Figure S4H–S4K). As shown in Figure 3O–3Q (see also Figure S4K), doxycycline administration quickly suppressed the Srebf1c promoter activity.

From these multiple lines of evidence, we concluded that fasting-induced KLF15 binds to NuRE and suppresses the Srebf1c promoter activity by inhibiting LXR/RXR, and that KLF15 rapidly controls the expression levels of SREBP-1c.

Mechanism of KLF15 and LXR interaction
To elucidate the molecular mechanism of KLF15 suppression against LXR/RXR, the molecular interaction between KLF15 and LXR/RXR was assessed using coimmunoprecipitation experiments. KLF15 and LXR/RXR were shown to form a complex in cultured cell and in vivo liver nuclei (Figure 4A). Notably, the LXR–RXR interaction was not influenced by KLF15 (Figure 4B).

To understand the specificity of this KLF15-LXR/RXR interaction, we investigated the binding of KLF family members, including KLF15 and KLF4, to LXRα and RXRα using GST pull-down assays. Among the KLFs that were tested (KLF1, 4, 5, 9, 10 and 15), only KLF15 and KLF4 bound to LXRα (Figure 4C). Essentially the same results were obtained using mammalian two-hybrid experiments (Figure 4D). RXRα showed a broader specificity for KLF5, KLF9 and KLF10, in addition to KLF15 and KLF4. Taken together with the data that other KLFs such as KLF5, 9 and 10 can bind to the NuRE sequence (Figure S2A and S2B), the specificity of KLF15 and KLF4 on the suppression of Srebf1c promoter activity (Figure 2A) is considered to be attributable to the specific binding of LXR to KLF15 and KLF4. Intriguingly, KLF15 also has an affinity for RARα, and RAR was interchangeable with LXR as a partner for KLF15 (Figure S5A and S5B).

Next we attempted to determine the domain of KLF15 responsible for the interaction with LXRα. KLF15 consists of two domains: an N-terminal repression and activation domains (RAD) and a C-terminal DNA-binding domain (DBD) composed of three zinc-finger domains. 35S-labeled deletion derivatives of KLF15 were subjected to a pull-down assay with GST-LXRα, and the zinc-finger domain of KLF15 was shown to be critical for its interaction with LXRα (Figure 4E). Supporting this finding, a truncated KLF15 lacking the zinc-finger domain had no effect on the inhibition of LXR/RXR activity (Figure 4F). Similarly, to map the domain of LXRα required for this interaction, we performed pull-down assays using GST fusion proteins containing various domains of LXRα, which consists of 4 domains: a ligand-independent activation function domain (A/B), a DNA-binding domain (C), a ligand-binding domain (DE) and a ligand-dependent transactivation function-2 domain (AF2). These pull-down assays revealed that the C domain of LXRα is critical for its interaction with KLF15 (Figure 4G). A comparable result was observed for the RXRα-KLF15 interaction (Figure S5C).

These results demonstrate that KLF15 and LXRα interact with each other through the DNA-binding domain on each molecule. The DNA-binding domains of transcription factors, including nuclear receptors, can also function as an interacting domain with other proteins (Yin et al., 2002). The results of electrophoretic mobility shift assays (Figure S5D) confirmed that KLF15 and LXRα/RXRα actually form a complex on the DNA fragment containing LXRE plus NuRE, whereas the binding of KLF15 or LXRα/RXRα to each corresponding element was not affected by LXRα/RXRα or KLF15, respectively.

KLF15 represses LXR by recruiting RIP140 corepressor
To further explore the detailed mechanism of how KLF15 suppresses LXR/RXR, we attempted to identify additional cofactor(s) that may be operative. Three corepressors, NcoR1, SMRT (NcoR2) and RIP140, can reportedly be coupled with LXRα or β-mediated transcription (Glass et al., 1997; Hu et al., 2003; Jakobsson et al., 2007; Yamamoto et al., 2007). To test the possible involvement of these corepressors in the KLF15-induced inhibition of LXR activity, mammalian two-hybrid assays were performed. This system detects the binding of a VP16-AD-LXRα fusion protein and GAL4-DBD-corepressor-NID (a functional domain that interacts with nuclear receptors) in HEK293 cells (Figure 5A and S5E). Unlike NcoR1 and SMRT, the hybridization between RIP140 and LXRα was enhanced by KLF15, indicating that KLF15 promotes the recruitment of the RIP140 corepressor to LXRα. This result was confirmed by immunoprecipitation experiments (Figure 5B). In particular, the amount of LXR-RIP140 complex was much more abundant in the presence of KLF15 in wild-type mice compared with KLF15 knockout mice although LXR and RIP140 themselves were present at the similar levels in both models of mice (Figure S5F).

We also checked the possible involvement of a major coactivator coupled with LXR, steroid receptor coactivator-1 (SRC1) (Huuskonen et al., 2004); KLF15 specifically decreased the recruitment of SRC1 to LXRα (Figure 5C), while KLF family members other than KLF15 did not (Figure S5G).

Next we examined the physiological changes in the amount of LXR-RIP140 and LXR-SRC1 complexes during fasting and re-feeding in an in vivo setting. When liver nuclear extracts were immunoprecipitated with anti-LXRα/β antibody and co-precipitated RIP140 and SRC1 were visualized using western blotting, a larger amount of LXR-RIP140 complex was found in the fasting state (Figure 5D). In contrast, SRC1 coupled with LXR was reciprocally decreased in the fasting state, suggesting that RIP140 recruitment assisted by KLF15 competes with SRC1 binding to LXR and thus inhibits the transcriptional activity. A chromatin immunoprecipitation assay using the RIP140 and SRC1 antibody also exhibited reciprocal patterns between RIP140 and SRC1 (Figure 5E). When we tested if RIP140 and SRC1 compete against each other when binding to LXRα using a GST pull-down assay, RIP140 inhibited SRC1 binding to LXRα and vice versa (Figure 5F). The knockdown of RIP140 caused a marked elevation in Srebf1c promoter activity and consequently, Srebf1 gene expression in the fasting state (Figure 5G and 5H), but not in the fed state (Figure S5H), consistent with the previous report (Berriel Diaz et al., 2008). Moreover, RIP140 deficiency completely cancelled the effect of KLF15 knockdown on Srebf1c expression in the fasting state (Figure S5I), indicating that the effect of KLF15 on Srebf1c expression is completely dependent on RIP140.

From these results, we concluded that KLF15 suppresses LXR by recruiting a RIP140 corepressor instead of an SRC1 coactivator.

KLF15 ameliorates hypertriglyceridemia
To explore the possible involvement of KLF15 in the pathogenesis of obesity-related metabolic disorders, we examined the role of KLF15 in the hypertriglyceridemia observed in genetically obese ob/ob mice. As shown in Figure 6A (and also in Figure S6A and S6B), the expression level of KLF15 was significantly lower in ob/ob mouse liver compared with control. Forced restoration of KLF15 levels in ob/ob mice to the wild-type levels attenuated Srebf1 overexpression and let to an improvement of hypertriglyceridemia (Figure 6B, 6C, and S6C–S6E), without elevating blood glucose (Figure 6D).

As another animal model of hypertriglyceridemia, we tested the effect of KLF15 activation on the mice administered a synthetic LXR ligand T0901317. Administration of T0901317 induced hepatic SREBP-1c and caused hypertriglyceridemia. When Ad-KLF15 adenovirus was transduced in the livers of T0901317-treated mice, the Srebf1 mRNA expression was completely repressed to the level of vehicle-treated control (Figure 6E, S6F, and S6G), resulting in a decrease in Fasn mRNA and a concomitant decrease in plasma triglyceride levels without affecting HDL cholesterol levels (Figure 6F–6H). These results suggest that KLF15 is involved in the pathogenesis of obesity-related dyslipidemia and can be a therapeutic target for the treatment.

DISCUSSION
SREBP-1c is regulated at the transcription level depending upon nutritional states especially at fasting/refeeding cycle. Although the Srebf1c promoter is controlled by LXR, the precise molecular mechanism has been largely unknown by which SREBP-1c expression is nutritionally regulated. The current study clearly demonstrated using the new approaches of nutrigenomics that fasting-induced KLF15 forms a complex with LXR/RXR on the Srebf1c promoter to repress the expressions of SREBP-1c and downstream lipogenic genes during the early and euglycemic phase of fasting (Figure 7). Conversely, in the postprandial state, KLF15 levels decrease and the suppressive complex of KLF15-LXR/RXR-RIP140 was replaced by LXR/RXR-SRC1, leading to the activation of Srebf1c promoter.

It is well known that LXR can be activated by ligands (Forman et al., 1997; Janowski et al., 1996; Lehmann et al., 1997), and that diet-derived LXR ligands might be the key inducer of SREBP-1 and lipogenic gene expression before we started this study. However, in our series of in vivo Ad-luc experiments elucidating the regulatory mechanism of LXR, we found out that the LXR-binding cis-elements alone were not sufficient for the fasting-refeeding regulation, although they exhibited a complete response to an LXR ligand as shown in Figure 1B. This finding clearly showed that the fasting-refeeding regulation of SREBP-1c transcription is not brought about by changes in the LXR ligand concentration. In accordance with this, LXR downstream genes such as ABCA1, ABCG5 and ABCG8 in the liver are reported to show no response to refeeding (Oosterveer et al., 2008). It is also notable that another nuclear receptor RAR, instead of LXR, can function as a partner for KLF15 in this context (Figure S5A and S5B). From these lines of evidence, we concluded that LXR ligands are not involved in the fasting-refeeding response of lipogenic genes in the liver.

KLF15 is upregulated in fasting mouse liver and is known to contribute to the regulation of hepatic gluconeogenesis (Gray et al., 2007; Teshigawara et al., 2005). In light of the current work, we propose that the regulation of lipogenesis and gluconeogenesis is coordinated by KLF15 and is reciprocally regulated in response to nutritional conditions. Given that lipogenesis is an adaptive process that facilitates survival during subsequent starvation, it is conceivable that the key factor or factors controlling lipogenesis are negatively regulated by these fasting-induced factors.

In our previous publication, we reported that the PKA phosphorylation of LXR suppresses Srebf1c transcription by recruiting a co-repressor NcoR1 (Yamamoto et al., 2007). To clarify the relationship between KLF15-mediated and PKA-mediated Srebf1c repression, we analyzed KLF15 knockout mice (Gray et al., 2007). As shown in Figure 3G, KLF15 knockout mice exhibited significantly higher activities of Srebf1c promoter at an early stage of fasting (6 hours of fasting). In contrast, after prolonged fasting (24 hours of fasting), the Srebf1c promoter activities of KLF15 knockout mice were suppressed to the similar levels as those of the wild-type control mice. Series of experiments revealed that the compensatory mechanism in KLF15 knockout mice which finally suppressed Srebf1c expression to the same low levels as in wild type after the prolonged fasting was the hypoglycemia-induced PKA activation which caused the suppression of LXR/RXR transcriptional activity depending on NcoR1 co-repressor (Figure 3J, S4C–S4E, and S7A–S7E). Supporting this, NcoR1 binding to Srebf1c promoter as assessed by ChIP assay was elevated in KLF15 knockout mice (Figure S7C). Interestingly, the PKA-mediated phosphorylation of LXR did not affect RIP140 binding to LXR (Figure S5E), demonstrating that KLF15-RIP140-mediated and PKA-NcoR1-mediated SREBP-1c repression is independent.

This pathway from hypoglycemic PKA stimulation to LXR suppression via NcoR1 is usually activated in the prolonged fasting state, whereas the KLF15-mediated lipogenic suppression is seen from the early and euglycemic period. It is conceivable that this earlier shutdown of lipogenesis through the KLF15 pathway may help quicker restart of triglyceride synthesis after refeeding observed in wild-type mice compared with KLF15 knockout mice (Figure S7F). Together with the other important role of KLF15 in gluconeogenesis, the KLF15-mediated pathway can be considered as an adaptive and homeostatic mechanism of energy metabolism working from the euglycemic phase of fasting before hypoglycemia and PKA activation proceeds.

Previously, a detailed mutation analysis of SREBP-1c promoter activity in primary hepatocytes was reported (Chen et al., 2004), where they found no derepression of promoter activity around the NuRE region. Whereas our analyses were based on the intra-organ assays using living animals, they used cultured primary hepatocytes as the experimental materials, which might cause this discrepancy. In fact, the expression of KLF15 severely diminishes quickly after the preparation of primary hepatocytes (data not shown), demonstrating the differences between in vivo and in vitro settings. It is probable that our strategy of starting from intra-organ assays to screen the cis-elements enabled us to successfully identify the KLF15-mediated pathway.

Regarding the upstream regulatory mechanisms by which KLF15 is induced during fasting, the possible involvement of insulin was examined (Figure S7G). We found that STZ - induced insulin deficiency partially increased KLF15 while it decreased SREBP-1c, suggesting some molecular link between insulin and KLF15. At the same time, it has been reported that other hormones beyond insulin are involved in the regulation of KLF15 expression (Teshigawara et al., 2005). These findings are consistent with the previous report analyzing liver-specific insulin receptor knockout (LIRKO) mice (Haas et al., 2012), which revealed that though insulin signaling is necessary for maximal induction, nutrients -either directly, or indirectly, via hormones other than insulin - are sufficient for the induction of the SREBP-1c and lipogenic gene transcripts.

In the present study, we used our original library of transcription factors named TFEL (Transcription Factor Expression Library) (Yahagi and Takeuchi, 2016), which covers nearly all the known transcription factors encoded by the mouse genome, to identify the transcription factor binding to NuRE in the presence of LXR/RXR. It is well known that binding site prediction based on binding motif databases suffers from high false-positive and false-negative rates in general (Kim and Park, 2010). In particular, the sequence-based approach has no power to predict transcription factor complexes formed by protein-protein interaction.

Conversely, the search for protein-protein interactions among transcription factors alone may not be sufficient to elucidate the regulatory complexes in certain situations including the present case, because complexes like KLF15-LXR/RXR also depend on the cis-elements i.e. NuRE plus LXRE in this case. This relatively weak interaction supported by the DNA backbone enables gene-specific regulations and may possibly give more diversity to transcriptional networks. Thus, our combinatorial strategy of searching for a functional cis-element and screening for the corresponding transcription factor complex in a context-dependent manner can be a very effective and powerful approach for exploring sophisticated transcriptional networks in detail.

Synthetic LXR ligands have been expected to have atheroprotective effects through the promotion of reverse cholesterol transport and inhibition of intestinal cholesterol absorption (Joseph et al., 2002). However, the unfavorable side effect of elevating plasma triglyceride level has hampered the therapeutic application of LXR ligands. Our finding that KLF15 can specifically block the lipogenic effect of an LXR ligand provides therapeutic implications for the treatment of dyslipidemia in obesity-related diseases with SREBP-1c overexpression. Moreover, it is notable that KLF15 overexpression in mouse liver, in contrast to primary cultured hepatocytes whose expression levels of KLF15 and gluconeogenic genes are very low (data not shown), does not lead to an excess gluconeogenesis (Figure 6D, S3F, S6D, and Table S1). Thus, KLF15 overexpression can improve plasma lipid profile without exacerbating hyperglycemia. Elucidating the upstream mechanisms of KLF15 regulation will be also important from this therapeutic point of view.

Six to eight week old ICR male mice were purchased from CLEA (Tokyo, Japan). Six to seven week old ob/ob male mice were purchased from SLC (Shizuoka, Japan). KLF15 knockout mice were gifted from Prof. Jain MK and genotyped as previously described (Fisch et al., 2007) and wild-type littermates were used as controls. All animals were maintained in a temperature-controlled environment with a 12-h-light/dark cycle and were given free access to standard laboratory diet and water. For the fasting group, animals were starved 24 h, and for the refeeding group, they were re-fed for 16 h after a 24-h starvation. For the experiments of ob/ob mice, animals were starved 18 h. For LXR ligand experiments of hepatic luciferase activity, T0901317 was administered at the dose of 50 mg/kg after a 24-h starvation and analyzed 16 h later. For the experiments of insulin-depleted diabetic mice, ICR male mice were administrated with streptozotocin (two intraperitoneal injections of 100 mg/kg body weight with 1-day interval) as previously described (Takeuchi et al., 2007). Mice were sacrificed in the early light phase in a fasted, re-fed or nonfasted (ad libitum) state. All animals studied were anesthetized and euthanized according to the protocol approved by the Tsukuba University Animal Care and Use Committee. All experiments were repeated at least twice.

Preparation of recombinant adenoviruses
Recombinant adenoviruses were constructed using Gateway system (Invitrogen). Details are described in SUPPLEMENTAL EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURES.

In vivo imaging of luciferase activity
In vivo imaging was performed as described previously (Takeuchi et al., 2010). Three to six days after the adenovirus transduction, D-Luciferin potassium salt (Wako, Tokyo, Japan) was injected i.p. into mice and the luminescence in the liver was captured using an IVIS™ Imaging System (Xenogen). Relative photon emission over the liver region was quantified using LivingImage™ software (Xenogen). When hepatic transduction efficiency was determined, the quantification of adenoviral DNA in the liver was performed using Q-RT PCR method as described previously (Takeuchi et al., 2007), and the result of quantification was used to normalize the in vivo imaging of luciferase activity. Otherwise, the two paired data from the same animal on the different nutritional conditions (i.e., fasted or refed) were continuously obtained and the ratio between the two quantities was used to cancel the variations in hepatic transduction efficiencies.

Genome-wide transcription factor screening
The transcription factor expression library (TFEL) clones (Yahagi and Takeuchi, 2016) were cotransfected with the Srebf1c-(LXREx2+NuRE)-SV40p-Luc plasmid together with LXRα/RXRα expression plasmids into HEK293 cells. The luciferase activity in transfectants was then measured using a luminometer with a standard assay kit (Promega).

Electrophoretic mobility shift assay (EMSA)
Electrophoretic mobility shift assay (EMSA) was performed as described previously (Amemiya-Kudo et al., 2000). Details are documented in SUPPLEMENTAL EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURES.

Chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) assay
Separation of hepatic nuclei from mouse liver and ChIP assays were performed as described previously (Ide et al., 2004) (Nakagawa et al., 2006). Chromatin DNA was further purified with Wizard DNA Clean-Up System (Promega) and used as a template for PCR. Primers used to amplify Srebf1c promoter or SRE (Sterol Regulatory Element) in Fasn promoter regions and reaction conditions were described previously (Sekiya et al., 2007; Yamamoto et al., 2007). As a positive control, 1% of the input genomic DNA was used.

RNA isolation and Northern blotting
Total RNA preparation and blot hybridization with cDNA probes were performed as previously described (Takeuchi et al., 2010). Full-length cDNAs were used for cDNA probes for mouse Klf15 and Klf4. cDNA probe for mouse Hpd was prepared by RT PCR using mouse liver total RNA as a template. The primers were as follows: 5′ - CATTTCCACTCGGTGACCT- 3′ and 5′ - TGTCTTGCTCCACCCATG-3′. Rplp0 was used as a loading control. Blots were exposed to BAS imaging plate for the BAS2000 BIO Imaging Analyzer (Fuji Photo Film).

Quantitative reverse transcription PCR (Q-RT PCR)
Total RNA (2 μg) was reverse-transcribed using the High Capacity cDNA reverse transcription kit (Applied Biosystems). Q-RT PCR was performed using SYBR Green Dye (Kapa Biosystems) on a 7300 Real Time PCR system (Applied Biosystems). The primer sets are listed in Table S2.

Immunoblotting and immunoprecipitation
Immunoblotting and immunoprecipitation were performed as described previously (Takeuchi et al., 2010; Yamamoto et al., 2007). Nuclear extract protein from mouse liver and HEK293 cells was prepared as previously described (Sheng et al., 1995; Yahagi et al., 2003; Yahagi et al., 2004).

Construction of Tet-on system
Tet-on system to rapidly activate KLF15 expression was constructed as described previously (Urlinger et al., 2000). A modified rtetR fragment was amplified by PCR from pUHD172-1 (Gossen et al., 1995). Tet response element (TRE) was cloned from pSIREN-RetroQ-TetP (Clontech). Details are described in SUPPLEMENTAL EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURES.

GST pull-down assay
GST and GST fusion proteins were prepared as described previously (Najima et al., 2005) and dialyzed with dialysis buffer (50 mM Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 50 mM NaCl, 1mM EDTA, 1mM DTT). [35S]Methionine-labeled proteins were prepared using TNT T7 quick coupled transcription/translation system (Promega). GST pull-down assays were performed as described previously (Najima et al., 2005; Yamamoto et al., 2007).

Mammalian two-hybrid assay
HEK293 cells were cotransfected with GAL4-RE-Luc plasmids, expression plasmids for GAL4 fusion protein and for VP16 fusion protein.

Statistical analyses
Data are expressed as means ± s.e.m. Differences between two groups were assessed using the unpaired two-tailed Student’s t-test. Data sets involving more than two groups were assessed by ANOVA with Statview Software (BrainPower). The differences were considered to be significant if P &lt; 0.05.

Figure 7 KLF15 enables rapid switching between lipogenesis and gluconeogenesis
Schematic presentation of molecular mechanism by which KLF15 switches lipogenesis and gluconeogenesis.

See also Figure S7.

Highlights
A transcription factor library screen reveals a complex between KLF15/LXR/RXR.

KLF15 interacts with LXR/RXR and recruits the RIP140 corepressor to the Srebf1c promoter.

This enables rapid switching between lipogenesis and gluconeogenesis during fasting.

Hepatic KLF15 augmentation improves plasma lipid profile.
