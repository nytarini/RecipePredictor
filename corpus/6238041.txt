 meat products has become a big interest
in last decades. Several molecular approaches have been developed to investigate the
composition of microbiota in fermented food. The 16S rRNA gene sequencing was
frequently used for identifying bacteria in fermented sausages (Blaiotta et al., 2003; Rantsiou et al., 2005; Sanz et
al., 1998). Rantsiou and Cocolin
(2006) investigated the microbial dynamics in fermented sausage using 16S
rRNA gene sequencing during cooking and reported that different genera, species and
even strains of bacteria significantly affected its sensory properties. The
culture-dependent (agar plating) and culture-independent (direct DNA analysis)
combination methods were used to investigate microbial ecology of traditional
Italian salami (Silvestri et al., 2007).
Lactic acid bacteria (LAB) are the main bacteria found in most fermented meat
products. Lactobacillus plantarum, Lactobacillus
sakei and Lactobacillus curvatus have been most
frequently found species within LAB group. LAB can grow rapidly utilizing
carbohydrates in the media where they live and produce lactic acid that lowering pH
of the media, even so they also have ability to regulate their cytoplasmic pH to be
homeostasis (Cocolin et al., 2001; Hutkins and Nannen, 1993; Leroy et al., 2006). As LAB grow during fermentation, the
environment and the composition of indigenous microbiota in traditional dry sausages
would be change (Talon et al., 2007b).
However, the amount of research investigating the changes in composition of
microbiota in fermented sausage made from poultry meat using next-generation of
microbial community analysis is still limited.
      Fermented meat products such as summer sausage and pepperoni can be found in most
parts of the world, even though it is largely produced and consumed in Southern and
Central European countries (Campbell-Platt and Cook,
1995). Because meat is one of perishable food, the preservation methods
have long been developed. Fermentation and drying have been known as the oldest
preservation methods. Fermented sausages are made from cured meat batter, fermented
and dried under controlled temperature and relative humidity (RH) conditions in
order to extend its shelf life (Leroy et al.,
2006; Talon et al., 2007a).
      Most fermented sausages are made from pork or beef and mixed with spices. Ground-type
meat products are suitable for effective utilization of tough meat obtained from
spent layers (Kondaiah and Panda, 1992).
However, the availability of fermented poultry based products is still limited in
the market concerning the risk of food borne disease caused by
Salmonella contamination. To combat the presence of pathogens,
sausage can be fermented with selected strain of lactic acid producing bacteria,
cooked and dried. These bacteria play role not only to preserve the sausage by
increasing its acidity level but also to enhance flavor, aroma and texture through
enzymatic processes (Caplice and Fitzgerald,
1999; Urso et al., 2006).
Furthermore, the use of natural ingredients that could inhibit the growth of
pathogens is required. Chopi (Zanthoxylum piperitum) is one of
spices that is available in East Asia and used traditionally as herbal medicine. The
essential oil and methanolic extract of chopi have been confirmed having
antimicrobial and antioxidant activity against some food pathogens and lipid
oxidation in meat homogenate (Choi et al.,
2008; Park et al., 2008; Tanabe et al., 2002; Yamazaki et al., 2007). Therefore, the objective of this study
was to observe the effect of ground chopi addition on the changes in physicochemical
traits and composition of microbiota during different manufacturing stages based on
their molecular profiles, using high-throughput sequencing on Illumina MiSeq.

      Materials and Methods

        Sausages manufacturing and sampling procedure
        Frozen deboned skinless thighs from 70-week-old spent layer (Hy-Line) were thawed
overnight at 2&#xB1;2&#xB0;C and cold ground twice through 10-mm plate using
a meat grinder (PC-6 5-F, Sung Chang Co., Ltd., Korea). Thigh meat was chosen
considering its high myoglobin content compared with breast meat and the
addition level (%) of other ingredients was based on weight of the ingredient to
weight of ground meat (w/w). Ground thigh meat was mixed for 5 min using a
HeavyDuty 5KPM50 mixer (KitchenAid, USA) with salt (2.3% w/w), sodium
erythorbate (0.05% w/w), dextrose (0.75% w/w), sucrose (1% w/w), ground black
pepper (0.7% w/w), all spices (0.77% w/w), carrageenan (1.0% w/w), hickory
liquid smoke (0.1% w/w), and curing salt (0.3% w/w) consisting of sodium
chloride (93.1%), sodium nitrite (5.9%) and sodium carbonate (1.0%).
Freeze-dried starter culture (0.2% w/w) consisted of Staphylococcus
carnosus, Staphylococcus xylosus,
Lactobacillus curvatus and Lactobacillus
sakei (Lyocarni VBL-97, Sacco System, Italy) was rehydrated in
distilled water (1:1 w/v) prior to mix with the batter. Ground dried-chopi fruit
(Zanthoxylum piperitum) purchased from local market was
added at different levels; 0% (control), 0.1%, 0.3% and 0.5% (w/w) and mixed for
another 5 min. The sausage batter was stuffed (20-cm long/sausage link) into
60-mm (&#xD8;) cellulose casing (Teepak Co., USA) and was hanged and processed
in a chamber (VC 2057, Votsch Industruetechnik, Germany) with controlled
temperature and relative humidity (RH). Sausages were fermented until reaching
pH of 5.0 at 35&#xB0;C/RH 73% for 15 h, stepwise cooked at 54&#xB0;C/RH 27%
for 1 h, 63&#xB0;C/RH 31% for 1.5 h, 74&#xB0;C/RH 17% for 1.5 h,
77&#xB0;C/RH 15% for 3 h, 77&#xB0;C/RH 31% for 5 min and cooled down at
10&#xB0;C/RH 80% for 1 h totaling 8 hours for this stage. The cooked sausages
were dried for 7 d. The 7-d of drying process was started at 10&#xB0;C/RH 80%
for 48 h, 10&#xB0;C/RH 75% for 48 h and 10&#xB0;C/RH 70% for 72 h. Sampling
(n=3) for physicochemical and microbiological analyses was performed at the
beginning of the manufacture (raw batter), the end of fermentation, cooking
(after cooling down) and drying.

        Physicochemical properties analysis
        The sample (5 g) and distilled water (45 mL) were homogenized (PH91, SMT Co.,
Ltd., Japan) at 10,000 rpm for 1 min and the mixture was used for pH
determination. Changes in pH were recorded in triplicate on each manufacture
stage (raw, fermentation, maturation and drying) using a pH meter (SevenEasy pH,
Mettler-Toledo GmbH, Switzerland) calibrated with acid (pH 4.01), neutral (pH
7.00) and alkali (pH 9.21) technical buffer solutions (Seven Easy pH,
Mettler-Toledo GmbH, Switzerland) at 22&#xB0;C according to
manufacturer&#x2019;s instruction. Water activity was measured with aquaspector
(AQS-2, Nagy, Germany) in triplicate for each 5 g of samples.
        The instrumental color was recorded in five repetitions by measuring
International Commission on Illumination&#x2019;s system for lightness (CIE L*),
redness (CIE a*) and yellowness (CIE b*) using a chromameter (CR-400, Konica
Minolta Inc., Japan). The light source of illuminant C (2&#xB0; observer) with
8 mm aperture and attached-closed cone was calibrated using a white plate
(Y=93.6, X=0.3134, y=0.3194).
        Lipid oxidation was analyzed using the 2-thiobarbituric acid reactive substances
(TBARS) method by Sinnhuber and Yu (1977)
with slight modification. A total of 0.5 g of sample was prepared in triplicate
and vortex-mixed with 0.1 g of antioxidant mixture (consisting of 54% propylene
glycol, 40% Tween 20, 3% butylated hydroxytoluene, and 3% butylated
hydroxyanisole), 3 mL of 1% TBA (thiobarbituric acid) in 0.3% NaOH, and 17 mL of
2.5% trichloroacetic acid in 36 mM HCl (Sigma-Aldrich Corp., LLC., USA). The
sample was heated in a water bath (BW-20G, Biotechnical Services, Inc., USA) at
100&#xB0;C for 30 min and then immersed in ice water for 15 min. Subsequently,
5 mL of aqueous sample was mixed with 3 mL of chloroform (Daejung Chemical and
Metals Co. Ltd., Korea) to remove the dirt. The absorbance value of the upper
layer was recorded at 532 nm (UV Mini 1240 PC, Shimadzu Corp., Japan) against
blank after centrifuging at 2,400 g for 30 min at 4&#xB0;C (1248R, Labogene,
Denmark). The result was expressed in mg of malondialdehyde (MDA) per kg of
sample.

        Bacterial counts
        For bacterial counts, 1 g of sample was put in a sterile bag and prepared in
triplicate (Whirl-Pak, Nasco, USA). Sample was homogenized with 9 mL of
sterilized 0.1% peptone in distilled water for 2 min using a stomacher (400,
Seward Ltd., UK). Decimal dilutions were prepared using sterilized 0.1% peptone
water. Total viable counts (TVC), LAB and coliform were enumerated using plate
count agar, De Man, Rogosa and Sharpe agar and violet red bile agar,
respectively (Difco, Becton, Dickinson and Company, USA). The LAB plates were
incubated in anaerobic chambers with anaerobic atmosphere generation bags
(Sigma-Aldrich Corp., LLC., USA). For TVC, the plates were incubated at
37&#xB0;C for 48 h. While, both coliform and LAB plates were incubated at
35&#xB0;C for 24 to 48 h. Microbial population was counted and expressed as
log CFU/g.

        DNA extraction and 16S rRNA gene sequencing
        Sausage samples were processed for DNA extraction. NucleoSpin Soil kit (MN,
D&#xFC;ren, Germany) was used to extract genomic DNA of microorganisms in the
samples. PCR was conducted to amplify 16S rRNA gene using barcoded primers
targeting V4 region. The primers have the following sequences, respectively:
5'-GGACTACHVGGGTWTCTAAT-3 and 5'-GGACTACHVGGGTWTCTAAT-3'. PCR reaction solution
contained genomic DNA (5 ng), reaction buffer (25 mM Mg2+), dNTP (200
&#x3BC;M each), Ex taq (0.75 unit, Takara, South Korea), and barcoded primers
(5 pmole each). PCR reaction was carried out as follows; 94&#xB0;C for 3 min
for the initial denaturation, 30 cycles of 45 s at 94&#xB0;C, 1 min at
55&#xB0;C and 90 s at 72&#xB0;C for amplification, and 72&#xB0;C for 10
min for the final extension. The same amount of each PCR amplicon was pooled,
and the pooled amplicons were subjected to library construction for Illumina
MiSeq sequencing using NEBNext&#xAE; UltraTM DNA Library
Prep Kit (NEB, Cat. E7370S). The library was sequenced for paired-end 250-bp
reads in the Illumina MiSeq.

        Microbial community and statistical analysis
        Raw MiSeq reads were processed to be demultiplexed and trimmed by in-house perl
scripts. The processed paired reads were concatenated, and the concatenated
reads were applied to quantitative insights into microbial ecology (QIIME) for
microbial analysis version 1.9.1 (Caporaso et
al., 2010). Greengenes database (gg_ptus-13_8-release version, 97%
nucleotide identity) was used to assign each concatenated read to operational
taxonomic unit (OTU) (DeSantis et al.,
2006). The &#x3B1;- and &#x3B2;-diversity, the cluster pattern and
summarized taxonomy of each sample were analyzed using the QIIME pipeline after
OTU assignment. Principal coordinate analysis (PCoA) was performed based on
unweighted and weighted UniFrac distances. The data of physicochemical
properties and bacterial counts were subjected to two-way analysis of variance
(ANOVA). Chopi addition level (control, 0.1%, 0.3%, and 0.5%) and manufacture
stage (raw, fermentation, cooking, drying) were used as factors. Interaction
effects were found in observed variables except water activity (only different
manufacture stage effect was found). Therefore, the means of treatment groups
were then separated using Duncan&#x2019;s multiple range test (p&lt;0.05)
according to chopi level and manufacture stage with SAS 9.1 (SAS Institute Inc.,
USA).

      Results and Discussion

        pH and water activity
        The declines in pH and water activity of the chicken summer sausage during
manufacture are shown in Table 1. The
effect of ground chopi addition on pH was observed after cooking and drying
stages. However, the addition of ground chopi did not influence water activity
of the sausage during manufacture. Samples added with ground chopi had lower pH
than control after cooking and drying stages, while no differences were found at
the beginning of the manufacture and after fermentation. The initial change of
pH started during fermentation. The pH dropped about 1.50 to 1.56 unit, reached
the lowest value (4.83&#x2013;4.91) after cooking, and no significant changes
were observed until 7 d of drying. Drying for 7 d lowered not only the pH but
also water activity of the sausage significantly. The water activity values
showed slow decreases. The final product obtained after drying had the lowest
water activity of 0.91, regardless of chopi addition level.

        Changes in pH and water activity are two basic elements in fermented sausage
manufacturing. The accumulation of lactic acid from carbohydrate metabolism by
lactic acid bacteria during fermentation and the length of drying time determine
the decline trend of pH value and water activity. Deumier and Collignan (2003) reported that the final pH of
dry chicken summer sausage was about 4.97, while the water activity of 0.82 was
recorded on day 24 of drying. These mean that our samples should be dried longer
to achieve water activity below 0.90.

        Instrumental color and lipid oxidation
        The instrumental color of the sausage changed during manufacture and the addition
of ground chopi at 0.3% and 0.5% slowed down (p&lt;0.05) the redness
development (Table 1). Fermentation
process increased CIE L* value (p&lt;0.05) in all experimental groups and
the value decreased signifiantly after cooking. The CIE a* value of all groups
was significantly higher than that of raw samples after fermentation. The final
products of the control and 0.1% chopi group had significantly higher CIE a*
value than those of 0.3% and 0.5% group. The addition of ground chopi into raw
sausage batter reduced yellowness (p&lt;0.05) as it also reduced the
lightness (p&lt;0.05). However, no significant differences were found on
yellowness between control and added chopi groups after fermentation and so
forth because the CIE b* value of added chopi groups increased (p&lt;0.05)
and being close to that of control. The dark appearance of the ground
dried-chopi might reduce the lightness and yellowness of the raw sausage batter.
Further, the development of redness during manufacture and the manufacture
process itself could influence the lightness and yellowness of the final
products.
        The development of redness in fermented cured meat products is merely caused by
the use of nitrate/nitrite salts. Under acid condition, the microorganism
activates nitrate/nitrite reductase resulting in the generation of nitric oxide
(NO). NOs bind to the heme pigment of myoglobin and the NO-heme pigment
complexes result in the red appearance of the cured meat (Pegg and Honikel, 2014). In this study, lower CIE a* value
found in the sausages added with ground chopi during manufacture could be caused
by the antimicrobial activity of the ground chopi itself. The essential oil of
Zanthoxylum piperitum possesses inhibitory activity against
food borne pathogens and oral Streptococcus mutans (Choi et al., 2008; Park et al., 2008). Therefore, the number of
nitrate/nitrite reductase-positive bacteria might be affected by ground chopi
and less NO was produced than control.
        Changes in TBARS value of the sausage during manufacture were also affected by
the addition of ground chopi (Table 1).
TBARS value increased (p&lt;0.05) during manufacture in all groups. However,
the final products containing ground chopi had lower TBARS value than that of
control. Yamazaki et al. (2007) reported
that the methanolic extract of Zanthoxylum piperitum fruit had
an antioxidant activity equal to that of &#x3B1;-tocopherol with hyperoside
(quercitin-3-O-galactoside) and quercitrin
(quercitin-3-O-rhamnoside) as the main compounds. Moreover,
hyperoside and quercitrin prevented cell damage induced by oxidation in
vitro and in vivo (Babujanarthanam et al., 2011; Piao
et al., 2008). The antioxidative effect of Zanthoxylum
piperitum pepper in pork homogenate against lipid oxidation has
also been proved in previous study (Tanabe et
al., 2002). Present study confirms that the addition of ground chopi
slow down lipid oxidation in chicken summer sausage during manufacture. Among
chopi groups, addition level of 0.3% and 0.5% (w/w) resulted in lower TBARS
value in the final product than the others.

        Bacterial counts
        Total viable count, lactic acid bacteria and coliform population were influenced
by different manufacture stages and addition level of ground chopi (Table 2). Total viable count, lactic acid
bacteria and coliform population reduced significantly at the end of
manufacture. However, only lactic acid bacteria grew (p&lt;0.05) during
fermentation, thus the population of lactic acid bacteria outnumbered total
viable count (aerobic bacteria) at the end of fermentation. Even so, the
population of lactic acid bacteria started declining after cooking and further
until the end of drying. The addition of ground chopi significantly reduced
total viable count after fermentation and further until the end of drying. The
population of lactic acid bacteria was only affected at the beginning of
manufacture, fermentation and cooking, while no significant differences were
found after drying. Similar declining trend was also found in the population of
coliform as affected by ground chopi. The addition of ground chopi at 0.5%
reduced (p&lt;0.05) the population of coliform more than lower addition
levels after cooking. At the end of drying, no differences were found between
the addition level of 0.3% and 0.5% on total coliform. Park et al. (2008) reported that the essential oil
extracted from chopi exhibited antimicrobial activity against Bacillus
cereus, Staphylococcus aureus, Salmonella
cholerawsuis, and Vibrio parahaemolyticus with
limonene as the major compound. The antimicrobial activity of limonene has been
confirmed in model bacteria membranes through membrane fluidization (H&#x105;c-Wydro et al., 2017).

        Microbial species richness
        The reduction of &#x3B1;-diversity (species richness) of the chicken summer
sausage during manufacture is shown in Fig.
1. The rarefaction curves (Fig.
1A) peaked at 5,000 sequences per sample highlighting that an
adequate sequencing depth and observed species (OTUs) discovery was achieved or
suggesting that the majority of bacterial phylotypes present in samples were
successfully identified. Significant differences in averaged OTUs from 0 to
10,000 sequencing reads were found between raw and further stages (Fig. 1B). However, no differences were found
after fermentation and further until the end of manufacture. The significant
effect of ground chopi was found at the beginning of manufacture and during
fermentation. The addition of ground chopi reduced species richness in raw and
fermented stages.

units, i.e., the observed number of bacteria. a,b
Mean&#xB1;SD with different superscripts in same manufacture stage
differ significantly (p&lt;0.05). A,B Mean&#xB1;SD with
different superscripts in same chopi addition level differ significantly
(p&lt;0.05).

        The changes in environmental conditions of the sausage during manufacturing led
the decreases of species richness. Anaerobic and low pH conditions in
fermentation stage were fit only for some groups of bacteria to grow such as
lactic acid-producing bacteria. These bacteria are predominant in most of
fermented food because of their ability to live in low level of oxygen
environment, metabolize carbohydrates to be lactic acid, maintain their inner
cell pH and produce a biological weapon against their opponent called
bacteriocin. The other bacteria might be not suitable with those conditions
(Cocolin et al., 2001; Hutkins and Nannen, 1993; Leroy et al., 2006). Therefore,
fermentation lowered the species richness of fermented sausage. The pH of the
sausage reflected the species richness and predicted the composition of
microorganism during manufacture. The species richness is dependent on the level
of pH due to the excessive growth of lactic acid bacteria. These findings are in
accordance with Fontana et al. (2005),
Park et al. (2012) and Roh et al. (2010). Moreover, this study
confirms the antibacterial effect of ground chopi in chicken summer sausage
during fermentation process, however, with unclear effect further until the end
of drying process because cooking might also diminish the presence some
bacteria.

        Microbial community composition
        In this study, culture-independent method was used to analyze the microbial
community profiles of fermented sausage made from spent layer meat. Classic agar
plating, PCR and denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis were frequently used
for microbial analysis of fermented sausages in previous studies with
93%&#x2013;100% sequence similarity cut-off value (Aquilanti et al., 2007; Cocolin et al., 2001; Janssens et
al., 2012; Silvestri et al.,
2007). However, DNA sequencing on Illumina MiSeq costs cheaper with
high-throughput results (Caporaso et al.,
2012).
        The 16s rRNA gene sequencing was used to determine the phylogenetic
classification of microbial community in chicken summer sausage taken from each
manufacturing stage. The changes in composition of microbiota at phylum and
genus level during manufacture are shown in Figs.
2A and B, respectively. Although
ground chopi significantly reduced the number of total viable count and coliform
after fermentation, the effect of ground chopi addition was not clear on the
proportion of microbiota as it was also not clear on species richness. The three
major (&gt;1%) phylum were identified; Bacteroidetes,
Firmicutes and Proteobacteria, using QIIME
pipeline. In raw samples, Proteobacteria was dominant among
other major phylum with proportion more than 60%, followed by
Firmicutes (20%&#x2013;25%) and
Bacteriodetes (&lt;10%). However, only
Firmicutes increased significantly after fermentation and
peaked at drying stage, dominating almost 90% of total identified microbiota at
both cooking and drying stages. After fermentation and so forth,
Bacteriodetes and Proteobacteria
population decreased sharply. At genus level, lactic acid bacteria was the
predominant group of bacteria after fermentation and so forth, highlighted by a
significant escalation of unclassified Lactobacillales and
Lactobacillus. The proportion of other lactic acid bacteria
such as Enterococcus, Leuconostoc,
Lactococcus, Pediococcus,
Streptococcus and Weisella did not change
significantly during manufacture. The proportion of
Acinetobacter, Prevotella,
Pseudomonas and Unclassified
Enterobactericeae reduced significantly after fermentation
and so forth. Although Staphylococcus was not a predominant
genus found during manufacture, its proportion increased during fermentation.
However, cooking and drying lowered the proportion of
Staphylococcus significantly. Janssens et al. (2013) reported that coagulase-negative
staphylococci, for instance Staphylococcus xylosus,
Staphylococcus carnosus, Staphylococcus
saprophyticus and Staphylococcus equorum, were
naturally present in the raw meat batter of fermented sausages or added from the
starter culture. These bacteria play role in flavor enhancement of fermented
sausages and inhibit oxidation. However, they are sensitive to long exposure of
acidic environment.

sausages during manufacture.
            The relative abundance was identified at phylum (A) and genus (B) level.
These figures show the changes in the proportion of major phyla and some
common broadly distributed genera of bacteria in meat and meat
products.

        The &#x3B2;-diversity and cluster pattern
        The &#x3B2;-diversity of microbial profiles among each stage of manufacture was
analyzed using QIIME pipeline based on the distance of population profiles.
Population profile distance of each stage is shown in Fig. 3. The closest relationship was observed between
cooking and drying group, while the distance between raw-fermentation,
raw-cooking, raw-drying, fermentation-cooking and fermentation-drying were far
from each other. Environmental changes during manufacturing were the main factor
of these differences. Temperature and relative humidity of the chamber were
similar for both maturation and drying stages. Therefore, the profiles of
microbiota obtained from those stages were almost similar. Raw samples consisted
of all kind of bacteria that naturally found in chicken meat and other natural
ingredients. However, fermentation was suitable only for some species of
bacteria to grow. Lozupone et al. (2007)
mentioned that the microbial community in different environmental conditions
varied according to quantitative and qualitative &#x3B2;-diversity
analysis.

UniFrac.
            The &#xDF;-diversity patterns of samples obtained from raw,
fermentation, cooking and drying stages were explored using the
principal coordinate analysis.

        The clustering patterns were figured out through heatmap analysis at phylum
(Fig. 4A) and genus level (Fig. 4B). The proportions of microorganism at
phylum and genus level that increased or decreased during manufacture were
subjected into heatmap analysis. The population of anaerobic gram-positive such
as Lactobacillus, Lactococcus,
Leuconostoc, and other unclassified
Lactobacillales increased after fermentation. In contrast,
pathogen and spoilage bacteria such as Enterobacter,
Prevotella, and Pseudomonas decreased
after fermentation. The less abundant bacteria with low population such as
Acenitobacter, Bacillus,
Campylobacter, Clostridium,
Escherichia, Enterobacter,
Pseudomonas, Samonella,
Shigella and the absence of Listeria in
the final product highlighted that the manufacturing met a high hygienic quality
standard even though the addition of ground chopi could not diminish the
presence of Clostridium and Shigella at the
end of manufacture. These bacteria have been known to occur and most frequently
isolated from raw meat (Nychas et al.,
2008). The proliferation of lactic acid bacteria contributes to
inhibit and control the growth of some pathogenic bacteria by producing acids
and bacteriocins in meat and meat products (Castellano et al., 2004; Kouakou et
al., 2009). For instance, plantaricin produced by
Lactobacillus plantarum can prevent food spoilage and
inhibit pathogenic bacteria (Leal-Sanchez et
al., 2002). Talon et al.
(2007b) mentioned that formula variation, fermentation and cooking
conditions were related to the composition of microbiota in dry fermented
sausage and lactic acid bacteria constituted the major microbiota at the end of
cooking stage. However, the information regarding characterization at species
level of those lactic acid bacteria was not performed in present study.

      Conclusion
      Ground chopi (Zanthoxylum piperitum) delayed lipid oxidation and
reduced the number of spoilage bacteria in chicken summer sausage during manufacture
with unclear effect on microbial diversity after cooking stage. Fermentation lowered
the species richness and diversity, which were dynamically responded to the
abundance of lactic acid bacteria. The microbial community differed among different
stages of fermented sausage manufacture according to &#x3B2;-diversity analysis and
raw sausage batter was observed having the largest diversity according to
&#x3B1;-diversity analysis. These findings have been showing implications for
understanding the relationship between microbial community in fermented sausage and
the environmental factors, such as ingredients (ground chopi addition), temperature
and pH during manufacture. In addition, the high-throughput sequencing using
Illumina MiSeq and microbial community analysis using QIIME pipeline could identify
the changes in composition of microbiota in summer sausage made from spent layer
meat at all stages of manufacture. While additional studies will be needed to fully
analyze the microorganisms at species level.
