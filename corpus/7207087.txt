red with biotechnological methods using
indigenous microorganisms present in food (Utama et
al., 2019). These methods are practical and economical to preserve food
(Eze et al., 2014). Indonesia is home to
traditional fermented food products such as bekasam, the naturally
fermented fish from Central Java, South Sumatra, and Central Kalimantan. Today,
bekasam is also made of rabbit meat.
      Indonesians people generally avoid consuming rabbit meat because they consider rabbit
as a pet. Therefore, rabbit meat is not widely distributed in Indonesian markets
(Priyanti and Raharjo, 2012).
Interestingly, the nutritional quality of rabbit meat is superior to other species
due to high proteins, high biological value, minerals, and vitamins despite the low
saturated fatty acids, cholesterol, and sodium (El-Medany and El-Reffaei, 2015; Nistor
et al., 2013). Accordingly, rabbit meat-based products are recently
developed to implement food diversification and to increase the consumption of
rabbit meat in Indonesia.
      Three key steps in preparing rabbit meat bekasam include salting
process, carbohydrate addition (rice), and fermentation process. The salting process
aims to select microbes and prevent the growth of pathogen bacteria as spoilage
microorganisms (Doyle et al., 2001). Then,
rice as the source of carbohydrate is added to stimulate the growth of lactic acid
bacteria (LAB) (Putri et al., 2015). On
fermentation, LAB breaks down carbohydrates into lactic acid, propionic acid, acetic
acid, and ethyl alcohol (Ahmed et al., 2013).
These compounds are useful preservatives and impart sour taste to
bekasam (Anihouvi et al.,
2012).
      LAB is the major component in bekasam fermentation. Previous study
on eight types of fish bekasam from eight areas in Indonesia
reported 62 LAB isolates including 19 which exhibited antimicrobial activity against
Escherichia coli, Salmonella typhimurium ATCC 14028,
Bacillus cereus, Staphylococcus aureus, and Listeria
monocytogenes (Desniar et al.,
2013). Therefore, LAB is the potential inhibitor of pathogen microbes and
it may convert into probiotic bacteria (Kerry et
al., 2018).
      Probiotics are beneficial bacteria; they alter the intestinal microflora balance and
inhibit the growth of pathogen microbes. To perform beneficial effects, probiotics
must survive in the gastrointestinal tract, persist in the host and prove safety for
consumers. To survive in the gut, the organism must be tolerant of low pH and bile
toxicity prevalent in the upper digestive tract (Shokryazdan et al., 2016). A study had successfully isolated LAB from
144 kinds of plara (a fermented fish made in Thailand), namely
A. viridans, E. avium, E.
faecalis, E. faecium, E. hirae,
E. thailandicus, L. plantarum, L.
lactis, L. paracasei, P. pentosaceus,
P. acidilactici, T. halophilus, W.
cibaria, W. confusa, W.
paramesenteroides, and W. viridescens (Miyashita et al., 2012).
      Studies on rabbit meat bekasam are currently non-existent in
Indonesia. Therefore, this study investigated the chemical and microbiological
characteristics of rabbit meat bekasam (during the fermentation
process) in order to isolate, characterize (in vitro and in
vivo), and identify LAB as the candidate probiotic bacteria. The
isolated bacteria can be used as the starter for rabbit meat
bekasam.

      Materials and Methods

        Preparation of rabbit meat bekasam
        Nine healthy New Zealand White crossbreed aged 3 months old
weighing 1,800&#xB1;53 g were purchased from Rajawali Farm, Sumedang,
Indonesia. The rabbits were slaughtered used halal method
according to Fuseini et al. (2017).
Carcas was obtained by removing the blood, skin, distal portions of legs, distal
part of the tail, organs located in the thorax and neck (lungs, oesophagus,
trachea, thymus, and heart), genital organs, urinary bladder, gastrointestinal
tract, liver, and kidneys. After deboning, the whole meat was chopped and
rationed to seven batches for seven-day observation. Rabbit meat
bekasam was prepared with a method by Sari et al. (2018) with a slight modification. Rabbit meat
was marinated with 10% salt for 6 h and stored in a sterile container
along with Setra Ramos&#xAE; local rice (1:1 ratio). The container
was tightly closed and incubated at room temperature (27.0&#xB1;2.0&#xB0;C)
for 7 d.

        Proximate composition
        The proximate composition of rabbit meat bekasam was measured
according to the methods of AOAC International
(2012). The moisture content of weight loss was calculated after 12 h
oven-drying at 105&#xB0;C (Digital drying oven DOD-150, Raypa, Barcelona,
Spain). The protein content was measured using an automatic Kjeldahl nitrogen
analyzer (AutoKjeldahl Unit K-370, B&#xFC;chi Labortechnik, Flawil,
Switzerland). Fat content was determined with the Soxhlet method using a solvent
extraction system (SoxtecTM 2050 automated analyzer, FOSS Analytical,
Hiller&#xF8;d, Denmark). A dry ashing method to determine ash content was
conducted by incinerating the meat samples in a furnace (Thermolyne FD1410M,
ThermoFisher Scientific, Waltham, MA, USA) at 550&#xB0;C. Total carbohydrate
was calculated (by difference) using the formula: Total CHO = 100
&#x2013; (moisture% + fat% + protein%
+ ash%).

        Lactic acid content and pH
        The pH value of rabbit meat bekasam was measured using a pH
meter (3510 Advanced Bench pH Meters, Jenway, Staffordshire, UK). Five gram
rabbit meat bekasam was blended with 20 mL distilled water in a
homogenizer for 60 s (Ultra-Turrax T25, IKA, Darmstadt, Germany). Lactic acid
content was determined using the standard titration procedure for total
titratable acidity.

        Microbiological analysis
        Twenty five grams bekasam sample from each treatment was
transferred to 50 mL of sterile saline solution and homogenized for 90 s, and
serial dilutions were prepared by mixing 1 mL of the homogenized sample with 9
mL of sterile saline solution. Total bacteria and total LAB were enumerated by
plating samples on Nutrient Agar (NA, M001, HiMedia) and
Lactobacillus MRS Agar (MRSA, M6411, HiMedia), respectively
after aerobic incubation at 37&#xB0;C for 24 h. Total yeast and moulds were
count by plating serial dilution on Malt Extract Agar (MEA, M137, HiMedia) and
Potato Dextrose Agar (PDA, M137, HiMedia), respectively, after aerobic
incubation at 27&#xB0;C for 48 h. Total Coliform was count on
MacConkey Agar (MCA, MH081, HiMedia) media after incubation at 37&#xB0;C for
48 h. The formed colonies were count and expressed as colony forming units of
the suspension (CFU/g).

        Isolation of LAB
        LAB was isolated by suspending 25 g sample in 225 mL of
Lactobacillus MRS Broth (MRSB, M369, HiMedia) followed by
anaerobic incubation at 37&#xB0;C for 24 h for enrichment, and the MRSB was
serially diluted with sterile saline solution. Appropriate dilutions were spread
on MRSA plates containing 0.3% (w/v) CaCO3 (Calcium Carbonate,
GRM1044, HiMedia) for 48-hour incubation at 37&#xB0;C. LAB produces lactic
acid and reacts with CaCO3 to produce soluble lactate calcium,
characterized by a clear zone around the growing bacterial colonies. The
possible identification of LAB colonies was tested for catalase activity,
motility, and Gram staining. All catalase-negative, non-motil and positive Gram
staining colonies were streaked on the MRSA and incubated at 37&#xB0;C for 48
h to obtain pure colonies. They were stored in slanted semi-solid MRSA at
4&#xB0;C.

        Evaluation of probiotic potential (in vitro)
        The viability in low pH (pH 2.0 and pH 3.0) were examined using 0.1 N HCl to
manipulate the MRSB medium. One mL of 24-h-old LAB culture was pipetted into 9
mL of MRSB pH 2.0 and pH 3.0, incubated at 37&#xB0;C for 3 h. Before and after
a 3-hour incubation, total cells were enumerated in MRSA pouring method,
followed by a 48-hour incubation at 37&#xB0;C (Ngom, 2000). To measure bacteria survival against bile salt, 1 mL of
24-h-old LAB culture was pipetted into 9 mL of MRSB that contained 0.5%
and 1% bile salt (Bile salt, RM008, HiMedia), incubated at 37&#xB0;C
for 48 h, and count the cell using MRSA pouring method.
        Antimicrobial activity was determined by agar well diffusion assay according to
Tagg et al. (1976). The pathogens in
this study were Gram-positive bacteria (Staphylococcus aureus
ATCC 6538; Listeria monocytogenes ATCC 7644) and Gram-negative
bacteria (Escherichia coli ATCC 11229; Salmonella
thypimurium ATCC 14088) obtained from the Central Laboratory of
Padjadjaran University, Jatinangor, Indonesia. Standard chloramphenicol 30 mg/mL
(Chloramphenicol, TC204, HiMedia) were used as a positive control. The pathogens
cultured in Nutrient Broth (NB, M002, HiMedia) were spread on the NA plate 5 mm
diameter wells were made in the plate, poured with 40 &#x3BC;L of LAB isolate,
and incubated at 37&#xB0;C for 24 h. The diameter of the clear zone formed
around the well after incubation was measured to confirm the antimicrobial
activity.

        Identification of probiotic LAB strains by genotypic characterization using
16S rRNA
        LAB isolates were cultured in MRSB (pH 7.0) for 1d and bacterial cells were
collected by centrifugation at 3,185&#xD7;g for 10 min (Sigma 1-16K,
Sigma-Aldrich, Osterode am Harz, Germany). The genomic DNA was extracted in a
method by Zhu et al. (1993) with
modification by Mustopa and Fatimah
(2014). The pellet was resuspended with TE buffer (10 mM Tris-HCl pH
8.0, 1 mM EDTA), 40 &#x3BC;L of lysozyme (60 mg/mL; Lysozyme, PC0710,
Vivantis), incubated at 37 &#xB0;C for 60 min and added with 200 &#x3BC;L
10% sodium dodecyl sulfate, 100 &#x3BC;L 5 M NaCl, and 80 &#x3BC;L
10% centrimide. Furthermore, the solution was warmed at 68&#xB0;C for
30 min, added with equal amount of chloroform, and proceed with centrifugation
at 14,953&#xD7;g speed for 10 min. The supernatant was harvested and 1 mL of
ethanol was added. The mixture was shaken again and then centrifuged at
14,953&#xD7;g for 10 min. after being air-dried, the DNA was dissolved in TE
buffer and the concentration was adjusted to 10 &#x3BC;g/mL DNA and stored at
&#x2212;20&#xB0;C for further analysis.

        Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) amplification for 16S rRNA
        For 16S rRNA sequencing, primers 8F (5'-AGA GTT TGA TCA TGG CTC AG-3'; positions
8 to 27 bp) and 15R (5'-AAGGAG GTG ATC CAA CCG CA-3'; positions 1,541 to 1,522
bp) (Invitrogen, ThermoFisher Scienctific) were used to amplify the full length
of bacterial 16S rRNA fragment (Chao et al.,
2008). Each 25 &#x3BC;L polymerase chain reaction (PCR) mixture
(Invitrogen, 10572014, ThermoFisher Scienctific) contained 10 mM Tris L-HCl (pH
8.3), 50 mM KCl, 1.5 mM MgCl2, 200 &#x3BC;M of each dNTP, 400 nM of
each primer, 1 U of Taq polymerase, and 10 ng of the DNA template. The PCR was
operated at 96&#xB0;C for 5 min, and performed 35 cycles consisting of
96&#xB0;C for 1 min, 58&#xB0;C for 3 min, 72&#xB0;C for 1 min; and
72&#xB0;C for 7 min. The PCR products were subjected to gel electrophoresis in
1% agarose gel, followed by ethidium bromide staining.

        DNA sequencing and phylogenetic analysis
        The DNA sequencing was performed in Macrogen, Korea. An online BLAST analysis
performed similarity searches with sequences were performed by an online BLAST
analysis in the National Centre for Biotechnology Information (NCBI). For the
phylogenetic analysis, sequences were aligned by using the CLUSTAL X software
(Thompson et al., 1997), while the
phylogenetic tree was constructed by the neighbor-joining method (Saitou and Nei, 1987).

        Evaluation of Lactobacillus buchneri (in
vivo)
        Lactobacillus buchneri was cultured in MRSB, incubated at
37&#xB0;C for 24 h, and centrifuged 8,848&#xD7;g for 10 min at 4&#xB0;C.
Supernatants were discarded, and cell pellets were washed three times with
deionized water. For cell suspension preparation, sterile saline was used as a
diluent.
        The study was performed on 20 male BALB/c mice aged 6&#x2013;8 weeks old,
weighing about 22&#x2013;32 g, purchased from PT Biofarma (Bandung, Indonesia).
Experimental animal handling was following the Polish law on the protection of
animals. The Ethics Committee of Universitas Padjadjaran approved all
experiments with Ethical Committee No. 690/UN6.KEP/ EC/2019. The mice were
housed (three per cage) and maintained under conventional conditions (room
temperature 22&#xB1;2&#xB0;C, 12 h day/night cycle). The standard diet
contained 13% maximum water content, 10%&#x2013;12%
protein, 5% fat, 8% fibre, 14% ash, 3% calcium, and
0.7% phosphor.
        The mice were distributed into five dietary groups (four replicates each). After
seven days of acclimatization and fasting for 16 h, each group was administered
(by oral gavage) a single dose of one of five treatments. The treatments
included P1: 0.2 mL sterile saline (negative control); P2: 0.2 mL
1&#xD7;108 CFU of Bifidobacterium bifidum in 1
mL sterile saline (positive control); P3: 0.2 mL 1&#xD7;107 CFU/mL
of L. buchneri in 1 mL sterile saline; P4: 0.2 mL
1&#xD7;108 CFU/mL of L. buchneri in 1 mL
sterile saline; and P5: 0.2 mL 1&#xD7;109 CFU/mL of L.
buchneri in 1 mL sterile saline. The mice were fed for seven
consecutive days. On the eighth day, each animal was inoculated with a single
0.2 mL dose of 1&#xD7;107 CFU/mL of Salmonella
typhimurium in sterile saline. After three days, the mice were
sacrificed by cervical dislocation and were anesthetized by 100 mg/kg (w/w)
intraperitoneal injection of ketamine (Ketamil, Iliuum, New South Wales,
Australia) and 20 mg/kg (w/w) xylazine (Xyla, Interchemie, AC Castenray,
Netherlands).

        Microbiological analysis of fecal contents
        Fresh mice feces were collected and pooled daily from each group from day 0 to
day 4 to enumerate the LAB, Coliform, and
Salmonella using the spread plate method. 1 g fecal was
suspended briefly in 9 mL phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) and vortexed for 1
min. The samples were serially diluted in sterile diluents, and 100 &#x3BC;L
10&#x2212;4 to 10&#x2212;6 dilutions were streaked on
different media for bacterial count, MRSA for total LAB, MacConkey agar for
coliform, and Xylose Lysine Deoxycholate agar (XLDA, M031, HiMedia) for
Salmonella. After 24 h incubation at 37&#xB0;C, the
colonies on the plates were counted and the microbial population was expressed
as CFU/g.

        Statistical analysis
        The proximate analysis was conducted in a randomized design with three replicates
for each experiment to obtain the mean values with p&lt;0.05 significance
level. The data were analyzed using SPSS version 20.

      Results and Discussion

        Physicochemical properties of rabbit meat bekasam
        The proximate composition of rabbit meat bekasam during
fermentation is presented in Table 1. The
moisture content of bekasam was significantly decreased
(p&lt;0.05) from 66.50% to 55.05%. Salt which was added on
bekasam have the ability to decrease the moisture content.
According to Fennema (1996), salt can
decrease moisture content is due to the ability of sodium and chloride ions to
associate with water molecules. Similarly, Majumdar and Basu (2010) reported that the water content of
fermented fish product (Lona ilish) from India was decreased
during fermentation.

        The fat content of bekasam was significantly decreased
(p&lt;0.05) during fermentation procces. The bacteria and yeast performed
lipolytic activity which hydrolyzed fat molecules into free fatty acids, hence,
reducing the fat content. It was in line with Desniar et al. (2009) on the fermentation process of chub mackerel
(Rastrelliger sp.).
        The carbohydrate content of bekasam was reduced significantly
(p&lt;0.05). bekasam as a rice-based fermentation product
was degraded by yeast and mould that produced an extracellular amylolytic
enzymes (&#x3B1;-amylase and glucoamylase).
Kumar et al. (2013) stated that
starch was hydrolyzed into maltose and glucose by amylolytic enzyme which then
converted into lactid acid and other organic acid, decreasing the carbohydrate
content during fermentation. It was confirmed by the decreasing pH and the
increasing lactid acid content in bekasam during fermentation
in this research. On the other hand, protein content was increased significantly
(p&lt;0.05). Protease was hydrolyzing protein into polypeptide and amino
acid which was used by microbes to increase microbial cell. Microbial cells are
mostly build on protein; hence, microbes are known as Single Cell Protein (SCP)
or natural protein concentrates (Kurbano&#x11F;lu, 2001). It was reflected from the increasing LAB
and yeast in this study (Table 2).

              LAB, lactic acid bacteria.

        There was no significant difference in the ash content (p&gt;0.05). It
indicated that during the fermentation process, the microbe used and produced
mineral in a small amount. The minerals of the rabbit meat included potassium,
phosphor, sodium, magnesium, calcium, zinc, iron, copper, and manganese (Hermida et al., 2006).

        Alteration in lactic acid content and pH level during the fermentation
process
        Titratable acidity and pH are illustrated in Fig.
1. The pH was reduced from 5.8 to 4.3, whereas the titratable acidity
was increased from 0.428% to 1.12%. It was due to the accumulation
of lactic acid and organic acid generated during the fermentation process which
promoted the decrease in pH value. The growth of LAB converted carbohydrates to
lactic, acetic, formic, caproic, propionic, butyric, and valeric acids (Zal&#xE1;n et al., 2010). Our findings
are in agreement to previous studies on lower pH values of fermented fish during
fermentation (Desniar et al., 2012; Paludan-Muller et al., 2002).

        Microbiological characteristics of rabbit meat
bekasam
        Microbiological characteristics of bekasam during fermentation
are shown in Table 2. The total bacteria
was improved across 6 days of fermentation and decreased on the 7th
day because low pH (4.4) was not suitable for the growth of several bacteria.
Total LAB and yeast was increased from 3.82&#xD7;106 to
4.67&#xD7;108 CFU/g, and 9.89&#xD7;106 to
3.42&#xD7;108 CFU/g, respectively. In this study, total yeast
was linear to total LAB during fermentation. LAB generates organic acids that
may reduce pH and potentially stimulates the growth of yeast. Meanwhile, yeast
produces vitamin and amino acid to support LAB growth (Fleet, 1990). Paludan-Muller et al. (2002) reported that isolated LAB and yeast
were the dominant fermenting microorganisms for plaa-som, the
fermented fish produced in Thailand.
        The total mould declined from 4.86&#xD7;103 to
4.34&#xD7;101 CFU/g which may due to high salinity in
fermentation. Coliform was present until the second day of
fermentation because it could not survive in high salinity. Salt render
microbial cells to undergo osmotic shock, resulting in the loss of water from
the cell, and subsequently, cell death or retarded growth (Anihouvi et al., 2012). Total Coliform in
this study was similar to &lt;10 CFU/g in fermented fish
(Hout-Kasef) produced in Saudi Arabia (Gassem, 2019).

        Isolation and characterisation of LAB from rabbit meat
bekasam
        LAB isolation using MRSA with calcium carbonate produced 9 isolates. The colony
morfology of isolated bacteria illustrated in Table 3 includes Gram-positive, catalase-negative, and non-motile.
It indicated that indicating all bekasam isolates were
corresponded to the LAB criteria proposed by Kerry et al. (2018).

        Test results of LAB probiotic candidate

          Viability in low pH and bile salt
          Resistance to low pH and bile salts are the key factors to predict the
survival and growth of potential probiotic strains in gastrointestinal
conditions. According to Sahadeva et al.
(2011), low pH incubation was viable at pH 2.0 and pH 3.0 for 3 h
as it stimulates bacterial residency. The viability of LAB in low pH and
bile salt are as presented in Table 4
and Table 5 respectively. In general,
total LAB counts of the nine isolates declined after exposure to low pH, and
they were tolerant in pH 3.0 compared to pH 2.0. The acidity tolerance of
LAB is attributed to a constant gradient between extracellular and
cytoplasmic pH. When internal pH reached the threshold, cellular functions
were inhibited and the cells died (Kashket,
1987).

                LAB, lactic acid bacteria.

          Total LAB declined after exposure to 0.5% bile salts, and four LAB
isolates (3.1, 5.1, 5.2, and 6.3) could not grow after exposure to
1.5% bile salts. Exposure to bile salts triggered the disruptions of
cellular homeostasis which dissociated lipid bilayer and integral protein
from their cell membranes, causing leakage in bacterial content and finally,
cell death. (Tokatli et al., 2015).
Isolate 6.1 and 7.1 in this study were highly tolerant to low pH and bile
salt, producing 106 CFU/mL total LAB which was the minimum total
probiotic microbes (Sahadeva et al.,
2011).

          Antimicrobial activity of LAB isolates
          The antimicrobial activity of all LAB isolates is presented in Table 6. All isolates exhibited a broad
spectrum antimicrobial active against Gram-positive and Gram-negative
pathogenic bacteria. It was in line with Sari et al. (2018) who examined the antimicrobial activities of
fermented fish and discovered that LAB isolates might inhibit Gram-positive
(S. aureus ATCC 25923 with 12.7 mm inhibition zone) and
Gram-negative (Salmonella sp. with 7.3 mm) pathogenic
bacteria. The activity of isolate 6.1 was highest against S.
aureus with a 16.4 mm inhibition zone, and isolate 3.1 was the
least for E. coli (6.2 mm).

          LAB isolates can inhibit the growth of pathogenic microbes because LAB
produces antimicrobial compounds during the fermentation process, such as
organic acid (lactic acid and acetic acid), diacetyl, ethanol, hydrogen
peroxide, reuterin, acetaldehyde, acetoin, carbon dioxide, and bacteriocins
(Garc&#xED;a-Cano et al.,
2014). This study indicated that isolate 6.1 exhibited the highest
antibacterial activity against all pathogens tested except
L.monocytogenes.

          Identification of probiotic LAB strains by genotypic characterization
using 16S rRNA
          Probiotic candidate test on the viability of pH, bile salt, and antimicrobial
activity concluded that isolates 6.1 and 7.1 were the best probiotic
candidate isolates. Both isolates were subject to molecular identification
using 16S rRNA gene analysis. The result of the 16S rRNA gene amplification
could be identified from any fragment of PCR product with the size of 1,500
base pairs (bp) as the desired measurement (Fig. 2).

            Fig. 2.

              Electrophoresis of 16S rRNA gene amplified by PCR in Agarose Gel
1%.

          The homology analysis based on BLAST and SIM revealed that isolate 6.1 had a
genetic relationship with Lactobacillus buchneri, and
isolate 7.1 had the closest genetic relationship with Weisella
paramesentoroides with 99% homology level. According to
Clarridge (2004), the similarity
level of a species is 94%. Phylogenetic tree of isolates 6.1 and 7.1
based on gene sequence of 16S rRNA is shown in Fig. 3.

            Fig. 3.

              Phylogenetic tree of isolates 6.1 and 7.1 based on gene sequence

          One of the identified isolates (L. buchneri) was selected as
a single starter for bekasam future production because it
acquired the Generally Recognized As Safe (GRAS) status (FAO/WHO, 2002). According to Fessard and Remize (2017),
Weisella spp. was not a GRAS starter.

          In vivo probiotic activities
          L. buchneri probiotic isolates were studied in
vivo using BALB/c strain mice to identify the safety use in
fermented food. Mice body weight was recorded (Table 7) to indicate the adverse effect of substrate in
animal study. Table 7 showed that
mice body weight increased during L. buchneri treatment,
and maintained after infection with S. typhimurium. It
indicated that L. buchneri positifely affected
mice&#x2019;s immune system. It was in line with El-Jakee et al. (2010) and Shokryazdan et al. (2016) that mice receiving
probiotics did not undergo body weight loss.

                P1, 0.2 mL of sterile saline (negative control); P2, 0.2 mL dose
of 1&#xD7;108 CFU of Bifidobacterium
bifidum in 1 mL sterile saline (positive control);
P3, 0.2 mL dose of 1&#xD7;107 CFU/mL of
Lactobacillus buchneri in 1 mL sterile
saline; P4, 0.2 mL dose of 1&#xD7;108 CFU/mL of
L. buchneri in 1 mL sterile saline; P5, 0.2
mL dose of 1&#xD7;109 CFU/mL of L.
buchneri in 1 mL sterile saline.

          The results of microbiological test in mice feces are shown in Fig. 4. Results revealed that total fecal
LAB population in the negative control (P1) was lower throughout the
observation days. Total LAB declined after the third day of S.
typhimurium infection in mice which was administered with
probiotic treatment (P2, P3, and P4). L. buchneri cells
treatment increased total LAB in mice feces on the seventh day of L.
buchneri administration, and decreased after the L.
buchneri administration stopped and S.
typhimurium infection started. Accordingly, L.
buchneri could inhibit S. typhimurium
infection by competing for essential nutrition; therefore, total LAB
decreased after the L. buchneri administration stopped.

              Microbiological analysis of mice feces. P1, 0.2 mL of sterile
saline (negative control); P2, 0.2 mL dose of
1&#xD7;108 CFU of Bifidobacterium
bifidum in 1 mL sterile saline (positive control); P3,
0.2 mL dose of 1&#xD7;107 CFU/mL of
Lactobacillus buchneri in 1 mL sterile saline;
P4, 0.2 mL dose of 1&#xD7;108 CFU/mL of L.
buchneri in 1 mL sterile saline; P5, 0.2 mL dose of
1&#xD7;109 CFU/mL of L. buchneri
in 1 mL sterile saline.

          Total Coliform and Salmonella of mice feces
in probiotic treatment were decreased. Salmonella was
non-existent in mice feces on the day before infection. It indicated that
the mice were healthy and not infected by Salmonella. The
effect of probiotic administration on total coliform may increase due to
competition between bacteria to adhere to the epithelial cells of the
intestine Sherman et al. (2005).
Previous studies reported the declining total intestinal
Salmonella due to probiotics effect (El-Jakee et al., 2010; Vasilica and Balotescu, 2006).

      Conclusion
      Rabbit meat bekasam is considered a nutritional and health-promoting
food. This study isolated Lactobacillus buchneri from rabbit meat
bekasam and further analysis showed that it was resistant to
acid pH and bile salts in vitro, and exhibited in
vitro antimicrobial activity against Gram-positive and Gram-negative
pathogen bacteria. The in vivo analysis demonstrated that
L. buchneri was safe up to 109 CFU/g in a 7-day
treatment period. L. buchneri could reduce the populations of
harmful intestinal bacteria and pathogenic bacteria while increasing beneficial
bacterial populations. No adverse effects were observed on the growth of the
experimental animals.
