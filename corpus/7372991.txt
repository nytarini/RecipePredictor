nzymes break down organic substances
into smaller compounds (Schlesinger and Bernhardt,
2013). A result of fermentation is more digestible, stable, and flavored
foods, with enhanced nutritional values (Bernaert et
al., 2013; El-Abbadi et al.,
2014). Yogurt is a fermented milk product obtained from the fermentation of
Streptococcus thermophilus (ST) and Lactobacillus
delbrueckii ssp. bulgaricus (Wasilewska et al., 2019). It was first produced in the Middle
East but has spread worldwide (Wang et al.,
2013); it contains higher levels of protein, vitamin B, and minerals
including calcium, magnesium, potassium, and zinc than milk (El-Abbadi et al., 2014). Furthermore, yogurt is a suitable
dairy product for people who are lactose intolerant, as the lactose in milk is
converted to lactic acid during fermentation (Savaiano, 2014).
      Paprika is the ground spice made from the botanical fruit, pepper, consumed as a
vegetable; it belongs to the Solanaceae family, genus Capsicum, and
the species C. annuum L, and is one of the most consumed vegetables
globally (Di Cagno et al., 2013). It has six
subspecies and is referred to as sweet pepper, bell pepper, and paprika, depending
on the country (Di Cagno et al., 2013).
Capsicum annuum species contain a high concentration of
carotenoid pigments, responsible for the yellow, orange, and red colors of the
vegetables (Halah and Nayra, 2011). Paprika
pigments are composed of capsanthin and capsorubin, which are xanthophyll
carotenoids (Arimboor et al., 2015). Paprika
is known as a health food because it is rich in vitamin A, C, E, and flavonoids
(Hassan et al., 2019; Kantar et al., 2016). The phytochemical content
and physiological activities of paprika differ depending on the color of the paprika
(Kim et al., 2016). Kim et al. (2016) reported that 100 g of dried red and green
paprika contained 70 and 10 mg of carotenoids, 50 and 100 mg of tocopherol, and 750
and 700 mg of polyphenols, respectively. Moreover, green paprika contains high
levels of chlorophyll, yellow and orange paprika contain lutein, zepaxanthin, and
&#x3B2;-carotene, while red paprika contains carotenoid pigments, such as
capsanthin and capsorubin (Arimboor et al.,
2015; Marin et al., 2004).
      Paprika has received attention as a functional food and as a food additive, with
various studies reporting that the phytochemicals in paprika exert antioxidant
(Halah and Nayra, 2011), anti-cancer
(Saponjac et al., 2014), anti-inflammatory (Chen and
Kang, 2013), anti-obesity (Maeda et al.,
2013), and anti-arteriosclerotic activities (Tsui et al., 2018). However, to date, there has been no active
study on the colors of paprika, especially with yogurt and green paprika juice
combined, and no research has been reported on the manufacturing of paprika
color-specific yogurts.
      Therefore, this study investigated the biochemical and active antioxidants
characteristics of yogurt with red, yellow, and orange paprika juice; while
observing the consequent quality changes under storage, this study presents basic
information on the role of these food additives in enhancing food functionality.

      Materials and Methods

        Preparation of paprika juice and stirred yogurt
        Red, orange, and yellow paprika were purchased from a local market in Seoul,
Korea at winter season. For preparing the paprika juice, the paprika were washed
with tap water several times and were dehydrated. The paprika juice for each
color was prepared by grinding in a juicer (DA 5000, Dasung Artron, Paju,
Korea), and the solid particles were separated by filtering, using 4-layer
sterile gauzes (JASCOR, Seoul, Korea) in the clean bench. Yogurt was prepared by
adding skim milk powder (4%), pectin (0.2%), and white sugar
(1%) to the milk and homogenizing using a Homogenizer T 25 (Janke and
Kunkel type, Ika, Germany) for 15 min. The yogurt was inoculated with mixed
strains of ST and L. delbrueckii ssp.
bulgaricus (YO-MIXTM 496 LYO 250 DCU, Danisco, Copenhagen,
Denmark) with 2.5 or 5% of each color paprika juice added. The yogurt was
fermented at 43&#xB0;C for 5 h and stored at 4&#xB0;C.

        pH and fermentation rate
        The pH of the homogenized yogurt was measured using a digital pH meter (ISTEC
735P, Korea). The fermentation rate was determined using equation 1:

        Titratable acidity (TA)
        The titratable acidity (TA) was measured by diluting the paprika yogurt sample to
1:9 with tertiary distilled water, as described previously (Kang et al., 2018). The sample was titrated
with 0.1 N NaOH, with continuous stirring, to an end point of pH 8.3, recording
the volume of NaOH (mL) used. The amount of acid produced during fermentation
was calculated using equation

        Measurements of the lactic acid bacteria (LAB) in the paprika yogurt
        Lactic acid bacteria (LAB) were counted using ST agar plates composed of 10 g
tryptone, 1 g sucrose, 5 g yeast extract, and 2 g K2HPO4
(Saccaro et al., 2011), after
incubation for 48 h at 37&#xB0;C, and expressed as CFU/g. Samples of the
paprika yogurt were diluted; the diluted solutions from each step were spread on
the ST agar plates.

        Measurement of viscosity
        The viscosity of the paprika yogurt was measured using a Bookfield-Viscometer
(Model LVDV-E, Brookfield Engineering Lab., Middleboro, MA, USA) with spindle
No. 63 at 5 rpm. The measurements were recorded three times, at intervals of 30
s after 3 min.

        Syneresis and peptide concentrations
        Syneresis measured the weight of the supernatant following centrifugation
(640&#xD7;g, 4&#xB0;C, 20 min) of samples, and was calculated using equation 3:

        The amino acid content was determined as described previously (Goodno et al., 1981). Samples (30
&#x3BC;L) were mixed with 1 mL of OPA reaction solution and reacted for 2 min
at room temperature. The absorbance was measured at 340 nm with tryptone used as
the reference.

        Color measurement
        Color analysis of the yogurt was performed using a Chroma meter (MINOLTA CHPOMA
METER CR-210). The measurements were conducted under artificial light to
minimize the effects of daylight. The color parameters L* (lightness), a*
(red/greenness), and b* (yellow/blueness) of the yogurt samples were evaluated
according to the International Commission on Illumination (CIE) L*a*b*
system.

        Determination of total polyphenol and flavonoid contents
        After dissolving the paprika yogurt in water and 95% methanol at a ratio
of 1:9, samples were extracted at room temperature for 10 h. Folin-Ciocalteu
reagent (0.2 mL, 1N) was added to each sample (0.2 mL) and thoroughly mixed. The
solution was incubated at room temperature for 3 min, and 1 N
Na2CO3 (400 &#x3BC;L) was added, mixed thoroughly,
and further incubated at room temperature for 90 min in the dark. Absorbance of
each sample was measured at 725 nm (UV-1601, Shimadzu, Kyoto, Japan) after
mixing with 2 mL of distilled water (Wei,
2011). Known concentrations of gallic acid (Sigma-Aldrich,
Schnelldorf, Germany; 5&#x2013;60 &#x3BC;g/mL in ethanol) were treated as the
yogurt extracts. Regression lines of the gallic acid standard were used to
determine the total phenolic content of yogurt water extract using &#x3BC;g
gallic acid equivalents (&#x3BC;g GAE)/mL.
        The total flavonoid content was measured according to a previous method by Abeysinghe et al. (2007). The sample (0.42
mL) was mixed with 2.1 mL diethylene glycol and 0.21 mL 1 N NaOH. The mixture
was incubated for 1 h in a water bath at 37&#xB0;C; the absorbance was
measured at 420 nm using quercetin (Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO, USA) as the
standard.

        Determination of vitamin A and C levels
        The vitamin A and C levels were measured using high performance liquid
chromatography (HPLC) at the Korea Testing and Research Institute, with retinol
and ascorbic acid (Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO, USA) used as the standards.
Vitamin A levels were analyzed using HPLC (Waters 616 system, Waters, Milford,
MA, USA) equipped with SP column C18 (150&#xD7;4.6 mm). Under the analysis
conditions, column temperature was 35&#xB0;C, flow rate 0.6 mL/min, run time
45 min, and injection volume 15 &#x3BC;L. The mobile phase comprised
water:ethanol (20:80, v/v) and vitamin A was detected at 340 and 460 nm. Vitamin
C levels were analyzed using HPLC (Waters 2695 system, Waters, Milford, MA, USA)
equipped with SP column C18 (250&#xD7;3.0 mm). Under the analysis conditions,
column temperature was 40&#xB0;C, flow rate 0.7 mL/min, run time 45 min,
injection volume 20 &#x3BC;L, and detection wavelength 254 nm. Mobile phase A
comprised water:methanol (97.5:2.5, v/v) and H solution 20 mL (heptanesulfonic
acid (1 g)+water (10 mL)+acetic acid (10 mL)). Mobile phase B
comprised water:methanol (50:50, v/v) and H solution (20 mL).

        Antioxidant activity
        Free radical scavenging activities were measured using
2-diphenyl-2-picrylhydrazyl (DPPH) photometric assay, as described previously
(Apostolidis et al., 2007), with some
modifications. One milliliter of a sample was mixed with 0.25 mL of 0.15 mM DPPH
(Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO, USA). The mixture was kept at room temperature in
the dark for 30 min. The absorbance was measured at 517 nm using a spectrometer
(UV-1601, Shimadzu, Kyoto, Japan). Inhibition of DPPH oxidation (%) was
calculated using equation 4 (Apostolidis et al.,
2007):

        Changes in paprika yogurt during storage
        The samples were stored in a 4&#xB0;C refrigerator for 15 days and changes in
pH, TA, LAB count, viscosity, yield, amino acid concentration, antioxidant
activity, and color were assessed at 5-day intervals.

        Statistical analysis
        Data are expressed as means&#xB1;SD of at least three replicates. Statistical
analysis of the data was performed using one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA;
SPSS 20) followed by Duncan&#x2019;s multiple range test and Student t-test for
mean comparison. Statistical significance was considered at p&lt;0.05.

      Results and Discussion

        Characteristics of paprika yogurt according to the paprika juice
levels
        As shown in Table 1, the pH of the paprika
yogurt decreased to 4.44&#x2013;4.53 by increasing the content of paprika juice.
The pH of the paprika yogurt with 5% yellow paprika juice was
significantly lower than that of the yogurt without paprika (p&lt;0.05). The
pH of the paprika yogurt with 5% paprika orange paprika was significantly
higher than that of the other yogurts (p&lt;0.05). The pH of the yogurt with
2.5% red paprika juice was significantly higher than that of the other
yogurts with 2.5% paprika juice (p&lt;0.05). The pH of the paprika
juice used in this study was 4.9&#x2013;5.2 (data not shown), indicating weak
acidity. This indicated that the addition of paprika juice resulted in an
increase in the acidity of the paprika-containing yogurt. The TA value was
0.72% in the yogurt without the paprika juice but was significantly
higher for the red, orange, and yellow paprika yogurts (each p&lt;0.05) with
TA values of 0.88%&#x2013;0.95%. These results were similar to
previous reports of the pH and TA of stirred yogurt with added fermented pepper
powder as 4.3&#x2013;4.61 and 0.8%&#x2013;0.95%. respectively
(Kang et al., 2018; Yu et al., 2014). According to Kim et al. (2011), the total organic acid
content was 12,941.9 and 15,746.56 mg/100 g dry weight in red and green paprika,
respectively. Thus, our results might be attributed to an increase in the
organic acid content because of the addition of the paprika juice.

        The LAB count in yogurts without paprika juice was 10.3&#x2013;10.4
log10 (CFU/g). As the content of red and orange paprika juice
increased, LAB increased to 10.45&#x2013;10.85 log10 (CFU/g), a count
significantly higher than that of control yogurt (p&lt;0.05). The LAB counts
were greater than 9.09&#x2013;9.35 log10 (CFU/g) when red and green
peppers were added to yogurt (Kang et al.,
2018) and were over 100 times higher than the standard value
prescribed by the Jigu Publisher Editing
Department (2001). In this study, there was little change in LAB
between the red, orange, and yellow paprika yogurts. These results demonstrate
that all three paprika juices had positive effects on the growth of probiotic
bacteria. According to the USDA (2019),
raw red paprika has 6 g of carbohydrates and 4 g sugar per 100 g, while Jovanovic-Malinovska et al. (2014) reported
that the carbohydrates in paprika are mostly sugars, such as glucose and
fructose, which are sources of nutrients for probiotic bacterial growth.

        Effect of paprika juice on peptide concentration, syneresis, and
viscosity
        The protein digestion of paprika yogurt without paprika juice was 0.11 mg/mL
(Fig. 1A). However, as the amount of
paprika juice increased, the peptide concentrations significantly increased from
0.11 to 0.21 mg/mL. Lorusso et al. (2018)
reported that LAB increase the concentration of free amino acids. Syneresis in
paprika yogurt without paprika juice averaged 28.3%, a value
significantly lower than that found in the yogurt with 5% orange
(34.98%) and yellow paprika juice (35.35%) (Fig. 1B). The gel network structure in yogurt is a
relatively dynamic system, composed of casein, denatured whey proteins, and
calcium phosphate crosslinks and is affected by many chemical and technological
factors (i.e. dry matter content, enzyme activity, heat treatment, incubation
temperature, and pH) (Lee and Lucey,
2010). Furthermore, Ziarno and Zareba reported that lower pH values
result in higher syneresis (2019).

          Fig. 1.

yogurt by the addition of different colored paprika juices.
            (A) Peptide concentration, (B) Syneresis, (C) Viscosity. Different
capitalized letters indicate significant differences at the same
concentration of paprika juice, regardless of paprika color, and small
letters indicate significant differences at the different concentration
of paprika juice in the same color (p&lt;0.05).

        The viscosity of the paprika yogurt with 2.5% and 5% paprika juice
was 954 and 2,296 cp, respectively, values that were significantly higher than
the viscosity of the yogurt without paprika juice (p&lt;0.05) (Fig. 1C). These results were inconsistent
with reports of Kang et al. (2018) that
the viscosity of yogurt decreased upon addition of fermented red or green pepper
juice. Our results indicated that by increasing the levels of paprika juice, the
pH value of the yogurt dropped. Similarly, Arioui
et al. (2017) who observed that the viscosity of yogurt increased by
lowering the pH. Sinaga et al. (2017)
reported that changes in pH affect the casein micelle size and the gelation
properties, as micelles swell in alkaline pH. These conditions weaken the
cohesive interactions between the micelles, disrupting the hydrophobic bonds
among the caseins, and eventually dissociating the casein micelles (Madadlou et al., 2009).
        Therefore, we believe that the addition of paprika juice increases LAB count,
free amino acid level, and syneresis, but decreases the pH, leading to an
increase in viscosity.

        Effect of paprika juice on color change
        Table 2 shows the changes in the color of
yogurt containing 2.5% and 5% of paprika of different colors. An
increase in the content of red paprika juice significantly decreased the
lightness (CIE L*) of the yogurt, while the redness (CIE a*) increased
significantly (p&lt;0.05). In particular, the redness of the yogurt with
2.5% and 5% red paprika juice was 6.89 and 11.19, respectively,
values that were significantly higher than those for yogurt containing orange
and yellow paprika (p&lt;0.05). The yellowness of the yogurt with 5%
red paprika juice was similar to that of the yogurt without paprika juice. The
redness and yellowness of the orange paprika yogurt were higher than those of
the yogurt without the orange paprika juice but lightness was lower. In most
yogurts containing paprika, the redness and yellowness increased and the
lightness decreased as the amount of paprika juice was increased. According to
Kim et al. (2016), the total
carotenoid content of non-soil-cultivated paprika depends on its color: 55.80
mg/100 g dry weight for red, 62.57 mg/100 g dry weight for orange, and 35.32
mg/100 g dry weight for yellow paprika.

        Total polyphenol content (TPC)
        The TPC of the control yogurt was 132 &#x3BC;g/mL and 131 &#x3BC;g/mL (water
extract and methanol extract, respectively) (Fig.
2). The TPC of the yogurt with the added paprika juice was higher in
the water extract (159&#x2013;287 &#x3BC;g/mL) than in the methanol extract
(134&#x2013;145 &#x3BC;g/mL). In contrast, Kang
et al. (2018) found that the TPC of the methanol extracts was higher
than that of the water extracts of yogurts containing red and green paprika.
Addition of paprika significantly increased the TPC of the yogurt because
paprika contains abundant polyphenols (Kang et
al., 2018). Yogurt with added berries or aronia juice, known to be
good sources of polyphenolic compounds, had higher TPC levels than plain yogurt
(Nguyen and Hwang, 2016; Raikos et al., 2019).

different concentration of paprika juice in the same color
(p&lt;0.05).

        Vitamin A and C levels in the paprika yogurt
        The vitamin A content of the yogurt without paprika juice was 76.54 &#x3BC;g/100
mL, while that of the yogurt with paprika juice was 111.15&#x2013;161.06
&#x3BC;g/100 mL (Fig. 3). Vitamin A
content in the yogurts containing 5% red and orange paprika was
significantly higher than that in the yogurt containing 5% yellow paprika
(p&lt;0.05). Similarly, vitamin C levels were 610&#x2013;1,920 &#x3BC;g/100
mL for the red paprika yogurt, 640&#x2013;2,270 &#x3BC;g/100 mL for the orange
paprika yogurt, and 100&#x2013;1,360 &#x3BC;g/100 mL for the yellow paprika
yogurt. The yellow paprika yogurt had the lowest vitamin C levels. In agreement,
Ch&#xE1;vez-Mendoza et al. (2015)
observed a lower vitamin C level in yellow paprika than red, orange, or green
paprika. In contrast, Nerdy (2018)
observed that the vitamin C content in the yellow, orange, and red paprika was
159.61, 121.38, and 81.19 mg/100 g, respectively. Thus, it can be inferred that
paprika-containing yogurt has abundant levels of vitamins A and C, which are
good antioxidants.

        Antioxidant activity
        The antioxidant activities of both the water and methanol extracts of the yogurts
were significantly increased with the addition of paprika of different colors
(p&lt;0.05) (Fig. 4). Interestingly,
the antioxidant activities of the methanol extracts of the yogurts with paprika
of different colors were 2 to 4-fold higher than those of the water extracts,
although the TPC values of the water extracts were higher than those of the
methanol extracts. This is probably because other bioactive compounds in the
methanol extracts may mainly act on the antioxidant activities. Fresh peppers
contain large amounts of phenolic compounds and vitamin C, and their various
colors are because of the different carotenoid pigments, including
&#x3B2;-carotene, with pro-vitamin A activity, and carotenoids such as
capsanthin, capsorubin, and cryptocapsin, which are effective at scavenging free
radicals (Ch&#xE1;vez-Mendoza et al.,
2015; Deepa et al., 2006).

        Changes in the characteristics of the paprika yogurt during storage
        Since the antioxidant activity and peptide content of yogurt with orange paprika
juice were shown to be higher than the yogurts with other color paprika and
there was little difference between the added levels, yogurt with 2.5%
orange paprika juice was selected to further evaluate its physiochemical
characteristics during a storage period of 15 d at 4&#xB0;C (Table 3; Fig.
5).

            Effect of 15-day storage at 4&#xB0;C on total polyphenol content
and antioxidant activity of yogurt containing 2.5% orange paprika
juice.
            Change in the total polyphenol content of (A) water and (B) methanol
extracts. Change in the antioxidant activity of (C) water and (D)
methanol extracts. Different capitalized letters indicate significant
difference between control and orange paprika yogurt, and small letters
indicate significant difference in control or orange paprika yogurt
(p&lt;0.05).

        pH and TA
        At the end of the storage period, the pH of the control and paprika yogurt
decreased significantly (4.47 and 4.46, respectively; p&lt;0.05). The pH of
the paprika yogurt was 4.46&#x2013;4.64, values that were lower than the pH of
the control (4.47&#x2013;4.76). During the storage period, the pH of yogurt was
4.46&#x2013;4.76, while that of the semisolid type yogurt sold in Korea is
4.18&#x2013;4.60 (Won et al., 2018). The
pH of the yogurt is determined by the organic acid produced during fermentation.
The pH range for improving the functionality and flavor is 4.1&#x2013;4.7 (Lee et al., 2017; Won et al., 2018). Therefore, the paprika addition to
yogurt helps maintain a suitable pH during storage.
        In addition, TA, a parameter that relates to yogurt quality, increased in both
the control and paprika yogurts with the length of the storage. The TA of the
control was 0.77% on day 1 and 0.97% on day 15, while that of the
paprika yogurt was 0.83% on day 1 and 1.01% on day 15. The TA of
the control and paprika yogurt on day 15 of storage was significantly higher
than that on day 1 of storage (p&lt;0.05). A TA for yogurt of
0.85%&#x2013;1.20% is suitable for Korean consumers (Lee et al., 2006). The best quality yogurt
is when the TA is 1.0%&#x2013;1.1% (Kim et al., 1993). Therefore, the results obtained in this
study indicate that the paprika yogurt was well preserved over 15 days of
storage.

        LAB count
        The LAB count of the control and paprika yogurt did not change during storage. As
the storage time increased, the viscosity of control and paprika yogurt
increased significantly (p&lt;0.05). However, there was little change in the
amino acid content; this may be because of poor hydrolysis of proteins and
unchanged LAB counts during storage.

        Syneresis
        Syneresis of the paprika yogurt increased with storage time. Layer separation
occurred during the storage period even though 0.2% pectin was added to
help prevent layer separation of the yogurt. This increased syneresis is
believed to have resulted in an increased viscosity of the yogurt during the
storage period.

        Color values
        The CIE L*, a*, and b* values of the control and the paprika yogurt did not
change over the 15 days, but the CIE b* value was significantly higher in the
paprika yogurt than in the control, believed to be because of the addition of
orange paprika juice.

        TPC and antioxidant activity
        The TPC of the paprika yogurt (157&#x2013;163 &#x3BC;g/mL for water extracts and
114&#x2013;146 &#x3BC;g/mL for methanol extracts) was slightly higher than that
of the control yogurt (140&#x2013;146 &#x3BC;g/mL for water extracts and
114&#x2013;134 &#x3BC;g/mL for methanol extracts) (Fig. 5A and B). For both the control and paprika yogurts,
the antioxidant activities of the methanol extracts did not change but those of
the water extracts increased significantly (p&lt;0.05 Fig. 5C and D). In addition, antioxidant activities of the
water and methanol extracts of the paprika yogurt were higher than those of the
control yogurt. These results show that the addition of paprika juice increased
TPC and antioxidant activities. A significant positive correlation between TPC
and antioxidant activities in bell peppers has been reported (Ch&#xE1;vez-Mendoza et al., 2015; Kim et al., 2011; Medina-Juarez et al., 2012; Zhuang et al., 2012).

      Conclusion
      LAB growth in yogurt was not affected by addition of different colored paprika
juices. Furthermore, the addition of paprika juices increased TPC, levels of vitamin
A and C, and antioxidant activity of yogurt. Thus, this study suggests that paprika
can be a good natural food additive for the development of functional yogurts that
can have an enhanced antioxidant effect and can be used as a natural pigment to
enhance the visual effects of yogurt using a variety of paprika colors.
