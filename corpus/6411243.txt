ediate value products as these products
fetches intermediate value in between muscle steak and traditional burger (Sheard, 2002). This process is very useful in
efficiently utilization of low value carcass cuts, trimmings, meat from spent or
culled animals by application of tumbling, massaging and blade tenderization. These
products are more prone for lipid oxidation and discolouration. Further utilization
of low value meat cuts and trimmings compromises tenderness and flavour of these
products. Rapid expansion of poultry industry leads to availability of huge stock of
spent or culled birds every year after the end of their productive life span.
However, spent hen meat does not fetch higher price and rated poor quality meat in
market due to less juiciness and higher toughness (Kumar et al., 2012). The proper economical disposal of this meat is very
critical for making poultry industry, especially layer farming, remunerative and
attractive.
      For efficient utilization of tough meat of spent hen, various tenderizers are used to
reduce its toughness and improve texture, tenderness and juiciness. These
tenderizers, based on their source, can be grouped into two categories viz.
synthetic (such as calcium chloride) and natural (such papain, bromelin and ficin).
Calcium chloride improves tenderness by activating calpains, a proteolytic enzymes
present in sarcoplasm. In addition, this improves the calcium content of meat (10
mg/100 g) and fortification of meat with calcium is highly desired for meeting RDA
(recommended dietary allowance) through meat products. Calcium supplementation can
be either in organic form as calcium lactate or inorganic form as calcium chloride.
However, organic form contains more bioavailable calcium, bland taste and neutral
aroma, but inorganic form contains higher calcium content, highly soluble in water
and relatively in-expensive (Irshad et al.,
2016).
      With ever increasing awareness and increasing demand for natural and minimally
processed meat products, focus has now shifted to develop foods without or with
minimal synthetic compounds. There are huge amount of waste generated every year
from fruit processing industry as by-products and a significant proportion of this
is not properly utilized. It poses serious concerns for solid waste disposal and
environmental hazard. These byproducts are rich in many functional ingredients such
as protein, minerals, dietary fibre, carotenoids and polyphenols (Lamsal and Faubion, 2009). Their proper and
efficient utilization have potential to open new arena for development of functional
products.
      Pineapple (Ananas comosus or Bromelia ananas) is a
tropical plant of Bromeliaceae family containing coalesced berries. As per Hepton and Hodgson (2003),
35%&#x2013;40% of waste generated from utilization of pineapple in the
form of peel, stem and centrifugal solids. These wastes are rich source of bromelin
and bioactive compounds. The raw fruit is a rich source of manganese, vitamin C and
sulfur compounds. Bromelin, a mixture of proteinase enzymes, is commercially
prepared from stem, fruit of pineapple, widely used in medicines due to its
fibrinolytic, antithrombic, anti-inflammatory and anti-edematous properties. It also
has tenderizing effect and used in meat tenderization. Pineapple peel powder is rich
in polyphenols, carotenoids, dietary fibre, minerals, protein and was known to
increase the growth of probiotic cultures by exerting pre-biotioc effect comparable
to inulin (Diaz-Vela et al., 2013; Sah et al., 2015). Their incorporation in
product development had significant effect on various functional attributes such as
improved oxidative stability, rheological, textural, physico-chemical and
microstructural parameters (Lucey, 2002;
Sah et al., 2016).
      Fig (Ficus carica) is regarded as indispensable fruits on tropics
due to its higher nutritive value (Slavin,
2006). It is an integral part of Mediterarrian diet which is boasted as
one of the healthiest diet associated with longetivity (Trichopoulou et al., 2006). The fruit is mostly consumed fresh
with or without peeling as well as in dried form as drying extended its storage life
(Verbic et al., 2008). The raw fruits get
ripen early due to proteolytic action of ficin enzyme dissolving pectin. This enzyme
is widely used for meat tenderization. Figs are rich in calcium, dietary fibre,
minerals, phenolic compounds, vitamins and amino acids along with organic acid and
sugar (Joseph and Raj, 2011; Solomon et al., 2006). Verberic et al. (2008) reported rutin as highest phenolic
compounds present in fig followed by catechin, chlorogenic acid, epicatechin, gallic
acid and syringic acid. Most of the phytochemicals exerting antioxidant effects
(such as polyphenols, anthocyanin and flavonoids) are concentrated in skin, hence
fruit with darker skin exerts higher antioxidant activity. The total sugar content
of figs (10%&#x2013;22% in dried figs) varies with the cultivars,
drying methods and seasons (Slatnar et al.,
2011) and 92% of its carbohydrates as simple sugars.
      Incorporation of these powders in place of pure enzymes would have additional
benefits of improving dietary fibre, mineral contents and antioxidant properties
besides alleviating problem of solid waste disposal of these fruits industry.
Changes in colour and development of rancidity due to lipid oxidation are major
problem in restructured meat products (Akamittatha et
al., 1990). This ensures better oxidative stability of incorporated meat
products and extended storage life leading to improved economics. Thus present study
was envisaged to evaluate efficacy of these natural tenderizers in comparison to
synthetic tenderizer and its effect on quality attributes of restructured spent hen
meat slices (RSHS).

      Materials and Methods

        Source of materials
        White leghorn chickens over 72 weeks of age were procured from Directorate of
Livestock Farm, Guru Angad Dev Veterinary and Animal Sciences University,
Ludhiana and scientifically slaughtered in the Departmental Poultry Processing
Plant by following standard protocols. These dressed chickens were chilled for
24 h at refrigeration temperature. Carcasses were deboned manually and deboned
meat was stored in low density polyethylene bags at &#x2013;18&#xB0;C until
use. Before use, the frozen meat was thawed at refrigeration temperature and cut
manually into approximately 1 cm cube.
        Refined salt, refined wheat flour, low density polyethylene films (200 gauges)
bags, onion, ginger and garlic were procured from local market of Ludhiana,
India. All spice ingredients (Verma et al.,
2015) were procured from local market, cleaned, washed, dried and
ground into fine powder.

        Preparation of pineapple peel powder and fig powder
        Pineapple peel was collected from local fruit market and juice shops, quickly
brought to the department, rinsed with potable water and crushed. Non-marketable
edible figs were collected from local fruit market. These fruits were cleaned
and crushed. The crushed material was dried in vacuum oven (NSW, New Delhi,
India) at 60&#xB0;C for 24 h and ground to fine powder. The powder was
packaged in polyethylene terephthalate (PET) jars and stored at ambient
temperature for use.

        Preparation of restructure spent hen meat slices
        Based on several preliminary trails, a total number of 4 tenderizing mixtures
were prepared in water containing 0.3% sodium tetra polyphosphate and 120
ppm sodium nitrite and following ingredients viz.

            Mixture 1 for Control - 1.7% sodium chloride

            Mixture II for T1 - 1.25% calcium chloride, 0.5% sodium
chloride

            Mixture III for T2 - 1.50 % pineapple peel powder

            Mixture IV for T3 - 1.5% fig powder

        These spent hen cubes were put for marinating for 5 h under refrigeration by
mixing the respective tendering mixture along with all other ingredients as per
Table 1. The mixture was put in
vacuum tumbler (Promarks Vac. Co. Ltd, Taiwan) and vacuum tumbling was done for
2.5 h until the mixture became tacky exudates. The meat batter was removed from
vacuum tumbler, and analyzed for pH, water holding capacity, collagen content
and protein solubility. The batter was filled in aluminum moulds (7.5
cm&#xD7;7.5 cm&#xD7;6.0 cm) and was cooked in autoclave for 15 min at 15 psi
and tempered to room temperature. The meat blocks were put for chilling at
4&#xB1;1&#xB0;C for overnight and cut into slices of 7 mm thickness with the
help of mechanical slicer (Sirman, Auto m, 300 VV, Italy). These slices were
packaged in aerobic packaging in low density polyethylene films (100 gauge)
(Ramon Packaging Machine: VP-580 A Model , type 19/S/CL, Germany) and analyzed
for various physico-chemical, proximate, oxidative stability and sensory
parameters at a regular interval of 7 days for 21 days.

        Physico-chemical parameters
        Water holding capacity (WHC) of RSHS was estimated as per method prescribed by
Bosco et al. (2001) with suitable
modifications. 1 g sample was put into tissue paper and centrifuged (Thermo
Scientific SOR VALL ST 16R) for 4 min at 72.8&#xD7;g. Centrifuged meat sample
was weighed after removing tissue paper and dried at 70&#xB0;C for 12 h under
hot air oven.

        The pH of RSHS was observed by using digital pH meter (SAB 5000, LABINDIA,
Mumbai, India). The moisture percent (by oven drying), protein percent (by
Kjeldahl distillation), fat percent (by Soxhlet method) and ash percent (by
muffle furnace) of developed products were assessed as per method described by
Association of Official Analytical Chemists (AOAC, 2000).
        Cooking yield was calculated by noting the change in product weight before and
after cooking&#x2013;

        Hydroxyproline (HP) content is used as indicator to collagen
(Collagen=7.25&#xD7;HP). HP of raw batter was determined by using
method described by Neuman and Logan (1950) with slight modifications. 2 g of
sample was hydrolyzed with 40 mL 6N HCl at 105&#xB0;C for 18 h and filtered.
Suitable aliquot (25 mL) with pH 7 was taken in a test tube and 1 mL each of
0.0N copper sulphate, 2.5N sodium hydroxide and 6% hydrogen peroxide were
added. This was kept at room temperature for 5 min followed by putting at water
bath at 80&#xB0;C for 5 min. The sample was chilled in ice and 4 mL 3N
sulphuric acid and 2 mL 5% DMED (4-dimenthyleaminobenzaldehyde) in
n-propanol were added. The absorbance was measured at 540 nm by using Synergy
Hi-hybrid reader. The HP content was expressed in % mg/g of tissue by
referring to a standard graph.

        Texture profile analysis
        Texture profile analysis (TPA) of RSHS was conducted by the procedure described
by Bourne (1978) using a texture analyzer
(TMS-PRO, Food Technology Corporation, Sterling, VA, USA). The samples (1.5
cm&#xD7;1.5 cm&#xD7;1.5 cm) were placed on a platform in a fixture and
compressed twice to 80% of their original height by a compression probe
(P75) at a cross head speed of 10 mm/s through a two cycle sequence. Texture
profile parameters were determined and interpreted as hardness, stringiness,
cohesiveness, gumminess and resilience.

        Instrumental colour profile analysis
        Instrumental colour profile of RSHS were measured by recording L*,
a*, and b* values by using Chroma Meter (Konica Minolta-CR-300).
The instrument was calibrated by using white calibration kit supplied with
equipment. The hue and chroma values were calculated by using following formula
(Froehlich et al., 1983).

        Determination of lipid oxidation parameters
        Various lipid oxidation parameters such as thiobarbituric acid reacting
substances (TBRAS) (Witte et al., 1970),
free fatty acid (FFA) and peroxide value (PV) (Koniecko, 1979) were determined to assess the oxidative stability of
RSHS.

        Microbiological quality
        Microbiological quality in terms of standard plate count (SPC), coliforms count
and psychrophilic count of RSHS were determined as per method prescribed by
APHA (1984). Triplicate plates were
prepared and microbial counts were expressed as colony forming units per gram
(Log CFU/g). All the process of sample preparation and serial dilution were
performed under aseptic conditions, near flame in pre-sterilized horizontal
laminar flow apparatus (Model Rescholar, M. No. RH-58-C3, Ambala Cantt,
India).

        Sensory evaluation
        A panel of twelve experienced members comprising faculty and post-graduate
students of the department assessed the developed restructured spent hen meat
slices for appearance and colour, texture, flavour, juiciness and overall
acceptability on 8-point descriptive scale (Keeton 1983), where 8=extremely liked and 1=extremely
unliked. Samples were warmed (40&#xB0;C&#x2013;45&#xB0;C) using a microwave
oven for 90 sec before serving to panelist in sensory laboratory of the
department. To check reliability of procedure, control sample was introduced in
evaluations two times, randomized among other samples. Potable water was
provided for rinsing mouth in between samples during sensory evaluation.

        Statistical analysis
        Data obtained during various experiments were analyzed on SPSS-16.0 software
packages, IBM Corporation, USA (Snedecor and
Cochran, 1989). Duplicate samples were drawn for each parameter and
whole set of experiment was replicated six times (n=6). Means in between
periods of storage were compared by two-way analysis of variance (ANOVA). The
statistical significance was estimated at 5% level (p&lt;0.05) and
evaluated with Duncan&#x2019;s Multiple Range Test (DMRT).

      Results and Discussion

        Physico-chemical parameters
        Incorporation of natural and synthetic tenderizers had significant effect on
physico-chemical quality of RSHS (Table
2). Inclusion of natural tenderizers resulted in decreasing pH of RSHS as
compared to control in both raw batter and cooked product. The pH of raw control
and T1 (product with 1.25% calcium chloride) was found comparative and
significantly (p&lt;0.05) higher than raw T2 and raw T3. Among raw products,
the lowest pH was recorded for T2. In cooked products, pH of control was noted
significantly (p&lt;0.05) higher than all other treated products. The pH
value of treated products varied significantly with T2 samples showing the
lowest value with following order T1&gt;T3&gt;T2. The pH of cooked
products was recorded higher than corresponding value of their raw products.
This increased pH on cooking compared to raw product could be due to
denaturation of meat proteins at higher temperature and formation of imidazolium
compounds from amino acids having imidazole side chain as well as with reaction
between ammonia and aldehydes. Kumar et al.
(2018a; Kumar et al., 2018b)
also reported similar increase in pH upon cooking in pork patties incorporated
with sapota powder and watermelon rind extracts. The lower pH of T2 and T3
samples could be due to low pH of pineapple peel powder (4.12) and fig powder
(5.63).

        WHC is an important attributes affecting cooking yield, moisture losses during
transportation and storage, organoleptic attributes of cooked meat, fading of
colour, low water retention and other quality attributes (Apple and Yancey, 2013). Increased extraction and solubility
of muscle proteins leads to increased binding sites for water molecules
resulting in improved WHC. The increased extraction of proteins and solubility
due to effect of proteolytic enzymes present in pineapple powder and fig powder
could have resulted in increased binding sites for water molecules leading to
higher WHC of the batter. The WHC of raw batter increased significantly
(p&lt;0.05) with the incorporation of natural and synthetic tenderizers. The
WHC of T2 sample was recorded highest followed by T3 and T1 and control. van Laack (1999) reported higher WHC and
lower drip loss of fresh meat with higher sarcoplasmic protein in meat. In
addition to this, pH (either increase or decrease than isoelectric point of
muscle proteins, pI 5.0&#x2013;5.3) had direct effect on WHC by creating larger
hydrophilic sites in polypeptide chain to attach water molecules (Naveena et al., 2011) due to electrostatic
force.
        HP content of control as well treated samples was recorded comparable. The
collagen content of control was recorded lower than treated products. The
synthetic tenderizers were known to initiate action of calpains responsible for
controlled proteolysis. The higher value for T2 and T3 could be due to bromelain
and ficin present in pineapple and fig powder, respectively in addition to
calcium and minerals. A comparable collagen content in buffalo meat (Naveena et al., 2011) and in emu meat
chunks (Verma et al., 2018b) in presence
of different tenderizers had been also reported. Collagen solubility of T2
samples was recorded highest and significantly (p&lt;0.05) higher than T3,
which exhibited significantly (p&lt;0.05) higher value than T1. The collagen
solubility of control products recorded significantly lower value than T1. The
significantly higher collagen solubility of products with natural tenderizers
(T2 and T3) as compared to product with synthetic tenderizers (T1) could be due
to presence of enzymes in the incorporated pineapple and fig powder in addition
to salt. The higher collagen solubility of treated products could be due to
increased enzymatic action on collagen in addition to actomyosin proteins,
resulting high tender meat. Bromelain has been reported to exert higher
enzymatic proteolysis and ability to digest collagen. Belcher et al. (2016) also noted significantly higher
collagen disintegration activity of bromelain and recommended its use in removal
of debris after burns. Comparative lower value of T3 (product with fig powder
containing ficin) in comparison to T2 (product with pineapple powder containing
bromelain) could be due to comparatively lower efficiency of digesting collagen
by ficin as compared to bromelain. Ficin has ability to digest collagen in
presence to heat or at higher salt concentration. The effect of these enzymes on
collagen in native state was very poor and efficiency of these enzymes had been
reported to improve in presence of heat, lower pH and high salt concentration.
Under favourable conditions, these enzymes had ability to digest elastin to some
extent. El-Gharbawi and Whitaker (1963)
and Hinrichs and Whitaker (1962) also
reported efficiency of bromelain, ficin and salt in tenderization of beef by
digesting denatured collagen by bromelain, ficin and elastin to some extent by
salt and ficin at low pH, high salt concentration and higher temperature. In the
present study, the pH variations among treatments were comparable and thus the
role of pH was not expected to exert any visible effect.
        The findings of total soluble protein (g protein extracted per 100 g of total
muscle protein) recorded significantly (p&lt;0.05) higher value for product
incorporated with natural tenderizers in comparison to product with synthetic
tenderizer and control. The total soluble protein value of T2 and T3 were
comparable. This could be due to enzymatic action of enzymes present in natural
tenderizers on muscle proteins and collagen. The synthetic tenderizer used in
the present study was known to activate proteolytic activity of calpain enzymes
altering integrity of actomyosin and higher amount of extracted protein. Verma et al. (2018b) attributed the higher
protein solubility to the increased permeability of myofibrils and
disintegration thereof. Ramezani et al.
(2003) reported increased WHC of meat tenderized by ficin and noted
increased solubility of meat proteins based on electrophoresis method.
        The cooking yield of T2 was recorded the highest and significantly higher than
T3. This could be due to high content of dietary fibres in pineapple peel and
fig powder, making these products capable to retain more water during cooking.
Huang et al. (2011) reported high
amount of insoluble fibre (41&#x2013;48 g/100 g) in pineapple peel comprising
cellulose, hemicelluloses and pectic compounds. The peel also contained high
amount of lignin (60&#x2013;66 g/ 100 g). These fibre rich fractions had been
attributed to have higher water (8&#x2013;12 mL/g) and oil binding (6&#x2013;9
mL/g), swelling capability (11&#x2013;18 mL/g) properties. These fractions
improved WHC of raw batter and cooking yield of the product. The cooking yield
of T1 was recorded as lowest value. The lower cooking yield of T1 in comparison
to control could be due to higher denaturation effect of calcium chloride on
meat proteins, thus having less capacity to retain juice during cooking. The
moisture content of T2 and T3 were significantly (p&lt;0.05) higher than
control and T1. Protein and fat content of all samples were comparable, whereas
ash content of control and T1 samples was comparable but significantly lower
than ash content of T2 samples. This could be due to high mineral content of
pineapple peel powder than control and other treatments.

        Sensory attributes
        Effects of various natural and synthetic preservatives on the sensory attributes
of RSHS are presented in Table 2. The
incorporation of pineapple peel powder resulted in improved sensory attributes
and these were comparable to control. The incorporation of fig powder resulted
in decreased sensory attributes and were significantly (p&lt;0.05) lower
than T2. This lower value of T3 could be due to poor binding and texture score
due to presence of higher amount of sugar. The appearance and colour scores of
T2 and T3 were significantly (p&lt;0.05) higher than T1 and control. This
could be due to presence of carotenoid compounds in these powder as well as
sugar leading to non-enzymatic browning reaction (Maillard reaction). The
flavour score of T3 was recorded significantly (p&lt;0.05) lower than all
other samples. T2 had the highest flavour scores which in-turn had comparable
value to control and T1. Sensory attributes of product with synthetic
tenderizers was found comparable to control and with T2 except overall
acceptability. The overall acceptability of T2 was significantly (p&lt;0.05)
higher than control and T1, which in-turn showed rated significantly
(p&lt;0.05) higher T3. The significantly lower overall acceptability of T3,
RSHS with fig powder could be due to modification flavour, binding and
tenderness of these samples. Sensory panelist noted poor binding, excessive
tenderness and marked flavour in T3 samples during sensory evaluation
process.

        Instrumental colour and texture profile analysis
        Colour and texture profile plays very important role in determining consumer
acceptance and marketability of product. Addition of tenderizers affected the
colour attributes of RSHS (Fig. 1).
Lightness (L*) value of T3 was recorded significantly higher than control
and other treatments. These values were in correlation with appearance score
under sensory analysis. The redness (a*) value of T2 was significantly
(p&lt;0.05) lower than T1 and control and T3. The a* value of T1 was
significantly higher than control and other treatments. This could be due to
presence of calcium chloride and lower flavonoids and pigments as the case of T2
and T3 samples. Thus red colour of meat was prominent in these products. Kumar et al. (2018a) also reported
decreasing redness (a*) value in pork patties upon incorporation of
sapota powder and attributed it to non-enzymatic browning (Maillard reaction).
Verma et al (2015) also noted the
similar findings in pork patties. The higher yellowness value in T2 and T3 might
be due to presence of flavonoids and carotenoids in pineapple peel powder and
fig powder. Verberic et al. (2008) also
noted high amount of phenolic compounds in fig fruit. Li et al. (2014) reported gallic acid, catechin,
epicatechin and ferulic acids as major polyphenolic compounds in pineapple peel
extracts. Fig also have perceivable amount of sugar, organic acids, minerals,
vitamins and dietary fibres (Slavin,
2006; Solomon et al., 2006).

and natural tenderizers.

1.5% pineapple peel powder; T3, RSHS with 1.5% fig powder;
RSHS, restructured spent hen meat slices.

        The texture profile analysis of RSHS revealed that product with synthetic
tenderizer (calcium chloride) and control had higher textural attributes than
product with natural tenderizers (T2 and T3) (Table 2). Out of all samples studies, T3 exhibited the lowest
textural attributes. This could be due to action of ficin and presence of higher
sugar in T3, leading to poor binding properties. T2 samples showed significantly
(p&lt;0.05) higher hardness than T3. This could be due to better binding
ability of T3 due to presence of high amount of dietary fibres.

        Storage studies

          pH
          Upon refrigeration storage of RSHS, there had been significant change in pH
of control as well as treated products (Fig.
2). The pH value of control and T1 had been noticed increasing
trends, whereas pH value for T2 and T3 was noted decreasing trends with the
advancement of storage period. Among treatments, pH value was noted
comparable for all samples upto 7th day of storage afterward, on
14th day of storage study, pH value of T3 was significantly
(p&lt;0.05) lower than control and T1, whereas pH value of T2 was
comparable to all other samples. The mean pH value of T2 and T3 was noted
significantly (p&lt;0.05) lower than control and T1 on 21st
day of study. This could be due to presence of sugars and carbohydrates in
fig powder and pineapple peel powder, which was converted to lactic acid
upon storage during fermentation by microbes. The increase in pH during
storage for control and T1 could be due to increase in microbial load during
storage causing protein denaturation and accumulation of its metabolites.
Similar findings of increasing pH were also noticed Kumar et al. (2018a) during storage of pork patties
incorporated with sapota powder.

          Lipid oxidation parameters

            Thiobarbituric acid reactive substances (TBARS) value
            Lipid oxidation is very important criteria to determine the shelf life of
meat products. This process begins due to reactions in between molecular
oxygen and unsaturated phospholipid fractions of membranes and
unsaturated fatty eaters, leading to generation of peroxides, hydroxides
and carbonyl compounds. In presence of trace elements, there is
production of several non radical compounds such as acids, aldehydes,
alcohol and ketones resulting in poor sensory attributes and loss of
nutritive quality (Benzie, 1996;
Valenzuela and Nieto, 1996).
The intermediary compounds formed during lipid oxidation process (such
as free radicals, hydroperoxides, reactive oxygen species, etc.) have
very short half-lives which make their detection and quantification very
difficult. Thus, alternatively, oxidative stress is measured by
assessing compounds which are more stable such as MDA (malondialdehyde).
Thiobarbituric acid reactive substances (TBARS) (thiobarbituric acid
reacting compounds) formed due to reaction in between TBA
(thiobarbituric acid) and MDA is widely used to assess the degree of
lipid oxidation (Liu et al.,
1997). The increase in TBARS value during storage indicates
production of secondary lipid oxidation products. Release of pro-oxidant
compounds during storage such as ferric ions further enhances the rate
of lipid oxidation (Verma et al.,
2018a).
            TBARS value of control as well as treatments increased significantly with
the passage of storage days (Fig.
3). Among treatments, upto 14th day of storage, all
samples under study were noticed with comparable TBARS value. The TBARS
value of control and T1 were remained comparable throughout storage
period. The rate of increase in TBARS value was higher in control and T1
samples, whereas it was recorded lowest for T2. This could be due to
presence of natural antioxidant compounds such as polyphenols,
flavonoids and anthocyanins in pineapple peel and fig powder, exerting
inhibition effect on lipid oxidation and formation of its metabolites.
Verberic et al. (2008) also
noted high amount of phenolic compounds in figs such as rutin (28.7),
catechin (4.03 mg), chlorogenic acid (1.71 mg) and epicatechin (0.97) on
mg/ 100 g fresh weight basis. Li et al.
(2014) reported gallic acid, catechin, epicatechin and
ferulic acids having corresponding value (mg/100 g dry extract) 31.76,
58.51, 50.0, and 19.50 respectively, as major polyphenolic compounds in
pineapple peel extracts. These compounds are known to exert antioxidant
properties. Further, there has been increase in microbial population
upon storage and several published studies had established positive
correlation between microbial load and TBARS (Kumar et al., 2018a; Kumar et al., 2018b; Raja et al., 2014). Harzallah et al. (2016) attributed the antioxidant activity
of different fruit powders in food system to presence of total
polyphenols, flavonoids, ortho-diphenols, tannins and anthocyanin.

              Fig. 3.

1.5% fig powder; RSHS, restructured spent hen meat
slices.

          Free fatty acids (FFA) and peroxide value (PV)
          Free fatty acid (Fig. 4) and peroxide
values (Fig. 5) of RSHS recorded
increasing trends with elapse of storage days. FFA value of control and T1
sample was recorded highest than other samples throughout the storage
period. FFA value of T2 and T3 was recorded significantly lower than T1 and
comparable to control on 7th day of storage. Among treatments, PV
value of all samples was comparable except on 21st day of
storage. On last day of storage, PV value of T2 was the lowest value
followed by T3, T1 and control. This lower value of FFA and PV in T2 and T3
samples could be due to antioxidant as well as antimicrobial effect of
flavonoids and polyphenols present in natural tenderizers used in the study
in the form of pineapple peel powder and fig powder.

fig powder; RSHS, restructured spent hen meat slices.

          Microbial quality
          The mean SPC increased in all samples with the advancement of storage period
(Fig. 6). The SPC of control and T3
increased significantly (p&lt;0.05) with the advancement of storage
period, whereas SPC of T1 and T2 were having comparable value on 7 and 14
days, but significantly (p&lt;0.05) higher than 0 day and lower than
21st day of storage. Throughout the storage period, the
highest value of SPC was recorded for control which was comparable to T1
except on 14th day of storage. Comparatively lower value of T2
and T3 samples could be due to antibacterial activity of phenolic compounds
present in skin/rind of fig and pineapple. Solomon et al. (2006) and Veberic et al. (2008) also reported dried figs as rich source of
polyphenols, with most of these compounds located in skin and higher levels
in figs with darker skin. Puupponen-Pimia et
al. (2001) also reported antimicrobial activity of phenolic
compounds. Further, lower pH of these samples also contributed to the lower
microbial count in these samples during storage as low pH was known to
increase cell injury and prolong lag phase as noted by Kumar et al. (2018b) in pork patties incorporated with
watermelon rind extract.

fig powder; RSHS, restructured spent hen meat slices.

          In the present study, coliforms were detected during storage studies on
14th day in all samples and increased significantly
(p&lt;0.05) with elapse of storage period. The lower value of coliforms
in RSHS with natural tenderizers indicated antimicrobial effect of these
powders. Psychrophiles were noted on 7th day of storage in all
samples including control and treatments, thereafter, a significant increase
in psychrophiles was recorded in all samples. The initial absence of
psychrophiles during storage could be due to lower metabolic rate of these
microbes leading to extending lag phase. This detection of psychrophiles and
coliforms after initial absence could be due to the reason as bacteria
generally need some lag phase before starting active multiplication in log
phase. On the last day of storage, the lowest microbial count was recorded
in T3 and the highest in control.

          Sensory quality
          The main criterion for spoilage of RSHS during present study was flavour
emanating at the time of opening of packets for sensory analysis. Any
abnormal development in colour and sliminess were also noted. The sensory
panelists have noted marked deterioration in flavour of control and T1
samples on 21st day of storage; hence, these two samples were not
evaluated for sensory evaluation on last day of storage.
          Sensory attributes of RSHS showed decreasing trends with the increasing
storage days (Table 3). The
appearance and colour score decreased with the advancement of storage period
and on 14th day, these attributes were significantly
(p&lt;0.05) lower than 0th and 7th day of storage
for C, T1 and T3. Among all samples studied, T2 and T3 were recorded with
higher appearance and colour score. This might be due to presence of sugar
in dried powders leading to non-enzymatic browning reaction and carotenoid
compounds. In T2 samples, the presence of polyphenolic compounds resulted in
modification of colour of RSHS, thus reducing appearance and colour value.
Control and T1 samples did not have such compounds which have modifying
effect on natural colour of RSHS. These results are in accordance with our
instrumental colour profile of RSHS.

                Means with different superscripts (a, b, c and A,
B, C) differ significantly (p&lt;0.05) in a row
and column respectively; n=6 for each treatment (C,
control; T1, RSHS with 1.25% calcium chloride; T2, RSHS
with 1.5% pineapple peel powder; T3, RSHS with
1.5% fig powder; ND, not detected; NP, not performed;
RSHS, restructured spent hen meat slices.

          Flavour scores of T2 were significantly (p&lt;0.05) higher than T3 which
in-turn was comparable to control and T1. A gradual decrease in flavor score
could also be attributed to the expected loss of volatile flavour compounds
from spices and condiments on storage of meat products (Bhat et al., 2015). The marked
deterioration of flavour scores of control and T1 could be due to higher
microbial growth as well as pronounced lipid oxidation thus emanating foul
odour from these samples. These results were in accordance with our findings
on microbial quality and lipid oxidation parameters. The presence of
phenolic compounds in T2 and T3 due to pineapple peel powder and fig powder,
could have exerted antioxidant effects and thus retarded the process of
lipid oxidation and development of rancid flavour. Within groups, juiciness
scores of T2 was observed significantly (p&lt;0.05) higher than control
and other treatments on 0th day and 7th day, whereas
control, T1 and T3 showed comparable values on these two days. On
14th day of study, all samples have comparable value. The
juiciness and tenderness of T3 was recorded significantly lower than all
other samples. This could be due to poor binding of these samples. These
findings are in accordance with texture profile analysis. The deterioration
in juiciness and tenderness scores could be attributed to protein
denaturation leading to change in disulphide bonds due to increasing
microbial load and moisture loss. Singh et
al. (2015) also reported similar trends of decreasing juiciness
and tenderness scores of chevon cutlets stored under aerobic packaging
condition.
          Overall acceptability of RSHS also decreased upon advancement of storage
period and it followed the same pattern as observed for flavour scores and a
significant decrease (p&lt;0.05) in overall acceptance of all samples
were observed from 7th day onward. The overall acceptability of
T3 and T2 were found close to good to moderately acceptable category
(5.89&#x2013;6.11) even on last day of storage study (21st day).
Thus natural tenderizers have increased the storage life of RSHS due to
presence of antioxidant and antimicrobial compounds in them, in addition to
making this meat more tender and acceptable.

      Conclusion
      Thus, it can be concluded that good quality RSHS could be prepared by incorporating
of pineapple peel powder and fig powder as natural tenderizers. The use of these
compounds have been shown to have additional antioxidant and antimicrobial
properties, thus extends the keeping quality of RSHS upon refrigerated storage.
