However, the appropriate measurement methods and how people actually perceive their food
environments are still unclear. In a cross-sectional study of 939 adults, the perceived
presence of food outlets was compared to the geographic-based presence of outlets within a
participant’s neighborhood, utilizing percent agreement and Kappa statistics.
Perceived presence was based on survey-administered questions, and geographic-based
presence was characterized using 1-, 2-, 3- and 5-mile (1-mile=1.6 km) Euclidean-
and network-based buffers centered on each participant’s residence. Analyses were
also stratified by urban and non-urban designations. Overall, an individual’s
perceived neighborhood food environment was moderately correlated with the
geographic-based presence of outlets. The performance of an individual’s
perception was most optimal using a 2- or 3-mile geographic-based neighborhood boundary
and/or when the participant lived in a non-urban neighborhood. This study has implications
for how researchers measure the food environment.

NeighborhoodFood environmentPerceptionsGISFood outlets
   1. Introduction
It has been suggested that neighborhood food environment, measured either
objectively or subjectively, is associated with dietary intake (Caspi et al. 2012a). To date, geographic information systems (GIS)
have been the most-utilized objective method to characterize neighborhood food environments
(McKinnon et al., 2009; Charreire et al., 2010; Van et al.,
2011; Thornton et al., 2011). However, it is
unknown whether GIS-based measures are the most appropriate means of defining an
individual’s food environment (Caspi et al.,
2012b, 2012a; Mujahid et al., 2007). There are currently no standardized methods for
characterizing a food environment, and thus assessment and development of appropriate food
environment measures is warranted (Caspi et al. 2012b;
Lytle, 2009).

Perception measures based on surveys and self-report have been used increasingly to
characterize food environments (Moore et al., 2008a,
2008b; Sharkey,
2009; McKinnon et al., 2009). Such measures
have included an individual’s perception of the availability of healthy food items
in his/her neighborhood (Moore et al., 2008a, 2008b; Freedman and Bell,
2009; Zenk et al., 2009; Gustafson et al., 2011; Williams et
al., 2011; Moore et al., 2012), as well as
information on the individual’s perceived presence of different retail food outlets
(Zenk et al., 2009; Gustafson et al., 2011; Williams et al.,
2011; Caspi et al., 2012b). In a recent
review by Caspi and colleagues, studies using measures of perceived food environments have
shown significant associations with dietary outcomes (Caspi
et al. 2012a; Sharkey et al. 2010; Moore et al.
2009, 2008b; Inglis et al. 2008), whereas studies utilizing GIS-based measures of retail outlet
presence or density have shown mixed and varying relationships (Caspi et al. 2012b).

Methodological decisions regarding how to define food environments, including
geographic boundaries and contexts, could have a significant role in deciphering
inconsistent findings among studies. Using GIS, food environments have typically been
characterized by geographic “neighborhood” boundaries defined as census
tracts, block groups and/or Euclidean or network buffers centered on some point of reference
(e.g., population-weighted centroids or home addresses) (Charreire et al., 2010; Van Meter et al.,
2011; Thornton et al., 2011). However, the
use of such boundaries has notable limitations, including the modifiable areal unit problem,
which can bias research findings based on the choice (i.e., number, size and shape) of
boundaries for areal units (Openshaw, 1983; Christian, 2012). In addition, one cannot assume that all
individuals conceptualize and/or interact within their environments similarly. For instance,
in neighborhood perception studies utilizing mental maps, researchers found that an
individual’s perceived neighborhood can cover many different spaces and produce
different boundaries based on age, race, class, gender and various other factors (Coulton et al., 2001, 2012). In a recent activity-based food environment study, researchers found that
individuals encountered very different food environments in their daily travels compared to
those located within or near their residential-defined neighborhood (Christian, 2012). Thus, how a person may operationalize and
perceive his/her neighborhood food environment could vary based on that person’s
daily routine and sociodemographic factors.

Despite challenges in defining and characterizing a food environment, only a
handful of studies have examined differences in perceived and objective environments (Caspi et. al., 2012a; Moore et al., 2008a, 2008b, 2012; Zenk et al., 2009;
Gustafson et al., 2011; Williams et al., 2011; Giskes et
al., 2007; Freedman and Bell, 2009). Of
these studies, only two directly compared perceived and GIS-based presence (availability) of
retail food outlets (Caspi et al., 2012a; Williams et al., 2011); the primary focus of these
studies was the identification of traditional food outlets (i.e., supermarkets) within a
pre-specified neighborhood boundary.

In this study, we sought to provide an in-depth comparison of GIS-based and
perceived presence of retail food outlets in a sample of adults living in an eight-county
region of South Carolina. In doing so, we aimed to determine what retail food outlets are
available in an individual’s neighborhood, as defined by field-validated GIS (as the
gold standard), and to what extent individuals are aware of the presence of these food
outlets via survey. Aims of our analyses included: 1) to examine whether the objective
presence of retail food outlets within a standard 1-mile (~1.6 km) buffer used to define an
individual’s GIS-based neighborhood is accurately reflected in the perceived
presence of retail food outlets within a 1-mile or a 20-minute walk from an
individual’s home; 2) to conduct sensitivity analyses by varying defined GIS-based
neighborhoods, utilizing 2-, 3- and 5-mile buffers to examine changes in agreement (i.e.,
percent agreement and Kappa statistics) while keeping the perception buffer the same (1 mile
or a 20-minute walk); and 3) to examine the accuracy between perceived and GIS-based
presence by a sociodemographic factor, specifically urban or non-urban neighborhood
designation.

Findings from this study could contribute to exploring whether measures of
perceived availability of food retail outlets are viable alternative measures to GIS-based
measures in food environment studies. In addition, this work could contribute to refining
methods that researchers and policymakers use to describe a person’s perception of
his/her food environment and whether an individual’s perceptions are adequate to
detect changes in the retail food environment resulting from food access interventions,
policy initiatives and associations with diet and weight outcomes.

2. Methods
This was a cross-sectional, non-experimental research study utilizing survey
responses from 939 primary household food shoppers conducted in the spring of 2010, along
with corresponding GIS-based measures of the respondents’ food environments, within
an eight-county region in South Carolina. This was a supplemental study related to a larger
research effort focused on developing measures of the built nutritional environment (Liese et al., 2010, 2013a) and examining perceptions, shopping behaviors and diet among residents of
the eight-county study region (Ma et al., 2013; Liese et al., 2013b). This study was approved by the
University of South Carolina (USC) Institutional Review Board.

2.1 Study Region
The study area consisted of a contiguous geographical region encompassing eight
counties (seven non-urban and one urban) in South Carolina (Fig. 1). The one urban county, Richland, contains the state capital, Columbia.
The seven non-urban counties (Calhoun, Chester, Clarendon, Fairfield, Kershaw, Lancaster
and Orangeburg) comprised the remaining study area.

2.2 Study Participants
Data collection occurred between April and July of 2010. Recruitment of study
participants was geographically based and was designed to achieve spatial coverage of the
entire study area. Specifically, selection was done through a random selection of landline
telephone numbers with listed addresses restricted to 64 eligible ZIP codes within the
study area, with a goal of 15 respondents per ZIP code. Recruitment calls were made by the
interviewing staff at USC’s Survey Research Laboratory. Respondents were screened
for the eligibility criteria, including being 1) at least 18 years of age, 2) the primary
food shopper of the household, 3) English speaking and 4) living in the eight-county study
area. Of the 2,477 household telephone numbers screened, a total of 968 residents were
eligible and completed the interview; there were 553 refusals, 377 ineligibles and 579
residents of non-contact, unknown or other status. Applying response rate formula 4 as
outlined by the American Association for Public Opinion Research (American Association for Public Opinion Research (AAPOR), 2011),
we estimated a response rate of 47%. The AAPOR is the leading professional
organization of public opinion and survey research, providing standardized definitions and
methodologies for the comparison of response rates for different surveys in the United
States (AAPOR, 2011). Our survey response rate was
very comparable to the 49% rate among landline households that was achieved in a
recent evaluation of the Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System (BRFSS) landline
response rates conducted in 18 US states (Hu et al.,
2011). In our analyses, 11 participants were removed because of missing
perception data, and 18 were removed because of errors in geocoding addresses. The final
analytic sample included 939 participants.

2.3 Perception Measures
Perceived presence of a food retail outlet was obtained using a set of newly
developed, validated questions (Table 1) (Ma et al., 2013). Specifically, participants were asked
“which of the following stores, if any, are located in your neighborhood, defined
as a 1-mile buffer or 20-minute walk around your home?” Stores listed included six
types of retail food outlets, including supermarkets, supercenters, convenience stores,
drug and pharmacy stores, dollar and variety stores and fast food restaurants. Response
options were dichotomous: perceived presence was reported as yes or no. The test-retest
reliability of the questions determined by Phi coefficients ranged from 0.58 for
convenience stores to 0.96 for supermarkets (Ma et al.,
2013). A person’s neighborhood was defined as a 1-mile buffer or
20-minute walk around their home based on validated perception questions published
previously (Moore et al., 2008a, 2008b; Mujahid et al.,
2007). In analyses, supermarkets and supercenters (defined as any large retail
store that sells both groceries and general merchandise, e.g., Wal-Mart or Target) were
aggregated on the basis that supermarkets and supercenters typically represent food
outlets providing access to nutritious food in greater variety and affordability and
higher quality (Franco et al., 2008; Block and Kouba, 2006). This classification was used previously
by the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention in their 2013 State Indicator Report
on Fruits and Vegetables (Centers for Disease Control and
Prevention, 2013).

2.4 GIS-Based Measures
The GIS-based presence of retail food outlets was determined using each
respondent’s home address as the point of reference, with varying (1-, 2-, 3- and
5-mile) Euclidean and street network buffers representing neighborhood boundaries (Fig. 2). The buffers were selected to provide a
reasonable range of distances that could accommodate both sensitivity analyses and any
urban vs. non-urban differences in the presence of retail food outlets. Overall, in our
sample, the average distance to the nearest retail food outlet ranged from 3 to 8 miles.
For urban participants, this average distance ranged from 1 to 2 miles, and for non-urban
participants, it ranged from 3 to 9 miles. Thus, a 1-mile network buffer was selected as
the standard comparison to perception measures, and incremental increases up to 5 miles
were examined. For each outlet type, presence was determined by linking geospatial retail
food environment data that were validated in 2009. Methods for creating the GIS-based
retail food environment dataset have been published elsewhere (Liese et al., 2010, 2013a). Dichotomous variables representing presence (yes or no) for all food
outlet types were created.

Residential addresses were geocoded using address-match geocoding in ArcGIS
Network Analyst 10.0 (ESRI Redlands, CA 2010). Street network data were provided by
StreetMap Premium within ArcGIS. Of the 968 addresses provided, 950 (98.1%) were
matched to a corresponding street address on the street network in ArcGIS and assigned a
location. In addition, a 15-meter side offset was selected to place addresses on the
correct side of the road based on the methods of Cayo and Talbot (Cayo and Talbot, 2003). Eighteen (1.9%) participant
addresses were unmatched. Of these, 5 were PO boxes and 13 had street names that did not
exist in the street network data provided. The participants who provided these addresses
were excluded from analyses.

2.5 Individual Characteristics
Demographic characteristics were determined based on questions from BRFSS (Centers for Disease Control and Prevention BRFSS, 2011)
and included age, sex, race/ethnicity, education, employment status, utilization of the
Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP), marital/partner status and number of
individuals living in the home. Each survey respondent was also classified individually
with respect to urbanicity—urban or non-urban—using the 2010 US
Census–defined urban classification via a point-in-polygon operation within ArcGIS
(United States Census Bureau, 2010).
Specifically, a resident’s home address was geocoded, and the US Census tract in
which their home is located was determined. An urban area was determined as any census
tract classified as either “an urbanized area of 50,000 or more people or an urban
cluster consisting of at least 2,500 and less than 50,000 people.” All census
tracts not designated as urban were considered to be non-urban.

2.6 Statistical Analyses
All statistical analyses were conducted using SAS 9.3 (SAS Institute, Inc.,
Cary, NC, 2012). First, the percent agreement was calculated to represent a basic measure
of the proportion of respondents that accurately perceived the presence or absence of a
food outlet type in their corresponding GIS-based neighborhood food environment when there
was an actual food outlet presence or absence, respectively. Kappa statistics were then
calculated to examine whether the objective GIS-based presence of retail food outlets was
reflected by an individual’s perceptions, after accounting for the effects of
chance agreement alone (Cohen, 1960; Viera and Garrett, 2005).

For all statistics, GIS-based presence was considered the gold standard.
95% confidence intervals (CIs) were calculated for all statistics by approximating
the binomial distribution with a normal distribution. For ease of interpretation of the
Kappa statistic values, the following guidelines as outlined by Landis and Koch and other
studies were used: 0.81–1.00, almost perfect; 0.61–0.80, substantial;
0.41–0.60, moderate; 0.21–0.40, fair; 0–0.20, slight; and &lt;0,
poor (Landis and Koch, 1977; Viera and Garrett, 2005).

When conducting sensitivity analyses, agreement statistics were constructed,
varying by GIS-based neighborhood buffer sizes (i.e., 1-, 2-, 3-, and 5-mile buffers),
while the measure of perceived presence remained at 1 mile (or a 20-minute walk).
Differences between statistics by buffer sizes were then assessed using non-overlapping
CIs. Thus, if the CIs for two statistics did not overlap, the values were considered
significantly different. Finally, the agreement between perceived and GIS-based presence
was compared for individuals living in urban and non-urban neighborhoods. Fisher’s
exact tests were performed to determine differences between groups.

3. Results
Descriptive statistics of the study sample are displayed in Table 2. Of the 939 participants, the majority were female
(79%), non-Hispanic white (67%) and lived in non-urban neighborhoods
(80%). The mean age for all individuals was ~58 years. Twelve percent of
participants did not have a high school diploma, 22% were unemployed, 8%
received SNAP benefits and 65% had a spouse or partner living in the household. On
average, individuals lived with 2.5 household members. Ninety-four percent of all
participants used their own personal vehicle for primary food shopping.

Thirty-two percent of individuals reported having a supermarket in their
neighborhood, defined as a 1-mile buffer around their home, whereas only 19% had a
GIS-verified supermarket within a 1-mile Euclidean-based buffer, and 12% had one
within a 1-mile network-based buffer (Table 3).
Similar discrepancies were observed for convenience stores (54% vs. 36% and
29%, respectively), drug and pharmacy stores (29% vs. 16% and
13%, respectively), dollar and variety stores (39% vs. 22% and
15%, respectively) and franchised fast food restaurants (27% vs. 22%
and 15%, respectively). For all food outlet types, the Euclidean-based buffer was
closer in percentage value to the perceived data as compared to the network-based
buffer.

Participants who had a specific retail food outlet located within 1 mile of their
home were aware of its presence or absence, as indicated by percent agreements ranging from
72% for convenience stores to 86% for fast food restaurants using a
Euclidean-based 1-mile buffer (Table 4). Percent
agreements ranged from 68% to 83% using a network-based 1-mile buffer.
Increasing the buffer size did not result in any significant changes in percent agreement
using either Euclidean- or network-based buffers. Thus, there seemed to be no advantage in
comparing the perceived survey results to a larger GIS-based neighborhood buffer size. Kappa
values ranged from 0.44 (moderate agreement) for convenience stores to 0.61 (substantial
agreement) for fast food restaurants using a 1-mile Euclidean-based buffer. Kappa values
were lower when using a 1-mile network-based buffer, ranging from 0.35 (fair agreement) for
dollar and variety stores to 0.50 (moderate agreement) for fast food restaurants. In
addition, the Kappa statistic for the presence of supermarkets was significantly lower when
using a 1-mile network-based buffer (0.38, fair agreement) compared to a 1-mile
Euclidean-based buffer (0.52, moderate agreement).

When using different GIS-based neighborhood buffer sizes (i.e., 2-, 3- and 5-mile)
as objective measures of presence, there were some statistically significant differences
between Kappa values compared to the standard 1-mile Euclidean- or network-based
neighborhood buffer sizes (Table 4). Specifically,
agreement for the presence of a supermarket, drug and pharmacy store or dollar and variety
store was significantly higher when using either the 2- or 3-mile network-based buffer sizes
compared to the 1-mile network-based buffer, indicating that the 1-mile buffer may
underestimate a participant’s perceived neighborhood. In addition, agreement for the
presence of a fast food restaurant was significantly higher when using the 2-mile
network-based buffer compared to the 1-mile buffer.

We also noted that the measures of agreement for the 3- and 5-mile buffers were
significantly lower than those for the 1-mile Euclidean- and network-based buffers. However,
this decrease in agreement is most likely due to the inevitable increase in the number of
stores introduced mathematically into the denominator when calculating agreement statistics
for much larger GIS-based buffer sizes. Thus, these findings are not necessarily comparable
to the 1-mile buffer size after a certain mathematical threshold.

Finally, agreement was examined by stratifying participants by urban or non-urban
designation (Table 5). Overall, the percent agreement
was significantly lower for supermarkets and dollar and variety stores in urban participants
compared to non-urban participants using either 1-mile Euclidean- or network-based buffers.
In addition, the percent agreement was significantly lower for drug and pharmacy stores and
fast food restaurants in urban participants compared to non-urban participants using a
1-mile network-based buffer. However, there were few significant differences between urban
and non-urban participants when examining Kappa values, as only the agreement for drug and
pharmacy stores differed significantly using either Euclidean- or network-based buffers,
indicating a significantly lower agreement in non-urban participants compared to urban
participants. Lastly, urban participants had a significantly lower chance-adjusted agreement
for dollar and variety stores compared to non-urban participants using the network-based
buffer.

4. Discussion
In this study, we examined the relationship between perceived and GIS-based
presence of retail food outlets in a sample of adults living in South Carolina. Overall, an
individual’s perception of the presence or absence of a food store located within 1
mile of his/her home was moderately agreeable with objective, GIS-based measures of food
outlet presence. Kappa values ranged from 0.44 to 0.61 when comparing a
participant’s perceived presence of food outlets to the GIS-based presence of food
outlets using a 1-mile Euclidean-based neighborhood buffer and 0.35 to 0.50 using a 1-mile
network-based buffer.

Our findings also suggest that the performance of an individual’s
perceptions was most optimal when using a 2- or 3-mile geographic-based neighborhood
boundary. Kappa values for comparisons of these perceptions to standard 1-mile Euclidean- or
network-based neighborhood buffer sizes were significantly higher for supermarkets, drug and
pharmacy stores and dollar and variety stores when using either 2- or 3-mile network-based
buffer sizes compared to a 1-mile network-based buffer. In addition, the agreement for fast
food restaurants was significantly higher using the 2-mile network-based buffer. These
findings suggest that researchers should consider the neighborhood boundaries selected as a
reference in food environment measures. Although Euclidean-based measures were not
significantly different, when analyzing network-based measures, researchers should consider
the most appropriate boundary size: it could be that a 1-mile network-based buffer does not
necessarily best characterize a participant’s perceived neighborhood.

To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study to explore the impact of
varying neighborhood buffer sizes on the relationship between perceived and actual presence
of various types of food outlets. However, we do not wish to overstate the contribution of
our findings, as we did not have varied neighborhood boundaries when administrating the
perception questionnaire. A future study comparing both perceived and GIS-based measures and
utilizing varied neighborhood boundaries would be ideal.

Agreement statistics also differed significantly when considering urbanicity.
Specifically, the percent agreement was significantly lower for supermarkets and dollar and
variety stores in urban participants compared to non-urban participants using either 1-mile
Euclidean- or network-based buffers. In addition, the percent agreement was significantly
lower for drug and pharmacy stores and fast food restaurants in urban participants using a
1-mile network-based buffer. However, given that we observed few significant differences by
urbanicity after accounting for chance agreement via Kappa statistics, this finding suggests
that for supermarkets, convenience stores and franchised fast food outlets, residents of
urban and non-urban areas do not differ substantially in terms of their reported
agreement.

Two recent studies compared perceived and GIS-based presence of food outlets
(Williams et al., 2011; Caspi et al., 2012b). In a sample of women aged 18–65 years
in Melbourne, Australia, Williams et al. found that the match (percent agreement) between
perceived and objective food environments was poor, reporting that approximately 50%
of women had accurate reports between their perceptions and objective measures of
supermarket presence within 800 m (~0.5 miles) of their home (Williams et al., 2011). For fast food stores, this agreement was
only 40%. This outcome is much different than that in our study, where we report
percent agreements of 78% using a 1-mile network-based buffer size and 82%
using a 1-mile Euclidean-based buffer. Possible discrepancies between our results and those
of Williams et al. may be traced to the nature of the perception questions used and the
choice of GIS-based measure. In our study, we asked study participants to think of their
neighborhood environment specifically as a 1-mile buffer or 20-minute walk around their
home, whereas participants in the study by Williams et al. were asked “are the
following within walking distance of your home?” without any guide to what is meant
by walking distance. Moreover, Williams et al. classified participants via GIS as having or
not having each type of store nearby using an 800-m (~0.5-mile) definition for walkable
distance.

In another study, Caspi et al. reported that 69% of residents matched, via
percent agreement, between objective and perceived presence of a supermarket within 1
kilometer (~0.6 miles) in a sample of low-income housing residents in three urban areas in
the greater Boston area. This may suggest that Caspi et al. used a buffer size that was too
small to optimize concordance between a person’s perceived and objectively measured
food environment. Moreover, Caspi et al. chose their cut point for a neighborhood buffer at
1 kilometer because the researchers were concerned about artificially high levels of
discordance based on previous buffers used in the literature and because most of their
participants reported a supermarket within walking distance (Caspi, Kawachi, Subramanian, Adamkiewicz, &amp; Sorensen 2012a). It is important
to point out, however, that in our study, the majority of food shoppers traveled by car
(&gt;90%) and did not walk to food outlets, even in urban
neighborhoods.

Our study contributes to food environment research by not only exploring the
agreement between an individual’s perceived and actual presence of supermarkets and
other food retail outlets but also examining how this relationship changes using different
boundaries to define a person’s neighborhood. It could be that the Williams et al.
and Caspi et al. studies using smaller cut points to define a person’s neighborhood
may have affected the relationship between perception and the GIS-based environment. In our
study, we found slight improvement, via significant increases in Kappa statistics, when
increasing the network-based neighborhood definition from the 1-mile to the 2- or 3-mile
buffer sizes. It is possible that individuals are not able to mentally conceptualize the
extent of a 1-mile buffer around their home based on personal and behavioral factors. Thus,
additional studies are needed that vary the spatial frame of the perception questions (i.e.,
2 miles, 3 miles, etc.) and subsequently compare respondents’ perceptions with
validated GIS-based measures with the same buffers as those used in the perception
questions.

Our study has several limitations. First, women constituted the majority of the
sample because we selected the primary food shopper of the household. This may limit the
generalizability of our findings. Second, our landline-based telephone sample yielded an age
distribution with an average age in the middle-to-older category, which does not represent
all residents. Third, the perception data were collected nearly 1 year after the completion
of the validated field census. However, it should be noted that this time gap between data
collection is comparable to those reported in other similar studies (Moore et al., 2008a; Gustafson et
al., 2011).

Strengths of the study included the use of a set of reliable food environment
questions examining the perceived presence of various types of food outlets (Ma et al., 2013). Reliability ranged from 0.58 to 0.96 in a
test-retest analysis (Ma et al., 2013). Secondly, our
measure of GIS-based presence was based on a validated field census of our study region
(Liese et al., 2010, 2013a). In addition, our study area contained both urban and
non-urban communities. Thus, these findings may be beneficial and comparable to new studies
examining populations in the southeastern United States, where there is a mix of urban and
non-urban neighborhoods. Williams et al. and Caspi et al. both examined residents living in
urban communities only.

5. Conclusions
GIS is an important and useful tool for describing a food environment and relating
this environment to an individual’s diet, weight status and neighborhood
characteristics; however, measures based on GIS are susceptible to a number of errors and
inaccuracies (Liese et al., 2010, 2013a; Powell et al., 2011;
Forsyth et al., 2010). This susceptibility is due
partially to the fact that few datasets and resources have been conceived with the sole
purpose of capturing food outlet access. Moreover, the effort to validate commercial and
secondary datasets is often not feasible because of a lack of resources and the expense of
research staff traveling into the field (Forsyth et al.,
2010). There is debate as to whether it may be more economical and accurate to
utilize perceptions measures, either alone or in tandem with GIS-based measurements (Moore et al., 2008a; Caspi
et al., 2012a). For studies that are still in the planning stage, our results could
suggest that a simple survey question alone may be advantageous, thereby saving a study team
the effort of lengthy data cleaning and merging, ground truthing and/or GIS analyses.
Moreover, our study demonstrates there is a moderate correspondence between what retail food
outlets an individual perceives in his/her neighborhood compared to what is actually
present, especially in terms of supermarkets. However, our study also points out that there
is still room to evaluate appropriate neighborhood boundaries for both GIS-based and
perceived presence of retail food outlets. More evidence is needed to determine whether to
rely on perception-based measures of retail food outlets exclusively.

Highlights
Individuals moderately perceived the presence of food outlets in their
neighborhood

Agreement statistics were affected by neighborhood boundaries and
urbanicity

Neighborhood boundaries should be considered in future food environment
measures
