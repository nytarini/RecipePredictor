known Chinese ethnic dishes and is
characterized by crispy skin and tender meat (Chen et
al., 2009). Generally, the tender meat is formed by the denaturation,
aggregation and gelation of proteins under the heating. Myosin is the most abundant
and important protein for the tenderization of roasted duck myofibrils (Guo et al., 2017). The properties of
myofibrillar proteins, especially myosin, play a crucial part in all technological
processes involving heat treatments (Zhou et al.,
2014; Zhou et al., 2018). Previous
studies have focused on the thermal gelation in pork, chicken and rabbit (An et al., 2018; Brewer et al., 2005; Chin et al.,
2009; Xue et al., 2018). The
properties of myosin gels have been widely studied with regard to different parts of
the animal, animal breeds and ionic strengths (Hollung et al., 2014; Xue et al.,
2018), but the age has been minimally researched.
      A previous paper (Cross et al., 1972) has
reported that the tenderness of roasted sheep fore legs has a significantly negative
correlation with chronological age. With the feeding days, there will be changes in
the types and contents of flavor substances in poultry meat (Liu et al., 2013), which will influence meat quality such as
colour, flavor and texture due to different ages of muscles. As the raw material of
Beijing roasted ducks, the Beijing ducks are usually slaughtered at 22 to 45 days.
The myosin protein isoforms changed during growth, which affected their thermal
stability and gel quality. The thermal stability and gel properties of myosin affect
the texture and water retention of duck meat. However, few studies have focused on
the myosin gelation properties of duck meat in relation to age. The effects of age
on the meat tenderness in other breeds of livestock and poultry meat have been
studied (D&#x2019;Alessandro et al., 2019;
Jaborek et al., 2018; Polidori et al., 2017), but how the thermal
stability of myosin in Beijing duck affects the texture of the gel has not been
studied.
      The main objective of the present study was to investigate the properties of myosin
gel extracted from Beijing duck meat samples at several common ages, by measuring
the gel properties, secondary structure changes and chemical reactions that occur
during heating, in order to furtherly understand the role and underlying mechanism
of myosin gel, supplying the best choice of raw Beijing duck meat.

      Materials and Methods

        Sampling and pretreatment
        Beijing ducks were raised at Dong Feng (Hebei, China) under the same conditions,
and feed and water were available at all times. During their rearing, six male
ducks were chosen randomly at 22 (1.14&#xB1;0.13 kg), 30 (1.79&#xB1;0.17
kg), 38 (2.54&#xB1;0.25 kg) and 46 days (2.99&#xB1;0.25 kg). Ducks of the
same age were slaughtered at Dong Feng (Hebei, China). After slaughtering, both
breasts were rapidly removed, trimmed of visible fat and connective tissues, and
snap-frozen with liquid nitrogen immediately. All the samples were transported
to the laboratory in an ice box and stored at &#x2212;80&#xB0;C till use.

        Extraction of myosin
        The extraction of myosin was according to the literature (Han et al., 2015; Pan et
al., 2017) with some modifications. All steps of the extraction were
taken at 4&#xB0;C. The minced meat samples (300 g) were mixed with 1,500 mL
cold buffer (0.1 M Tris-HCl, 20 mM EDTA, pH 7.0) and homogenized twice. And
then, the mixture was centrifuged at 3,000&#xD7;g (10 min, 4&#xB0;C), and
the precipitates were resuspended three times with homogenizer (Ultra-Turrax
T25, IKA, Staufen, Germany) in three volumes of buffer A (0.1 M KCl, 0.02 M
KH2PO4/K2HPO4, 1 mM EGTA and 2
mM MgCl2, pH 7.0). Then, the material was centrifuged at
6,000&#xD7;g for 10 min and the supernatants were diluted with nine volumes of
cold distilled water and precipitated at 4&#xB0;C overnight. After the
supernatant was removed via syphon, the precipitates were centrifugated at
12,000&#xD7;g for 12 min and resuspended with 3 volumes of 0.1 M KCl (pH 7.0),
which was followed by centrifugation (1,500&#xD7;g for 10 min). Afterwards,
the precipitates were resuspended in 0.6 M KCl-phosphate buffer (0.15 M
KH2PO4/K2HPO4, pH 6.5) and
stirred for 30 min slightly.
        The protein concentration was measured by Pierce BCA Protein Assay Kit (Thermo
Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA, USA). The final protein concentration was
adjusted to 15 mg/mL using the 0.6 M KCl buffer (pH 6.5), and the solution was
stored at 4&#xB0;C until further testing.

        Preparation of the myosin gels
        The myosin solutions were placed in 10 mL beakers (Shubo Company, Chengdu, China)
and heated in a water bath (Ronghua Company, Jintan, China) from 25&#xB0;C to
80&#xB0;C at the rate of 1&#xB0;C/min and then incubated at 80&#xB0;C for
20 min. Afterwards, the beakers were immediately cooled in the ice and stored at
4&#xB0;C overnight before the tests were made.

        Water holding capacity measurement
        Centrifugation was used to analyze the WHC (%) based on the method
developed by Pan et al. (2017) with a
slight modification. Each gel was centrifuged at 10,000&#xD7;g for 10 min at
room temperature. The WHC was expressed as a percentage of gel weight after
centrifugation to the initial gel sample weight. The experiments were conducted
in triplicate.

        Gel strength measurement
        The strength of the gels was analyzed using a TA-XT plus Texture Analyzer (Stable
Micro Systems, Godalming, UK) according to the method described by Kotwaliwale et al. (2007) with a slight
modification. The samples (10 mm in diameter, 10 mm in height) were compressed
using a probe (P50) with a distance of 50% the initial height and 0.05 N
trigger force. The pre-test speed was set to 2.0 mm/s, and the test speed and
post-test speed were 1.0 mm/s. The experiments were conducted in six
replicates.

        Differential scanning calorimetry measurement
        The thermal stability of myosin was determined by differential scanning
calorimetry (DSC) using Q200 controlled by a Texture Analysis 5000 system (TA
Instruments, New Castle, DE, USA). Each sample (15 mg) was hermetically sealed
in an aluminum pan and heated from 20&#xB0;C to 90&#xB0;C with 5&#xB0;C
/min scan rate. An empty pan was used as the reference. The transition
temperatures (Tmax) were recorded.

        Surface hydrophobicity measurement
        The surface hydrophobicity was measured as described by Yongsawatdigul and Sinsuwan (2007) with some modifications,
using 8-anilino-1-naphthalene sulfonate (ANS) as the fluorescent probe. The
myosin solutions were diluted to 0.125, 0.25, 0.5, and 1.0 mg/mL. Subsequently,
10 &#x3BC;L of 8.0 mM ANS solution (dissolved in 0.01 M Tris-HCl, pH 7.0) was
added to 2 mL of the myosin samples, and the resulting samples were kept in the
dark at room temperature for 10 min. The fluorescence was determined with a
luminescence spectrophotometer using an excitation wavelength of 374 nm and
emission wavelength of 485 nm. The surface hydrophobicity was expressed as the
initial slope of the fluorescence intensity against the protein concentration
(Excel 2003; Microsoft, Redmond, WA, USA).

        LF-NMR spin-spin relaxation time (T2) measurement
        The LF-NMR spin&#x2013;spin relaxation time (T2) measurements were
examined according to the method of Han et al.
(2009) using an NMR-NMI20 (Niumag, Shanghai, China) system operated
at 22 MHz. Two grams samples were placed in glass tubes. Transverse relaxation
(T2) was measured with 64 scan repetitions, 10,000 echoes, 6,000
ms between scans, and 300 ms between pulses of 90&#xB0; and 180&#xB0;. All
treatments were run in triplicate and the tata were collected.

        Circular dichroism spectroscopy measurement
        The secondary structure of the samples was determined as described previously
(Liu and Zhong, 2013) using an MOS
500 spectrophotometer (Bio-Logic, Claix, France). The heated samples were
adjusted to 0.1 mg/mL and placed in a quartz absorption cell with a 0.01 cm
optical path length. The spectra of the myosin samples were recorded at
25&#xB0;C and from 190 to 250 nm at a scanning speed of 100 nm/min, and the
scanning interval time was 2 s. Circular dichroism (CD) is represented by the
average residue ellipticity [&#x3B8;] (deg&#xB7;cm2/dmol).
Dicroprot software package (IBCP, Lyon cedex, France) was used to calculate the
percentage content of the myosin secondary structure automatically.

        Scanning electron microscopy measurement
        A scanning electron microscope (SEM) was used to observe the microstructures of
the myosin gel. The gel samples were pre-treated according to the method
described by Ma et al. (2012). The gels
were were dehydrated in a series of ethanol ratios (30%, 50%,
70%, 90%, 95%, and 100%) and then freeze-dried and
coated with gold. Finally, a SEM were used with an accelerating voltage of 15
kV.

        Statistical analysis
        The data were analyzed using program of SPSS statistics 23.0 (SPSS, Chicago, IL,
USA). The ages (22, 30, 38, and 46 days) were considered as fixed variables, and
the duck breast muscles for each age were the random effect. The data were
subjected to one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) followed by Duncan's multiple
range test to determine the statistical difference. Pearson correlations were
performed to investigate the relationship among the chemical and histological
values, WHC and gel strength. The results were presented as the means&#xB1;SD.
Significant differences among the mean values were determined at a level of
p&lt;0.05.

      Results

        Effect of age on gel water holding capacity
        The WHC is one of the most important functional properties of a gel system and is
used to indicate a gel&#x2019;s ability to bind water (Yao et al., 2018). As compared to 22-day-old sample, the
WHC of the myosin gel extracted from the 30-day-old sample increased
significantly (p&lt;0.05) from 43.77% to 45.71% and then
decreased at 38 days (p&lt;0.05) (Fig.
1). However, no difference in the WHC was detected for the samples of
22, 38, and 46 days (p&gt;0.05).

            a,b Means with different letters on the bars are significantly

        Effect of age on gel strength
        As an important indicator, the gel strength of proteins were generally used to
assess food texture (Foegeding et al.,
1986). The gel strength of the myosin gel obtained from various ages
of ducks is presented in Fig. 2. Initially,
the gel strength significantly increased for duck breasts obtained at ages
ranging from 22 to 30 days (p&lt;0.05), which was followed by an extreme
decrease for the 38-day-old duck breast (54.00 g). However, the gel strength of
46-day-old samples increased again and was similar to that of the 22-day-old
groups (p&gt;0.05). Thus, an age of 30 days resulted in the best gel
strength (72.56 g).

        Effect of age on gel LF-NMR T2 relaxation time and
proportion
        Table 1 shows the T2 relaxation
time (ms) and proportion (%) of each relaxation component of the myosin
gels extracted from different aged duck breasts. For T22, the
relaxation peak decreased from 510.50 ms (22 days) to 377.41 ms (30 days), then
increased to 500.52 ms (38 days), and finally decreased to 390.56 (46 days),
which further reflected a more compact network structure that limited the water
migration in the gel matrix. The proportion of T22 for the 22-day-old
sample was significantly lower than that of the 30-day-old sample
(p&lt;0.05). There was no significant difference in the proportions of
T22 among the samples obtained from the duck breasts aged for 30,
38, and 46 days (p&gt;0.05), but the T22 proportion of the
30-day-old sample is larger than that of the other groups.

        Effect of age on gel microstructure
        The microstructures of the myosin gel extracted from the duck breasts of
different ages are illustrated in Fig. 3.
As shown in Fig. 3B, the three-dimensional
network structure of the myosin gel from the 30-day-old duck breast was more
compact and fine compared to that of the other groups, which formed smooth,
continuous and high-density protein gel matrices. The microstructure of the
myosin gel obtained from the 38- and 46-day-old duck breasts had rougher
appearances and more disordered gel matrices (Fig.
3C and D). The microstructure of the 22-day-old myosin gel had a
disordered structure with large cavities or voids. The result suggested that age
influences the connectivity of the protein strands in the gel network, in which
the alignment or aggregation of the proteins was augmented.

        Effect of age on myosin differential scanning calorimetry
        The temperatures of denaturation of the myosin were presented in Table 2. There were two absorption peaks,
with one occurring at approximately 45&#xB0;C and the other at 56&#xB0;C,
and these peaks corresponded to the denaturation of the head and tail,
respectively. Table 2 showed that there
was no significant effect on the Tmax1 of myosin (p&gt;0.05),
while the Tmax2 of both the myosin extracted from 30- and 38-day-old
duck breast is significantly higher than that of 22-day-old sample
(p&lt;0.05).

        Effect of age on myosin surface hydrophobicity
        The protein surface hydrophobicity was used to evaluate the denaturation degree
of proteins, which reflected the relative content of hydrophobic amino acids on
the surface of protein molecules (Chelh et al.,
2006). As shown in Fig. 4, as
the heating temperature was increased, the relative fluorescence intensity of
myosin first slightly increased from 25&#xB0;C to 50&#xB0;C and then rapidly
decreased from 50&#xB0;C to 70&#xB0;C (p&lt;0.05); after 70&#xB0;C was
reached, the surface hydrophobicity was stable (p&gt;0.05).

          Fig. 4.

            Surface hydrophobicity of myosin during heating.
            The myosin was from 4 ages duck: 22, 30, 38, and 46 days. The heating
temperature is from 25&#xB0;C to 100&#xB0;C, 4&#xB0;C as control.
Different letters between temperatures are significantly different
(p&lt;0.05).

        Effect of age on myosin chemical force
        Table 3 shows the content of the chemical
forces of the myosin extracted from different ages of duck breast and heated at
80&#xB0;C. The content of hydrogen bonds in the myosin obtained from a
30-day-old duck breast was 0.36&#xB1;0.04, which is significantly lower than
that of the duck breasts of other ages. Ionic bonds are the main force that
maintains the natural structure of myosin, but heating can break the ionic bonds
between protein molecules, leading to protein aggregation and gelation.
Moreover, the content of disulfide bonds in myosin extracted from 30-day-old
duck meat was significantly higher than that of the others (Table 3).

        Effect of age on myosin secondary structure
        CD is a common method used to study the secondary structure of proteins. As seen
in Fig. 5, the protein in the myosin gel is
dominated by an &#x3B1;-helix structure. As the heating temperature gradually
increases, the content of &#x3B1;-helices in the myosin gels obtained from duck
breasts of all ages decreases gradually, and the rate of decline is the largest
in the range of 40&#xB0;C&#x2013;70&#xB0;C, indicating that this is the
temperature range in which the myosin secondary structure is most sensitive to
changes. The content of &#x3B1;-helices decreased from 94.81%
(25&#xB0;C) before heating to 16.73% at 100&#xB0;C, indicating that
the myosin tail gradually extended with the increase of the temperature, and the
protein molecules unfolded. Neighboring myosin molecules entangle with each
other, resulting in the aggregation of proteins and the formation of large
myosin aggregates. The frequency of &#x3B2;-folding and irregular curling
increased significantly. When heated to the gel formation temperature
(80&#xB0;C), the &#x3B1;-helix structure content of the samples obtained from
the 22-day-old duck was significantly higher than that of other days of age.

          Fig. 5.

Beijing duck breasts with different ages (22, 30, 38, and 46
days).

        Correlation analysis
        Table 4 shows the correlation coefficients
for the chemical and histological values, WHC and gel strength. The WHC of the
myosin gel was negatively related to the T2 relaxation time
(R=&#x2212;0.97) and surface hydrophobicity
(R=&#x2212;0.99) while positively associated
(R=0.98) with the ionic bonds. The ionic bonds were
negatively related to the T2 relaxation time
(R=&#x2212;0.96) and surface hydrophobicity
(R=&#x2212;0.97). However, there was no correlation
found between the gel strength and the other parameters. Differences in the
populations involved or the portions of the population sampled probably explain
these differences in magnitude and/or direction of the assumed

      Discussion

        The thermal stability of myosin varied with increasing age
        The result of DSC showed that the myosin extracted from both the 30- and
38-day-old breast is more stable than that extracted from duck breasts of other
ages. The stability, morphological structure and functional properties of the
protein had a great effect on the hydrophobic properties. In this study, the
surface hydrophobicity increased from 25&#xB0;C to 55&#xB0;C, and continued
heating lead surface hydrophobicity to decrease, which is similar to
Promeyrat&#x2019;s report (Promeyrat et al.,
2010). This change was due to the hydrophobic side chains of the
protein, which were exposed to the water environment and caused protein
aggregation, the formation of disulfide bonds. And then hydrophobic groups
embedded within the myosin, so that the surface hydrophobicity decreased. The
surface hydrophobicity (ANS-S0) of the myosin extracted from
different ages of duck reached its maximum value at different temperature
points. The myosin ANS-S0 of the 22- and 38-day-old duck reached a
maximum value at 45&#xB0;C. At 46 days old, ANS-S0 reached its
maximum value at 50&#xB0;C, while at 30 days old, ANS-S0 reached
its maximum value at 55&#xB0;C. The release of myosin light chain may be the
reason for the increase of surface hydrophobicity during heating, forming
hydrophobic patches at the head-head interactions of myosin heads that occurred
at 40&#xB0;C (Sharp and Offer,
1992).
        With regard to the secondary structure displayed in Fig. 4, the content of &#x3B1;-helices presented between 4&#xB0;C
and 40&#xB0;C stabilized at approximately 100% or 94% for
myosin, but decreased immediately upon heating from 40&#xB0;C to 80&#xB0;C
and remained stable at 12% for temperatures greater than 80&#xB0;C,
which was obtained from 38- and 46-day-old duck breast. This result implied that
the myosin rod containing abundant &#x3B1;-helical structures did not
participate in the aggregation under 40&#xB0;C. The content of &#x3B2;-sheets
increased as the temperature ascended from 25&#xB0;C to 100&#xB0;C. From
40&#xB0;C to 70&#xB0;C, it had a significant change from approximately
0% to 15%. When the temperatures reached above 80&#xB0;C, the
content of &#x3B2;-sheets only increased slightly but not significantly. The
content of random coils increased during heating, and the increase in the area
occurred mainly in the temperature range from 40&#xB0;C to 80&#xB0;C. Many
studies have found that in the process of heat-induced formation of myosin gel,
there is a widespread decrease in the content of &#x3B1;-helix and increase of
the content of &#x3B2;-sheet and random coil (Li-Chan and Nakai, 1991). Liu et al.
(2008) studied the variations in the myosin secondary structure
extracted from porcine and concluded that the &#x3B1;-helix content reduced
from 90% to 40% during heating, while the &#x3B2;-sheet content
increased nonlinearly (Liu et al., 2008).
Xu et al. (2011) explored the process
of heat-induced gel of pork myofibrillar proteins, and the results had a similar
tendency, which was consistent with our study.

        The WHC of myosin is regulated by molecular interaction and microstructure
with increased age
        The correlation coefficients exposed that the WHC of the myosin gel was
negatively related to the T2 relaxation time (p&lt;0.05) and
surface hydrophobicity (p&lt;0.01) and positively associated (p&lt;0.05)
with the ionic bonds. As all knows, the WHC of a gel is closely relevant to the
morphology of the matrix and cavity in the three-dimensional network, as well as
the interactions between protein and water that existed in the gel matrix (Han et al., 2014). Water will be entrapped
in the gel network as a result of the protein cross-linking and aggregation
during gelling (Tintchev et al., 2013).
In addition, the fine gel microstructure was conducive to the stability of the
immobilized and bound water.
        Compared to the other samples, the results showed that the myosin extracted from
the 30- and 46-day-old duck breasts had significantly smaller T22
values (p&lt;0.05) and higher proportions of T22, which were
meant that these samples contained more bound water and were stable during
transformation. It has been proposed that myosin heavy chains (MHC) have various
properties when derived from different types of muscle (Lopez-Diaz et al., 2003). It was generally believed that
the ability of MHCs to cross-link depended on the location of the MHC in one or
more specific sites of myosin, and any structural or functional differences in
these sites would result in different gel properties from different fish myosin
(Chan et al., 1993).
        The structure and physicochemical properties of gelation depended on the relative
rates of protein denaturation and aggregation. With the increase in temperature,
the &#x3B1;-helix content in myosin decreased gradually, while the
&#x3B2;-sheet content tended to increase. The loss of &#x3B1;-helical
structures possibly lead to the exposure of active groups such as hydrophobic
and sulfhydryl groups, resulting in temperature induced cross-linking, and
shaped a three-dimensional network capable of retain water. When heated to
80&#xB0;C, more &#x3B1;-helices were removed, leading to the space between
the molecules becoming smaller and reducing the space available to retain water
and reducing water retention. Moreover, the content of disulfide bonds in myosin
obtained from 30-day-old duck meat was significantly higher than that of the
others (Table 3), which is the main
covalent bond that forms during heat-induced protein gelation. Thus, the higher
content of &#x3B2;-sheets and disulfide bonds from 30-day-old duck resulted in
higher gel WHC.
        The finer network with more protein cross-linking was associated to the increased
WHC, as indicated by the higher WHC (Fig.
2). Chantrapornchai and Mcclements
(2002) reported that fine-stranded networks with comparatively small
pores had high WHC, while the particulate networks containing relatively large
pores had low WHC (Chantrapornchai and
Mcclements, 2002). Joachim and
Koehler (2005) also reported that the microstructure was determined
by the spreading of the water relaxation times: the low relaxation time was
closely related to the fine gel microstructure. The T22 relaxation
time for the gel obtained from 30-day-old duck meat was significantly lower than
that of the 20 and 38-day-old duck meat (p&lt;0.05), demonstrating that the
water binding degree in the protein network structure was increased at this age,
which could be concluded by the size of the pores and the aggregation state of
the gel structure. The latter gel was denser and more uniform, with smaller
pores which possess stronger interaction with water in the gel.

        The gel strength of myosin, as regulated by the molecular interactions and
microstructure with increased ages
        A higher gel strength was associated with an increased breaking force, and a more
rigid gel was the result of a denser network (Buamard and Benjakul, 2015). Myosin gels were supported by a network
structure that was composed of S&#x2013;S and hydrophobic bonds that formed as a
consequence of heating, and with the increased in the moisture content, the
covalent bonds could not be damaged easily by heating; therefore, the network
structure also could not be readily broken. As the increase in the denaturation
degree of protein, the hydrophobic groups exposed more, and protein molecules
aggregated in a gel matrix by enhancing the interactions of the proteins.
Considering the endpoint temperature (80&#xB0;C) of the gel, the content of
disulfide bonds in the myosin obtained from 30-day-old duck meat was notably
higher as compared to the myosin obtained from the other age of duck meat
(p&lt;0.05), indicating that myosin formed more disulfide bonds at this
temperature, making proteins bound more tightly. During the process of protein
thermal denaturation, there more hydrophobic groups and sulfhydryl groups
exposed. The exposed hydrophobic groups were grouped by their surface
hydrophobicity, and the sulfhydryl groups linked to each other to form disulfide
bonds. These interactions contributed to the formation of gel networks.
        The higher &#x3B1;-helix content which are rich in sulfhydryl group, was higher
in myosin tail than that of myosin head region. With the increase in
temperature, the myosin tail region might be destroyed, and lentigo maligna
melanoma (LMM) might deform, which caused &#x3B1;-helices lessening. Then, the
interaction between the hydrophobic groups in the tail of the myosin promotes
the formation of the network. In the previous studies it was noted that the
damage of &#x3B1;-helices is interrelated to the unfolding of myosin, as
determined by a study on different types of fish myosin (Chan et al., 1992). Nevertheless, it has been proposed that
the development of the &#x3B2;-sheet structure might be an essential for the
accumulation of cross-linked gel network with strong hydrogen bonding among
molecules at high temperature, leading to the irreversible aggregation of
proteins and the maintenance of the gel network (Han et al., 2015). Even though the temperature did not alter the
content of secondary structure of myosin gel whereas, some of the secondary
protein structures it can possibly vary (Sanchez-Gonzalez et al., 2008). When heated to the gel formation
temperature (80&#xB0;C), the &#x3B1;-helix content in the sample derived from
the 22-day-old duck meat is significantly higher than that of the samples
obtained from the other ages of duck meat, which indicated that the myosin
aggregation degree is weak, and the formation of a network structure in the
sample obtained from the 22-day-old duck meat was inferior to those of the other
samples.

      Conclusion
      Present study demonstrated that the thermal stability was significantly improved for
30-day-old duck breast, while which myosin gel had a compact and ordered
three-dimensional network structure with small and regular cavities. Overall, myosin
gels obtained from the 30-day-old duck breast had better properties than the gels
obtained from the other ages&#x2019; duck breasts, which can be considered as the
selection criteria for the raw material of Beijing roasted ducks.
