teins, lipids, vitamins, and minerals;
however, the quality of nutritional components of meats and meat products may be
reduced by chemical substances and microorganisms (Devatkal et al., 2014). Lipid oxidation in meats can result in
deterioration of meat quality, and the extent of deterioration is determined by
chemical factors, such as the type of meat and oxygen content, and storage
temperature (Kanner, 1994). Furthermore,
because lipid oxidation affects the sensory quality of meat, including color,
texture, and flavor, it also undermines the quality and consumer acceptability of
meat products (Johnson and Decker, 2015). To
prevent lipid oxidation, synthetic antioxidants, such as ascorbic acid, butylated
hydroxyanisol, butylated hydroxytoluene, tert-butylhydroquinone, prophylgallate,
nitrates, and nitrites, are added during meat production (Ribeiro et al., 2019; Shah et
al., 2014). However, consumers have become increasingly concerned about
the addition of synthetic antioxidants in processed meat products (Han and Ahn, 1998), which has instigated the
use of natural antioxidants extracted from plants (Gil et al., 2001; Shah et al.,
2014).
      Natural antioxidants extracted from plants rich in phytochemicals (e.g., polyphenols,
flavonoids) have been used to suppress lipid oxidation and improve quality
characteristics of various meat products; indeed, the use of phytochemical-rich
plant extracts has prolonged the shelf life of meat products and enhanced their
quality (Mancini et al., 2015; Misumoto et al., 2005; Zhang et al., 2017). Experiments have been conducted using
sausages containing curcumin extracts (Kim et al.,
2007), pork patties containing brown soybean ethanolic extracts (Lee et al., 2016) and coffee extracts (Lise et
al., 2004), Chinese-style sausages containing clove extracts (Zhang et al., 2017), and meat products containing rosemary
extracts (Jin et al., 2016; Martinez et al.,
2016) and green tea extracts (Mitsumoto et al.,
2005; Ozvural et al., 2016).
      Cacao (Theobroma cacao L.), the raw material used for making
chocolate, is rich in phenolic compounds that can suppress lipid oxidation in meats.
Cacao has been shown to reduce the risk of cardiovascular disease-related mortality
and has antioxidant and antibacterial effects (Djouss et al., 2011; Ferrazzano et al.,
2009; Lotito and Frei, 2006).
Cacao nibs are peeled cacao beans that are used for preparing cocoa powder, cocoa
butter, and chocolate products (Campos-Vega et al.,
2018). Cacao extracts are a rich source of falvan-3-ols, such as
catechins and epicatechins, and contain procyanidine and quercetin glycosides (Lamuela-Raventos et al., 2013; Sanchez-Rabaneda et al., 2003). Furthermore,
cacao contains methylxanthine alkaloid, theobromine, and small amounts of quercetin
derivatives (Cadiz-Gurrea et al., 2014).
In-vivo and in-vitro studies have confirmed
the bioactivities of cacao phenolic compounds (Djouss et al., 2011; Ferrazzano et al.,
2009; Lotito and Frei, 2006).
Ribas-Agusti et al. (2014) evaluated the
effects of adding cacao extracts to sausages on meat quality. However, additional
studies are still needed.
      In this study, we examined the optimal ethanol concentration for extracting cacao
nibs and assessed the effects of addition of cacao nib extracts (CEs) to pork
patties on suppression of lipid oxidation and enhancement of meat quality during
refrigerated storage for 15 days.

      Materials and Methods

        Analysis of antioxidant activity of cacao nibs

          Preparation of CEs and evaluation of extraction yields
          The cacao (Theobroma cacao L.) beans used in this study were
produced in Ecuador and were purchased from TreeToBar (Namyangju-si, Korea).
After roasting raw cacao beans at 180&#xB0;C for 15 min in a roaster
(CNR-101A, Genesis, Ansan, Korea), cacao nibs, i.e., the bits of cacao beans
obtained after the husk is peeled, were ground in an ultrafine grinder
(JP5063-1, MHK, Osaka, Japan). The ground nibs were passed through a mesh
(test sieve no. 35, Chunggye Co., Gyeonggi, Korea) to prepare cacao nib
powder (500 &#x3BC;m). Cacao nib powder (20 g) was added to 200 mL of
distilled water (DW) or 50%, 70%, or 99% ethanol and
extracted in a shaker at 25&#xB0;C for 24 h. The CEs were filtered using
filter papers (Whatman No. 2, GE Healthcare, Little Chalfont, UK) and
evaporated with a rotary evaporator (N-1200A, EYELA, Shanghai, China) at a
temperature of less than 50&#xB0;C. After evaporation, the weight of the
CE was divided by the weight of the original cacao nib powder to calculate
the extraction yield (%). To measure phenolic compounds and
antioxidant activity, CE was dissolved in DW or 50%, 70%, or
99% ethanol (cat no. 64-17-5, ethyl alcohol anhydrous, DaeJung,
Namyangju, Korea).

        Analysis of total phenolic compounds (TPC)
        TPC were measured using the Folin&#x2013;Ciocalteu method with modifications
(Slinkard and Singleton, 1977).
Briefly, 2.4 mL of DW and 0.15 mL of 0.25 N Folin&#x2013;Ciocalteu reagent were
added to 0.15 mL of sample diluent (1 g CE/100 mL DW), vortexed, and reacted for
3 min. Next, 0.3 mL of 1 N Na2CO3 was added, samples were
left to stand in the dark for 2 h, and the absorbance at 725 nm was measured.
Tannic acid was used as a standard substance and expressed as mg tannic acid
equivalent (TAE) per g cacao nib powder.

        Analysis of total flavonoid compounds (TFC)
        Total flavonoid compounds (TFC) were measured using the Davis method (Um and Kim, 2007). Briefly, 10 mL of
90% diethylene glycol and 1 mL of 1 N NaOH were added to 1 mL of sample
diluent, vortexed, and reacted in a water bath (10.10 ESI/SK, Alto Shaam,
Menomonee Falls, WI, USA) at 37&#xB0; for 1 h. Then, the absorbance at 420 nm
was read. Quercetin acids was used as a standard substance, and TFCs were
expressed as mg quercetin acids per g cacao nib powder.

        1,1-Diphenyl-2-picrylhytdrazyl (DPPH) radical scavenging activity
        DPPH radical scavenging activity was evaluated using the method of Brand-Williams et al. (1995), with
modifications. Briefly, 1 mL of sample diluent was added to 4 mL of
4&#xD7;10&#x2212;4 M DPPH solution. The reaction mixture was
left to stand in the dark for 30 min. Then, the absorbance at 517 nm was read,
and the DPPH scavenging activity of the CEs was calculated according to the
following equation:

            100

        2,2'-Azino-bis (3-ethylbenzothiazoline-6-sulfonic acid)
(ABTS+) radical scavenging activities
        ABTS+ radical scavenging activity was measured using the method
described by Cuong et al. (2016), with
modifications. Briefly, 7.0 mM ABTS+ solution in DW and 2.45
mM K2O8S2solution in DW were mixed and left to
stand in the dark for 16 h. This solution was then diluted with ethanol. One
milliliter of sample diluent was added to 9 mL of ABTS+
solution. After mixing, the absorbance at 734 nm was read six times at 1-min
intervals, and the average value was used. The ABTS+
scavenging activity of the CEs was calculated according to the following
equation:

            Scavenging&#xA0;activity&#xA0;(%)&#xA0;=&#xA0;[1
            &#x2009;

        Processing of pork patties with different amounts of CEs (dried 70%
ethanol extracts)
        The mixing ratios of the ingredients are shown in Table 1. The chilled pork loin obtained within 24 h after slaughter
(Hongju Meat Co., Hongseong, Korea). Raw meat and back fat were crushed using a
grinding machine (PA-82, Mainca,Barcelona, Spain) equipped with a 3-mm plate.
All ingredients were mixed using kneader (K5SS, KichenAid Co., Benton Harbor,
MI, USA). The pork patty was manufactured using a conventional patty maker (1 cm
in thickness and 8.5 cm in diameter). The pork patties were baked in a
convection oven at 80&#xB0;C for 30 min. After baking, the pork patties were
stored in a refrigerator at 4&#xB0;C for 15 days.

        pH and color measurements
        The pH of the pork patties was measured using a pH meter (Coring 340, Mettler
Toledo, Schwerzenbach, Switizerland) in a homogenate of 5 g sample and 20 mL of
DW (PT 2500 E; Kinematica AG, Kusnacht, Switzerland).
        The color values were measured directly on the patty surface using a Hunter color
reader (CR-400, Minolta, Osaka, Japan). The results are expressed as CIE
L*, CIE a*, and CIE
b*. A white standard plate with a lightness of +94.65,
redness of &#x2212;0.43, and yellowness of +4.12 was used as the
reference.

        Texture profile analysis
        The texture of the patties was analyzed using a texture analyzer (TA-XT2, Stable
Micro System, Haslemere, UK) equipped with a round probe (75 mm diameter).
Samples (2.5&#xD7;2.5&#xD7;1 cm) were cut from the central portion of each
pork patty. The texture features analyzed included hardness, springiness,
cohesiveness, chewiness, and gumminess. The conditions of texture analysis were
as follows: test speed, 3.0 mm/s; post-test speed, 5.0 mm/s; pre-test speed, 5.0
mm/s; trigger force, 5 g; test distance, 7.0 mm. The texture of pork patties was
analyzed 10 times per replication.

        Analysis of thiobarbituric acid reactive substances (TBARS)
        Thiobarbituric acid reactive substances were determined by distillation. Briefly,
10 g of the heated sample was homogenized for 3 min at 1,000&#xD7;g using a
homogenizer (AM-5, Nihonseiki Kasha, Osaka, Japan). The sample was then mixed
with 2.5 mL of HCl, 3&#x2013;4 boiling stones, 1 mL of defoamer, and 47.5 mL of
DW. The samples were purified in a distiller (MS-E102, MTOPS, Seoul, Korea) for
10 min. Next, 5 mL of the collected distillate and 5 mL of TBA reagent were
mixed and heated in a constant-temperature water bath (JSWB-30T, JSR, Seoul,
Korea) at 100&#xB0;C for 35 min. After cooling for 10 min, the absorbance at
538 nm was read using a spectrophotometer (Libra S22, Biochrom, Nottingham, UK).
The measured value was multiplied by a factor value of 7.8 to represent the
TBARS content.

        Total microbial plate counts
        All instruments and solutions used in microbiological experiments were sterilized
before use. To determine total aerobic bacterial count for patties, 10 g sample
and 90 mL of 0.1% peptone water (Difco, Becton, NJ, USA) were transferred
into a sterile stomacher bag and homogenized (HG300V, MAYO, Milano, Italy) for 3
min. Serial dilutions of the homogenate were prepared with 0.1% peptone
water. Next, 0.1 mL of liquid was spread on plate count agar. The total plate
count was determined after incubation at 37&#xB0;C for 24&#x2013;48 h.
Microbial colonies were counted using a digital colony counter (KT0074A,
S&amp;N, Seoul, Korea) and were expressed as Log CFU/g patty sample.

        Sensory evaluation
        Each sample was evaluated by sensory panelists twice. Twenty panelists were
screened from 25 potential panelists based on a basic taste identification test.
Each sample was scored on a single sheet, using a 9-point descriptive scale
(with 1 being extremely undesirable and 9 being extremely desirable). The pork
patties were evaluated for color, flavor, tenderness, juiciness, and overall
acceptability.

        Statistical analysis
        All experiments were repeated at least three times. The data are expressed as
means&#xB1;SDs. The data were analyzed by one-way analysis of variance and
Duncan's multiple range post-hoc tests using SPSS v. 25.0 (IBM, Armonk, NY,
USA). Differences with p values of less than 0.05 were considered
significant.

      Results and Discussion

        Antioxidant activities of CEs prepared using different ethanol
concentrations

          CE yields
          The extraction yields of CEs prepared using different ethanol concentrations
are shown in Fig. 1. The extraction
yield tended to decrease as the ethanol concentration increased; the lowest
yield was observed for 99% ethanol, and the highest yields were
observed for DW and 50% ethanol (p&lt;0.05). In general,
water-soluble polymeric materials such as starch, fiber, pectin, and
proteins have higher extraction yields when extracted with watery solutions
than when extracted with ethanol. When using a high concentration of
ethanol, glycosides, organic acids, and essential oils are extracted. Thus,
the choice of extraction solvent is determined by the material to be
extracted (Lee et al., 2009).
Therefore, our findings can be explained by the fact that more water-soluble
components, such as sugars, proteins, and alkaloids were extracted from the
cacao nibs when using DW and 50% EtOH. Similarly, Lee et al. (2016) reported that the
extraction yield was higher with 75% and 50% ethanol then when
95% ethanol was used. Furthermore, Kim et al. (2004) reported that extraction yields for cacao bean
husk were higher when a diluted ethanol solvent was used than when a pure
ethanol solvent was used, similar to our findings.

ethanol.
              a&#x2013;c Mean sharing different letters are
significantly different (p&lt;0.05).

          TPC and TFC
          As shown in Fig. 2, TPC and TFC were
significantly different (p&lt;0.05) in the CEs prepared with different
ethanol concentrations. TPC and TFC were the highest in CE prepared with
70% ethanol and the lowest in CE prepared with 99% ethanol
(p&lt;0.05). The CE extraction yield increased with decreasing ethanol
concentration of the solvent (Fig. 1);
however, TPC and TFC yields decreased with decreasing ethanol concentration
of the solvent (except 99% EtOH). Antioxidants present in plants are
mostly polar, and the higher the ethanol concentration, the better the
antioxidant extraction (Lee et al.,
2016). However, the use of pure ethanol did not result in the
highest antioxidant extraction yield because the soluble properties of
phenolic compounds and flavonoid glycosides differ in polar and
water-soluble solvents. Phenolic compounds, such as lignins, are ester-bound
to cell wall components in the plant; thus, there is an insoluble fraction
in the alcohol, whereas glycosides are soluble in alcohol. Flavonoids, on
the other hand, are polar and soluble in alcohols, whereas glycosides are
relatively soluble in water (Woo et al.,
1977). Therefore, to extract antioxidant compounds from plants,
aqueous ethanol mixtures are used rather than pure ethanol (Dai and Mumper, 2010). For efficient
antioxidant extraction, it is important to optimize the extraction
conditions in view of homeostasis of the target compound and the
concentration of the antioxidant (Shah et
al., 2014). In most studies on cacao extracts, aqueous
50%&#x2013;80% polar solvents resulted in the best antioxidant
extraction yields (Kim et al., 1993;
Kim et al., 2004; Wang and Helliwell, 2001). In our
study, TPC and TFC yields were the highest when extracted with 70%
ethanol.

            Fig. 2.

              a&#x2013;d Mean sharing different letters are
significantly different (p&lt;0.05).

          On the other hand, Hu et al. (2016)
reported that the TPC contents of extracts from fat-removed cacao beans
using 70% aqueous methanol at 40&#xB0;C for 2 h ranged from 36.21
to 55.58 mg GAE/g sample depending on the roasting conditions, and the TFC
contents ranged from 15.55 to 38.07 mg catechin/g sample. However, in this
study, 70% ethanol yielded the highest TPC (148.09 mg TAE/g) and TFC
(124.59 mg QEA/g) contents (p&lt;0.05). These results may be related to
the presence of phytochemicals, such as methylxanthine, alkaloid, and
theobromine, in addition to catechins in cacao nibs (Cadiz-Gurrea et al., 2014). Additionally, the efficiency
of extracting phenolic compounds from plants varies depending on sample
preprocessing, sample ratio, solvent type, extraction temperature, and
extraction time (Casazza et al.,
2011).

          DPPH and ABTS+ radical scavenging activities
          The DPPH and ABTS+ radical scavenging activities of the CEs
are shown in Fig. 3. In both DPPH and
ABTS+ radical scavenging assays, ascorbic acid had the
highest antioxidant activity, followed by CEs prepared using 70%
ethanol, 50% ethanol, DW, and 99% ethanol (p&lt;0.05).
This was generally consistent with the TPC and TFC results in our study.
Dudonne et al. (2009) reported
that TPC contents were highly correlated with DPPH and
ABTS+ radical scavenging. This is because phenolic
compounds have aromatic rings with hydroxyl groups and can therefore remove
free radicals by forming phenoxyl radicals (Bors and Michel, 2002). Accordingly, we concluded that
70% ethanol was the most effective for extracting antioxidants from
cacao nibs; thus, we used 70% ethanol as the extraction solvent in
subsequent experiments.

              A&#x2013;E Mean within the same concentration with
different letters are significantly different (p&lt;0.05).

        Physicochemical properties of pork patties containing CEs during refrigerated
storage

          pH and color measurements
          Table 2 shows changes in the pH of
pork patties containing CEs during storage. The pH tended to increase during
storage in all treatment groups (p&lt;0.05), suggesting that the
production of ammonia, amine, and other alkaline substances caused by
bacterial activities and protein deamination during storage alkalized the
pork patties (Nychas et al., 1998).
In line with our findings, multiple studies have demonstrated that the pH of
meat products tends to increase during storage (Emin et al., 2016; Mancini et al., 2015; Rodriguez-Calleja et al., 2005). In
contrast, the pH tended to decrease as the CE content increased during
storage, and treatment with 0.1% ascorbic acid resulted in the lowest
pH in all samples (p&lt;0.05). According to Miller et al. (1980), the pH of meat products is
determined by the ratio of base meat and additives and affects freshness,
moisture retention, meat color, and texture. The pH (5.68) of the CE
solution used in the current study and the acidity of ascorbic acid were
thought to have affected the pork patties.

                The mixing ratios of the ingredients are shown in Table 1.

                A&#x2013;D
                Means within a column with different letters are significantly
different (p&lt;0.05).

                a&#x2013;d
                Means within a row with different letters are significantly
different (p&lt;0.05).

          As shown in Table 2, lightness and
yellowness of the patties significantly decreased, whereas red tended to
increase, with increasing CE content (p&lt;0.05, 0 d). During the
roasting of cacao nibs, melanoidin is formed in amino-carbonyl reactions
(Maillard reactions) (Oliviero et al.,
2009). Melanoidin modifies the color, taste, and flavor of the
cacao nibs, specifically, it increases darkness and red color (Choi et al., 2016). The color values of
CEs are CIE L* 35.61, CIE a* 9.55, and
CIE b* 10.51, indicating that the cacao nib pigments
affect patty color. During storage, lightness and yellowness of all patties
increased, whereas redness decreased (p&lt;0.05). However, the decrease
in redness was suppressed with increasing CE content. In the control,
redness decreased from CIE a* 4.61 (0 d) to CIE
a* 2.26 (15 d), whereas for 0.1% CE treatment,
redness decreased from CIE a* 6.03 (0 d) to CIE
a* 5.61 (15 d). On day 15, the highest redness was
observed for samples treated with 0.075% CE, 0.1% CE, or
0.1% ascorbic acid, whereas the control group had the lowest redness
value. Choe et al. (2011) reported that reductions in redness in stored
meats are related to the production of brown metmyoglobin as a result of
myoglobin oxidation, and numerous studies have reported that ascorbic acid
effectively delays the oxidation-related discoloration in ground pork and
beef through antioxidant activities (Ahn and
Nam, 2004; Banon et al.,
2007; Mitsumoto et al.,
2005). In line with our findings, Schilling et al. (2018) reported that the antioxidant effects of
rosemary and green tea extracts preserved the redness of sausages by
inhibiting the formation of primary and secondary lipid oxidation products,
which facilitate the oxidation of myoglobin. Thus, the abundance of phenolic
compounds in cacao nibs seemed to suppress the discoloration of patties by
blocking lipid oxidation during storage, similar to ascorbic acid.

          Texture profile analysis
          As shown in Table 3, hardness and
chewiness decreased, whereas gumminess increased with increasing CE content
(p&lt;0.05, 0 d). Hardness tended to increase in all experimental groups
during storage; however, compared with the control, the increase in hardness
was not as dramatic in the CE- and 0.1% ascorbic acid-treated groups
(p&lt;0.05). In particular, the hardness score in the control group
increased from 3.21 (0 d) to 4.09 (15 d), whereas that in the 0.1% CE
group increased only slightly from 2.09 (0 d) to 2.17 (15 d). Adding
antioxidants to meat products to protect the fascia from lipid oxidation
preserves the membrane integrity of muscle fibers, thereby preventing loss
of moisture in muscle fibers and textural changes of meat products (Estevez et al., 2006; Mitsumoto et al., 1995). Zhang et al. (2003) reported that sage,
a natural antioxidant spice, delays changes in the hardness of sausages
during refrigerated storage by inhibiting lipid oxidation and protein
oxidation. The changes in hardness, chewiness, and gumminess during
refrigerated storage in sausages containing clove extracts, as reported by
Zhang et al. (2017), were similar
to the changes observed in our study. Therefore, this study confirmed that
CEs can delay texture degradation in pork patties.

          TBARS
          Table 4 shows the TBARS contents of
pork patties during refrigerated (4&#xB0;C) storage. TBARS significantly
increased in all groups during storage (p&lt;0.05), suggesting that fats
in pork patties auto-oxidize, even during refrigerated storage (Wenjiao et al., 2014). In CE-containing
patties, TBARS contents were 0.15&#x2013;0.29 mg MDA/kg meat on day 0, which
was substantially lower than that in the control group (0.54 mg MDA/kg;
p&lt;0.05). The TBARS contents of the control group markedly increased
during storage, from 1.21 mg MDA/kg (3 d) to 1.98 mg MDA/kg (15 d;
p&lt;0.05). However, TBARS decreased with increasing CE contents
(p&lt;0.05). In particular, the ascorbic acid treatment group showed the
lowest TBARS content during storage. Ascorbic acid suppresses lipid
oxidation by H2O2 and hydroxyl radicals and therefore
is used as an additive to prevent lipid oxidation in meat products (Ribeiro et al., 2019; Sarma et al., 1997). Moreover,
0.1% CE suppressed lipid oxidation during storage to a level similar
to that observed for 0.1% ascorbic acid (p&lt;0.05). These
findings suggested that CEs effectively suppress lipid oxidation during
refrigerated storage.

                The mixing ratios of the ingredients are shown in Table 1.

                A&#x2013;D
                Mean within a column with different letters are significantly
different (p&lt;0.05).

                a&#x2013;d
                Mean within a row with different letters are significantly

          Lipids in meats and meat products are easily oxidized, and the resulting
hydroperoxides produce secondary lipid oxidation products, i.e., aldehydes
and ketones, which cause off-flavor, thereby diminishing quality (Cuong and Chin, 2016). Antioxidants can
prevent lipid peroxidation by disrupting the chain reaction through the
elimination of radical formation and breakdown of peroxides or by reducing
the local oxygen concentration (Dorman et
al., 2003). Cacao nibs contain adequate amounts of polyphenolic
compounds, which are natural antioxidants, particularly the monomers
catechin and epicatechin and the dimer procyanidin (Lamuela-Raventos et al., 2005; Martinex et al., 2012). The current study confirmed
that CEs are abundant in phenolic compounds and have high radical-scavenging
activities. Jayawadana et al. (2011)
and Tackahata et al. (2001) reported
that soybean extracts containing procyanidin had high DPPH radical
scavenging activity and delayed MDA production in meat products. Mitsumoto et al. (2005) reported that
catechins extracted from tea effectively suppressed lipid oxidation in beef
patties and chicken patties. Ribas-Agusti et
al. (2014) confirmed that sausages prepared with CEs contained
polyphenolic compounds, such as catechin, procyanidin, and quercetin.
Therefore, these results suggested that the antioxidant activities of
polyphenolic compounds in cacao nibs effectively suppress lipid oxidation in
patties during refrigerated storage.

          Total microbial plate counts
          As shown in Table 4, total microbial
plate counts significantly increased in all groups during storage, and CEs
had no significant effect on the microbial count (p&gt;0.05). On day 0
of storage, the total microbial plate count was moderate, ranging from 3.18
to 3.26 Log CFU/g, and on day 15, the count ranged from 6.08 to 6.22 Log
CFU/g. T. cacao L. has antimicrobial activity against
cariogenic microorganisms, such as Helicobacter pylori
(Lawal et al., 2014),
Streptococcus mutans, and Streptococcus
sanguinis (Ferrazzano et al.,
2009). Several studies have reported the effects of cacao on food
poisoning-related bacteria. For example, Bubonja-Sonje et al. (2011) demonstrated that the minimum
inhibitory concentration of phenolic cacao extracts for Listeria
monocytogenes is 0.4 mg/mL, and Takahashi et al. (1999) reported that cocoa extracts have
antimicrobial activity against enterohemorrhagic Escherichia
coli at a very high concentration of 8%. Therefore, the
CE concentrations used in the current study were not sufficient to exhibit
antimicrobial activity, and adding less than 0.1% CE would not affect
the total microbial counts in pork patties. Moreover, there were no
significant differences in total microbial counts between the ascorbic acid
treatment and control groups during storage (p&lt;0.05). Mancini et al. (2015) and Martinez et al. (2007) reported that
ascorbic acid did not inhibit microbial growth on meat products. These
results were consistent with previous findings that the antioxidant
activities of natural antioxidants and ascorbic acid in meat products were
not sufficient to suppress bacterial growth (Bannon et al., 2007; Sanchez-Escalante et al., 2001; Shivas et al., 1984).

        Sensory evaluation
        Sensory traits for baked pork patties prepared with CEs of different
concentrations are shown in Table 5.
Color preference was the highest for samples prepared using 0.075% CE
(score: 5.60). Samples prepared using 0.1% ascorbic acid had the lowest
flavor score, and flavor scores tended to increase with increasing CE content
(p&lt;0.05). As mentioned above, during the roasting of cacao nibs,
melanoidin is formed, which produces the unique flavor of cacao products (Oliviero et al., 2009), which improved
flavor preference. For this reason, the flavor score of ASC is considered to be
relatively low. There were no significant differences in tenderness, and
juiciness preference was the highest for samples prepared using 0.05% CE
(score: 6.30; p&lt;0.05). In terms of overall acceptability, control samples
and samples prepared using 0.05% and 0.075%CEs had the highest
scores; samples prepared using 0.05% CEs had a slightly, but
insignificantly higher mean value than control samples (p&gt;0.05). In line
with our findings, Ribas-Agusti et al.
(2014) reported that cacao extract enhanced the overall sensory
quality of pork sausages, and Lise et al. (2004) reported that coffee extracts
enhanced the flavor preference in pork patties. Therefore, the characteristic
color and flavor of cacao nibs enhanced the quality characteristics of pork
patties, and adding 0.05% or 0.075% CE improves the sensory traits
of pork patties.

      Conclusions
      We investigated the effects of CEs on suppressing lipid oxidation and enhancing the
quality traits of pork patties. CEs prepared using 70% ethanol had the
highest TPC and TFC contents and the highest DPPH and ABTS+
radical scavenging activities. In experiments using CEs- and ascorbic acid-treated
pork patties, CEs had positive effects on redness discoloration and texture
deterioration of pork patties during storage. Additionally, all CEs treatments
suppressed fat oxidation in pork patties, and 0.1% CEs suppressed fat
oxidation to a level similar to that of 0.1% ascorbic acid. CEs at
concentrations of less than 0.1% did not affect the total microbial counts in
pork patties. In sensory evaluations, flavor score for pork patties differed
according to CEs concentrations, and overall acceptability was the highest in the
Control and 0.05% CE and 0.075% CE-containing samples. Considering the
sensory evaluation results and the changes in quality characteristics throughout the
storage period, 0.05% CE and 0.075% CE improved consumer preference
compared to ascorbic acid, an antioxidant used in commercial meat products.
Therefore, we conclude that 70% ethanol solution is optimal for extracting
flavonoids from cacao nibs, and that 0.05% or 0.075% CEs can be added
to pork patties to produce high-quality products from a commercial point of view. In
addition, CEs can improve physicochemical and sensory quality characteristics of
meat products. Further research is needed to improve the quality characteristics of
various meat products.
