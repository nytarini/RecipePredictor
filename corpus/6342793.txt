        Cereal is a staple food and major nutrition source throughout the world. The cereal bran obtained from milling as by-product contains multiple benefits and health-promoting components such as dietary fiber, minerals, vitamins, polyphenols, and phytosterols. However, these by-products are usually undervalued and used in animal feed. To increase the functional and food value, processing techniques linked to improving nutritional characteristics, sensory properties and reducing the inhibitory factors have been developed. These processing techniques include mechanical, enzymatic and thermal processing. It aims to improve the functional properties, enhance the extractability of beneficial food ingredients, reduce the complex structure of the bran and improve solubility, decrease the content of inhibitory factors and improve the bio-accessibility of micronutrients. This review highlights the various technological interventions and application of appropriate processing techniques to process cereal bran for the isolation of functional food ingredient and thus utilizing the nutritious by-product of cereal processing industry.
