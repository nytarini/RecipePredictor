   In this issue of the journal, Whear and colleagues1 present the results of a systematic review focused on mealtime
interventions in long term care (LTC) and their effect on behavioral and psychological
symptoms of dementia (BPSD) (e.g., fear, agitation). In a companion article2 these authors focus on nutritional outcomes of mealtime
interventions. Key findings from both of these systematic reviews are that: 1) there is the
potential to positively influence nutrition parameters and BPSD by changing the mealtime
environment, 2) quality of these studies is generally poor due to small sample sizes, lack of
randomization, and inadequate control for confounding factors within resident, staff and
organizational levels, and 3) interventions are only briefly articulated, limiting
understanding of how they work and how they can be replicated in typical LTC homes. The
authors recommend that high quality studies be conducted to demonstrate the value of these
interventions for improving nutritional health and quality of life of residents.1,2 We would
add to this recommendation that intervention research needs to be based on a conceptual
framework grounded in current evidence that demonstrates that there are several influences on
the varied activities (e.g., arriving, eating, waiting socializing) that occur during a
mealtime3 and that there are several
intermediate (e.g. BPSD, food intake, strength) and ultimate outcomes (e.g., nutritional
status, comorbidity, quality of life, functional ability, mortality) to consider. Mealtime is
a complex process with multiple levels of influence including residents, staff, home and
government.3 For example, organizational
practices around when the dining room is open for meals can result in rushed mealtimes and if
staffing is short or staff are drawn away from assisting others to encourage an agitated
resident to remain at the table, all meal participants, including staff, are affected. Fully
understanding the problem and its determinants is needed to design interventions that have the
greatest impact.4

Malnutrition occurs in more than half of residents living in LTC
5–10 with consequences of: infections; falls; pressure ulcers; declines in
function and cognition; hospital admissions; extended lengths of stay in hospital; and
death.11–15 Poor food and fluid intake is the primary cause for LTC
malnutrition as average consumption is approximately 50% of food offered; 16 thus LTC malnutrition is both
preventable and treatable.16,17 Research has
demonstrated that interventions can increase food intake and also improve nutritional status
and other health and functional outcomes.18–21 The high prevalence of
malnutrition and its potential consequences, necessitates the development of innovative and
effective interventions that target poor food intake in LTC.

Improving food intake in LTC has been identified as a priority by researchers,
decision makers and users (i.e., LTC homes, residents, families)22,23 yet, this aspect
of care, as evidenced by these authors’ reviews1,2 has been sorely neglected in terms
of intervention research. This is partially due to the challenges of: conducting LTC
research24; measuring ultimate outcomes,
some of which are influenced by factors other than BPSD and food intake; and lack of
understanding of the complexity of improving food intake and mealtimes in LTC. To address this
last gap, a comprehensive understanding of the food and fluid intake of residents in LTC and
determinants of inadequate intake is needed to build the evidence base to support the
development of sustainable, cost-effective and feasible interventions.25

Whear and colleagues1 focused on
mealtime interventions for persons living with dementia that included changes to the
foodservice, physical environment and social interaction. The mealtime experience can be
operationalized as the physical and psychosocial mealtime environment and mealtime processes
that can influence food intake. Mealtime is often the highlight of the day for residents,
providing opportunities for social interaction as well as development of social relationships
with care providers and dining companions.26
Apathy and depression have been found to be independently associated with weight loss in LTC
residents27 and may be linked to the
mealtime experience.28 Two theories
Mealtimes as Active Processes in LTC,3 and the Life Nourishment Theory,29 developed in the context of persons living with dementia,
demonstrate the importance and potential influence of the psychosocial environment on food
intake. It is hypothesized that positive social connections and honoring individual identities
(e.g., food preferences, when a resident wants to eat) at mealtimes will decrease BPSD and
promote food intake and quality of life. For example, family style dining provides greater
opportunity for social interaction and choice of food offerings and has been shown to improve
energy intake.30 The Eden Alternative, which
is a ‘household’ model providing care to fewer residents so that it is more
person-centred and home-like, has also shown some benefit with respect to maintaining body
weight.31 This association may be linked
to greater individualization of care including food preferences. Use of person-centred
strategies such as accommodating individualized needs and preferences during mealtimes has
been qualitatively explored 32,33 but has yet to be quantitatively assessed with respect to
improved outcomes.

As described in the systematic review in this issue1, the physical environment has been the focus of the
majority of mealtime interventions when considering the outcome of BPSD. Physical environments
influence eating34 and
‘homelike’ environments with music, décor, and table dressings have
also been shown to improve residents’ food intake.35,36 Furthermore, food being plated
on the unit, rather than in the kitchen, enhances consumption;37 residents see and smell the food, interact with staff, and
may be able to choose their meal and desired portions at the point of service. On the other
hand, these bulk delivery systems can create noise and distraction.38 This last finding, points to the need to consider the
physical environment more broadly and the divergent effects an intervention may have on the
mealtime experience. As noted by Whear1,
considering positive behaviors such as increased social interaction rather than solely BPSD is
also important when determining impact of these interventions.

The Five Aspects of Meal Model39 is
a conceptual framework for understanding and thus, promoting improved dining experiences,
which was developed for the restaurant and food-retail sectors. In this model, eating
occasions are influenced by the: room (e.g., table set up, lighting); meeting (e.g., social
interaction); food product; and management control system (e.g., training, policies). All of
these collectively result in the dining atmosphere (the 5th aspect). This
framework suggests that there is an intersection of food or meal quality and mealtime
experience. We contend that these two domains (meal quality and mealtime experience), are key
to food intake, BPSD, and other mealtime outcomes and that a third domain of ‘food
access’, which can limit or alter food intake, should also be considered when
designing interventions. This understanding is consistent with Whear’s companion
systematic review2 focused on nutrition
outcomes, which identified eating assistance and foodservice interventions, in addition to
physical and psychosocial mealtime interventions, identified in the BPSD- focused
review.1

In the context of LTC, meal quality can be operationally defined as food and fluid
offerings that are preferred and culturally appropriate, appealing, served at an acceptable
temperature, and that meet the nutritional requirements of residents. Quality food is favored
over oral nutritional supplements by residents and family for meeting nutritional needs and
enhancing quality of life.40 Regional
policies and home-level practices with respect to menu planning, choice of commercial or
in-house food products, food variety, food budget, and the mandated role and time allocated to
clinical dietitians all have the potential to influence the types and quality of food provided
in LTC, yet we know little about the associations among these factors and food intake.

Evidence to date suggests that increased funding for food improves energy intake in
LTC residents.41 A shorter menu cycle length
and tray service (rather than bulk food service delivery) is associated with increased
malnutrition.42 LTC menus have also been
found to be low in protein and micronutrients16 and are likely insufficient to support adequate health and
function.43 Of specific concern are
modified-texture foods (e.g., pureed) that are frequently provided to persons with dysphagia
(i.e., swallowing impairment) to manage their swallowing difficulty. These foods can have poor
sensory appeal and low nutrient density.44–46

In addition to mealtime experience and meal quality, the ability to access the meal
is also important when trying to influence intermediate and ultimate outcomes related to
dining in LTC. This domain is operationalized as those factors that influence food/fluid
access and specifically: the availability of food (e.g., meal timing, between meal snacks);
the ability to taste and smell; dysphagia; dentition and oral health; eating ability; and the
time provided for eating assistance.

Taste and smell are commonly affected in older adults64 and specifically
in those with dementia,47 potentially
impairing food intake and nutritional status. Dysphagia is a significant comorbidity that
influences food intake and malnutrition;48
it has been suggested that up to 70% of LTC residents experience some level of
swallowing difficulty.38,49 Additionally, dental factors such as loose teeth, poorly
fitting dentures, or poor oral health, may contribute to situations in which poorer quality
(i.e., low in nutrients) regular or modified-texture foods are consumed. Oral health status of
LTC populations has been rarely examined; prevalence of untreated cavities is approximated at
50%.50 The pain and distress
associated with poor oral health can consequently affect food intake and
malnutrition.46,48 Furthermore, both dysphagia and poor oral health can also
lead to aspiration pneumonia,51 with
consequent poor intake, malnutrition and hospitalization.

Difficulty accessing food due to packaging, lids, and dishware causes stress at
mealtimes and is associated with poor food intake.38,42 Agitation and decreased
self-feeding capacity also result in decreased consumption.34,52,53 Assistance with food intake ranges from setting up the
meal and opening packages, to encouragement; from partial assistance with some foods, to total
eating assistance for those unable to feed themselves. For those requiring assistance, food
access is influenced by the number of qualified, trained staff, the number of residents
requiring assistance, the type of assistance needed, and the presence of family, volunteer or
paid meal helpers who can provide one-on-one help.54 For instance, a staffing ratio of 3:1 as compared to 5:1 significantly
improves energy intake.41 Requiring
assistance commonly results in inadequate food intake.38,48 It is anticipated that as many
as 50% of LTC residents requiring total assistance could consume at least some of
their food independently with environmental changes and supports for autonomy,55 such as sufficient time to eat.54 All of these access factors have the capacity to
impact the mealtime experience and intermediate and ultimate outcomes.

This brief overview of the domains of mealtime experience,
meal quality and meal access confirm that mealtimes are
complex including factors at resident (e.g., eating ability), staff (e.g., training), LTC home
(e.g., dining room environment), and system (e.g., governmental food budget allocation,
regulations). The majority of intervention studies identified in Whear’s systematic
reviews1,2 were single activities or strategies that did not attempt to target more
than one determinant of BPSD and food intake, nor did they consider the interplay of
multi-level determinants on the success of the intervention. Lack of statistical significance
in many studies conducted to date1,2 may, in part, be due to focusing on a single determinant
(e.g., lack of social interaction) rather than developing and evaluating complex interventions
with multiple active ingredients targeting more than one determinant. Family style dining with
its components of social interaction, food choice, and increased independence is an example of
a complex intervention, and targets factors at the resident- and LTC-levels when physical
environmental changes are also undertaken. Statistically and clinically relevant outcomes have
been shown for this multi-level, complex intervention.30 Innovative, multi-level (e.g., target the resident, staff, home, and/or
system) interventions are needed to address the problem of inadequate food intake and
consequent malnutrition in LTC, as determinants likely interact. We have developed an
evidence-based conceptual framework, Making the Most of Mealtimes (M3) that integrates
multiple domains targeting multiple levels (see figure
1).56 We propose this framework
to guide the development and evaluation of future multi-level, complex interventions focused
on mealtimes.

The question then arises, which determinants within the domains of meal quality,
mealtime experience and meal access have the potential to have the greatest effect on outcomes
when incorporated into a complex intervention. Unfortunately, our understanding of why
inadequate food intake occurs in LTC is fragmented; we have yet to conduct the necessary
comprehensive, large observational studies to demonstrate which determinants when considered
together, have the greatest association with outcomes. Few multi-level determinant studies
have been conducted to date, but this literature demonstrates the importance of considering
factors such as food cost and size of the LTC home25,41,57 as well as resident and staff-level factors. As well, much of our
understanding of the potential effect of diverse determinants is limited as studies focus on
factors that cannot be changed. For example, several studies have associated dementia with
poor food intake,38,48 but we can do little to change the progression of diseases
that cause cognitive impairment. Persons with dementia often require some level of eating
assistance38 and this determinant can be
changed; staff can be trained on supportive assisting techniques,54 and sufficient time and accommodations can be provided for
eating independently (e.g., finger foods). Research guided by a conceptual framework focused
on multi-level determinants that are amenable to change is needed.

Whear et al.1 have reviewed the
state of evidence with respect to mealtime interventions, focusing their search on comparator
studies with an outcome of BPSD. This excellent review provides direction for developing more
rigorous research and provides a basis on which to build interventions. We also recommend
that: 1) research focused on food and mealtimes use a conceptual basis like the Making the
Most of Mealtimes (M3) framework, 2) that comprehensive, sufficiently powered observational
studies be conducted that collectively assess those determinants amenable to intervention, to
identify those that are potentially most import to target in interventions, and 3) that
complex interventions be developed that target multiple determinants, across multiple levels
of influence, which are subsequently evaluated with rigorous research methods.

Poor food and fluid intake is a common but preventable problem in
LTC and is likely associated with mealtime BPSD. Inadequate intake leads to malnutrition, and
with its high prevalence in LTC there is a subsequent significant impact on the quality of
life, health, care, and costs for residents in LTC. The anticipated increase in need for LTC
residences over the next three decades24 as
the baby-boomers age, necessitates solutions to the problem of poor food intake in LTC. Yet,
effective solutions will continue to be elusive until this problem is fully described.
Translational research is required to improve LTC practice.58 Previous research2 has shown that we can improve food intake in LTC and a conceptual basis to
future investigations could result in further benefits. Feasible and cost-effective solutions
that can be implemented across the current system are urgently needed and research agendas
based on practicable mealtime activities that target determinants amenable to change, need to
be the focus of future research.
