e is a Gram (+),
anaerobic, spore forming, rod shaped and cytotoxin producing bacterium, which has an
optimal growth temperature at 35&#xB0;C&#x2013;40&#xB0;C. The organism can
colonize throughout the intestinal tract of humans and various animal species (Pasquale et al., 2012; Pelaez et al., 2013; Troiano et
al., 2015). The possibility of C. difficile presence in
intestinal of healthy individuals and newborns are 2%&#x2013;3% and
40%, respectively (Libby and Bearman,
2009). The most frequent predisposing risk factor for C.
difficile infection (CDI) in humans and animals is the destruction of
regular intestinal microflora due to long-term antibiotic usage. CDI causes
gastrointestinal symptoms such as diarrhea, pseudo-membranous colitis, toxic mega
colon, and even deaths can be seen in some serious cases (De Boer et al., 2011; Drudy et
al., 2007; Rodriguez et al., 2012;
Thitaram et al., 2016).
      Some C. difficile strains produce Toxin A (enterotoxin) and Toxin B
(cytotoxin) or both which were released from tcdA and
tcdB genes, and some others can have cdtA and
cdtB genes which produce binary toxin. The virulence of this
bacterium is mainly related to the presence of these toxins. In terms of increased
toxin production and enhanced sporulation attribute, some C.
difficile hypervirulent ribotypes such as 027 (RT027) and 078 (RT078)
are at the forefront and known as the main cause of human CDI that causes acute and
recurring outbreaks with significant mortality in some critical cases (Jobstl et al., 2010; Rahimi et al., 2015; Romano et
al., 2012; Simango and Mwakurudza,
2008).
      Generally, CDI is accepted as a nosocomial infection, but, the epidemiology of
C. difficile has been changing according to researches
reporting an increase in community-associated CDI that is not related with
traditional risk factors (long-term antibiotic usage, age, hospitalization, etc.)
(Candel-Perez et al., 2019). In this
regard, C. difficile was isolated from different matrices such as
soil, fresh and wastewater, butchery animals and meat products, poultry, sea food,
vegetable and ready to eat food varieties by a number of researchers. All these data
highlight the importance of C. difficile transmission routes other
than the hospital environment. Recently, the studies about the presence of
C. difficile and its human pathogenic ribotypes in animal
originated foods draw attention to butchery animals and therefore meat product
varieties can be one of the possible transmission pathways for humans (Deng et al., 2015; Hampikyan et al., 2018; Metcalf
et al., 2010; Metcalf et al.,
2011; Rodriguez et al., 2013; Weese et al., 2010).
      The objective of this study is to reveal the presence of C.
difficile in meat products, to analyze the ribotype diversity of
isolates including RT027 and RT078 by PCR to designate the toxin production ability
by ELISA and to determine the antibiotic susceptibility of the isolates against some
antibiotics that are mostly used for the treatment of C. difficile
infection.

      Materials and Methods

        Meat product samples
        319 meat products (71 salami, 50 sausage, 52 sucuk, 50 pastrami, 36 uncooked
meatball, 30 smoked meat and 30 cooked d&#xF6;ner) were obtained from
butcheries and supermarkets located in Istanbul, Turkey. 20 sucuk and 16
uncooked meatball samples were collected from 20 different butcheries and 71
salami, 50 sausage, 32 sucuk, 50 pastrami, 20 uncooked meatball and 30 cooked
d&#xF6;ner samples were obtained from 35 different supermarkets. An average of
15 samples were collected from one butchery and two supermarkets per month
during February 2017&#x2013;November 2018 and were immediately taken to the
Laboratories of Istanbul University-Cerrahpasa, Faculty of Veterinary Medicine
Department of Food Hygiene and Technology in an insulated icebox and the
analyses were started within the same day (less than 24 h).

        C. difficile isolation
        The 25 g of each sample was mixed with 225 mL of C. difficile
enrichment broth prepared according to Hampikyan
et al. (2018). The mixture was incubated at 37&#xB0;C for 10 days
under anaerobic conditions by using Anaerogen Kit (SR0173, Oxoid, Basingstoke,
UK), Anaerobic Jar (HP0011A, Oxoid) and Anaerobic indicator (BR 0055B, Oxoid).
After alcohol shocking, the sediment was spread on C. difficile
selective agar (CM0601+CDMN supplement SR 0173+5%
defibrinated horse blood, Oxoid) and then petri dishes were incubated for
48&#x2013;72 hours at 37&#xB0;C under anaerobic conditions.
        Colonies with greyish ground glass appearance with horse manure odor were
evaluated as suspected colonies and further analyses were carried out such as
gram staining and latex agglutination test according to manufacturer's manual.
(C. difficile test kit, DR1107A, Oxoid). Before PCR
analyses, the colonies were purified in tryptic soy agar (CM0131, Oxoid)
including 5.0% defibrinated horse blood and incubated anaerobically at
37&#xB0;C for 48&#x2013;72 hours. Before PCR analyses, the colonies were
purified in tryptic soy agar (CM0131, Oxoid) including 5.0% defibrinated
horse blood and incubated under anaerobic conditions for 48&#x2013;72 hours at
37&#xB0;C.

        DNA preparation
        For amplification process, a loopful of colony, which was cultivated in blood
agar was diluted in 1 mL sterile saline solution (0.85%) and boiled for
10 minutes. Then extracted DNA was stored at &#x2013;20&#xB0;C.

        Confirmation of isolates and determination of toxigenic genes
        C. difficile specific triose phosphate isomerase (tpi) gene and
toxin producing genes tcdA and tcdB were
searched by PCR. For this purpose, the primers and protocols were used according
to Lemee et al. (2004) with minor
modification with simplex PCR on CG Palm-Cycler (CG 1-96 Genetix Biotech,
Australia &amp; Asia). Binary toxin genes (cdtA and
cdtB) were determined by means of multiplex PCR explained
by Stubbs et al. (2000). For
electrophoresis process ethidium bromide, which contains 1.5% agarose
gel, and for gel screening UV transilluminator were used and imaged with the
Dolphin-DOC analysing system (Wealtec, Nevada, NV, USA). ATCC 9689 and BAA 1870
strains were used as positive control for tpi,
tcdA, tcdB, and tpi,
cdtA and cdtB genes respectively.

        PCR-ribotyping
        The 16S-23S intergenic spacer regions of C. difficile isolates
were amplified according to Bidet et al.
(1999) and ABI 310 was used for capillary electrophoresis. Genetic
Analyser, a 36 cm array length, default fragment analysis, POP4 polymer and
LIZ1200 as a size standard (Applied Biosystems, Waltham, MA, USA). WEBRIBO
database was used for ribotype determination after Gene Mapper&#xAE; v4.9
(Applied Biosystems) software processing (Indra
et al., 2008).

        Toxin detection test
        ELISA test kit (Ridascreen Art No: C0801, R-Biopharm AG, Darmstadt, Germany) was
used for the detection of toxin production. A loopfull of colonies cultured on
blood agar and confirmed as C. difficile was diluted in 1 mL
sample dilution buffer and centrifuged at 2,500&#xD7;g for 5 minutes. After
centrifuging step, supernatant was used for the detection of toxin presence
according to the supplier&#x2019;s manual.

        Antibiotic susceptibility test
        The antibiotic susceptibility of C. difficile isolates was
examined by Minimum Inhibitor Concentration (MIC) Evaluator strips (Oxoid)
according to the supplier&#x2019;s manual. According to this, the colonies were
passaged to tryptic soy agar (CM0131, Oxoid) with 5% defibrinated horse
blood and incubated for 12 hours under anaerobic conditions. The colonies
confirmed by PCR were spread on Brucella Agar (CM0169, Oxoid) containing 5
&#x3BC;g/mL Hemin, 1 &#x3BC;g/mL vitamin K1 and sheep blood
(5.0%) and two MIC Evaluator strips were placed on agar. The breakpoint
values of tested antibiotics were gained from Clinical and Laboratory Standards
Institute (CLSI, 2018) and from The
European Committee on Antimicrobial Susceptibility Testing (EUCAST, 2019).

      Results and Discussion
      The present study investigated the presence of C. difficile in
various meat products in Turkey. A total of 319 different meat products were
analyzed for the presence of tpi gene which is specific for
C. difficile by PCR and the organism isolated in 17
(23.9%) salami, 3 (5.8%) sucuk, 1 (2.8%) uncooked meatball and
1 (2.0%) sausage samples. On the other hand, the organism could not be
detected in pastrami, smoked meat and cooked d&#xF6;ner samples (Table 1).

      Also, a number of studies from many countries were conducted for the determination of
C. difficile from various meat products. In a research, Esfandiari et al. (2014) detected C.
difficile in 4 out of 56 (7.1%) beef hamburger samples. In
another study conducted in Texas USA by Harvey et
al. (2011), the organism was isolated from pork chorizo in a rate of
9.5% (23/243). In 2007, Songer et al.
(2009) declared that 17 out of 46 (37.0%) different meat products
obtained from grocery stores in Arizona, USA were contaminated with C.
difficile. In a study performed by Rodriguez et al. (2014) in Belgium, C. difficile was
found in 5 out of 107 (4.7%) pork sausage and 3 out of 133 (2.3%) beef
burger samples. Our results were found to be similar to those of Esfandiari et al. (2014), whereas lower than
Harvey et al. (2011) and Songer et al. (2009), but higher than Rodriguez et al. (2014). In our country, in a
similar study conducted on a limited number of beef meat products by Ersoz and Cosansu (2018), C.
difficile was detected in one of each 18 uncooked meatball and 12
cooked meat doner samples (in a rate of 5.5% and 8.3%, respectively)
whereas, the bacterium could not be isolated in four salami, one frankfurter and one
bacon samples. Contrary to this, in France Bouttier
et al. (2010) reported that they could not detect any C.
difficile strain from 59 pork sausage samples. Similar result was found
by Pires et al. (2018) who could not
determine the bacterium from 80 meat products (beef, pork, hamburger).
      The presence of C. difficile in various animal carcasses has been
reported by a number of researchers due to some important factors such as,
unhygienic slaughterhouse conditions, removing the animal remains and extraneous
matter improperly, contamination of carcasses with faeces, improper chilling
processes, unhygienic storage conditions, lack of personnel and equipment hygiene
(Hampikyan et al., 2018; Harvey et al., 2011; Rodriguez et al., 2013; Songer
et al., 2009; Susick et al.,
2012). In the light of these data, it can be understood that the meat used in
manufacturing of meat products may be contaminated with C.
difficile during the slaughtering and post-slaughtering processes. In
addition to this, lack of microbiological quality of ingredients and
personnel-equipment hygiene along the meat products production line, unhygienic
production processes, insufficient heat and time treatments for those heat processed
meat products have an important role in C. difficile contamination
for these foods.
      According to our results, high prevalence of C. difficile in salami
samples are quite remarkable. This situation can be explained by as follows; because
salami is thicker, voluminous and more sizable than the other examined samples, it
constitutes better suitable and anaerobic conditions for the bacteria. The heat
treatments used in salami production can be applied in a shorter time and lower
temperature than required accidentally or intentionally (due to economic reasons),
and as a result, the inhibition effect of temperature on bacteria remains
insufficient. Moreover, having higher water content and pH levels compared to other
analyzed samples are some other factors that can help the bacteria survive in
salami.
      According to PCR ribotyping, 9/22 (40.9%) strains were characterized as RT027,
while RT078 could not be isolated in any examined meat product samples. However,
four out of 22 isolates were identified as most likely (ML) RT027, two of them
ML-R241 and one ML-R686 whereas, seven of them were defined as new ribotype
according to WEBRIBO database (Table 2).
Lately, the isolated C. difficile strains from various meat and
meat products show similarities with some certain strains such as RT027 and RT078
responsible for CDI outbreaks in humans. In this context, Curry et al. (2012) examined 102 pork sausage and found RT078 in
2 (1.96%) samples. In another study, Rodriguez et al. (2014) detected C. difficile in 3 out
of 133 (2.3%) burger beef samples and one isolate was RT078. In a similar
study, Songer et al. (2009) reported that
C. difficile was found in 1 out of 7 (RT027) summer sausage, 10
out of 16 (two isolates RT027 and seven RT078) braunschweiger, 3 out of 10 (one
isolate RT027 and two RT078) chorizo and 3 out of 13 (one isolate RT027 and two
RT078) pork sausage samples. In contrary to this, in our study RT078 could not be
detected in any analyzed samples, however our results for RT027 were correlated well
with above-mentioned findings.

      In various studies, C. difficile and its hypervirulent ribotypes
were found in some meat products with the different rates of prevalence. The reason
of this difference can be explained by the efficiency of good hygiene practices in
establishments, different heat-time treatment in production process, animal
characteristics (age, breed, etc.), geographical and seasonal differences, sampling
amount and the isolation methods.
      In terms of antibiotic susceptibility, MIC values of C. difficile
strains isolated from meat products were shown in Table 3. All isolates were susceptive to amoxicillin-clavulanic acid,
tetracycline and vancomycin and 21 (95.4%) to metronidazole. On the other
hand, imipenem and cefotaxim resistance was observed in all detected isolates (Table 4). Concerns about the use of antibiotics
for to promote growth, to treat sick animals and to prevent diseases in animal
husbandry have gradually increased in recent years. Some certain antibiotics such as
vancomycin, amoxicillin-clavulanic acid, metronidazole are used to treat various
infections in butchery animals and CDI/CDI related diarrhea in humans. Some
important factors such as host susceptibility, patient age and the unconscious
antibiotic usage in food animals has deduced the significance of C.
difficile, which is responsible for 15%&#x2013;30% of
cases of antibiotic associated diarrhea around the world (Hampikyan et al., 2018; Thitaram et al., 2016).

      Within this scope, the researches demonstrate that most of the isolated C.
difficile strains from various foods are resistant to imipenem and
cefotaxim whereas, susceptible to amoxicillin, ampicillin, tetracycline,
metronidazole and vancomycin (Hampikyan et al.,
2018; Jobstl et al., 2010; Rahimi et al., 2015; Simango and Mwakurudza 2008; Thitaram et al., 2016; Troiano et al.,
2015; Varshney et al., 2014). As
it is shown in Table 4, our results are
similar to above-mentioned findings. The results of our study demonstrate that all
isolates recovered from different meat products were susceptible to amoxicillin,
tetracycline, vancomycin, ampicilline and clindamycin in a rate of 100.0%,
except metronidazole (94.1%). On the other hand, all isolates have shown
resistance to cefotaxim and imipenem. Interestingly, Ersoz and Cosansu (2018) reported that two isolates recovered from
uncooked meatball and cooked meat d&#xF6;ner showed resistance to
tetracycline-vancomycin and metronidazole-vancomycin, respectively. These different
results situated in the various literatures can be explained by the genetic
characteristic of isolated C. difficile strains or the exposure of
food animals to antibiotics during farm rearing.
      The toxin genes (tcdA, tcdB, and
cdtA/B) of C. difficile strains were
determined by PCR. tcdA, tcdB, and
cdtA/B genes were detected in 22 (100%), 22
(100%) and 19 (86.4%) out of 22 different meat products, respectively.
The evaluation of the toxin genes of isolates and the number of ribotypes detected
from various meat product samples were shown in Table 2. Three (100%) sucuk, 1 (100%) sausage, 1
(100%) meatball and 14 salami sample isolates have all three toxin genes
whereas, 3 salami samples did not enclose any cdtA/B genes. ELISA
was used for the detection of C. difficile Toxin A and B. As it can
be seen from Table 2 all detected isolates
had the toxin producing ability. Toxin production by tcdA,
tcdB, cdtA and cdtB genes is
one of the main virulence factor of C. difficile. In our study, all
detected isolates from different meat product samples were toxigenic (Table 2). Likely, in a research performed by
Songer et al. (2009), it was reported
that all isolated (37 out of 88) C. difficile strains from various
meat products (summer sausage, braunschweiger, chorizo, and pork sausage) were
toxigenic. In similar studies about the presence of C. difficile in
hamburgers, two and three isolates were detected by Von Abercron et al. (2009) and Rodriguez
et al. (2014), respectively and all isolates were found to be toxigenic.
These findings show parallelism to our results.

      Conclusion
      In conclusion, the results of this comprehensive study conducted in Turkey reveals
the presence of C. difficile in different meat products. The main
cause of this presence can be explained by the contamination of carcasses during
slaughterhouse, transport, cold storage processes, also contamination of the
products during meat production processes in facilities or in retail markets during
selling and presenting. Although, there is no certain proof indicating that
C. difficile is a food-borne pathogen, it should be considered
that the presence of this bacterium in meat and meat products may be a potential
risk for consumers. Therefore, these products can be evaluated as a potential
contamination source of C. difficile from animals to humans
