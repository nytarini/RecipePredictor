To evaluate the relative validity and reliability of the SEARCH food frequency questionnaire (FFQ) that was modified from the Block Kids Questionnaire.

Design
Study participants completed the 85-item FFQ twice plus three 24-hour dietary recalls within one month. We estimated correlations between frequencies obtained from participants with true usual intake for food groups and nutrients, using a two-part model for episodically-consumed foods and measurement error adjustment.

Setting
The multi-center SEARCH for Diabetes in Youth Nutrition Ancillary Study.

Subjects
A subgroup of 172 participants aged 10 - 24 years with type 1 diabetes.

Results
The mean correlations adjusted for measurement error of food groups and nutrients between FFQ and true usual intake were 0.41 and 0.38, respectively, with 57% of the food groups and 70% of the nutrients exhibiting correlations &gt;0.35. Correlations were high for low-fat dairy (0.80), sugar-sweetened beverages (0.54), cholesterol (0.59) and saturated fat (0.51), while correlations were poor for high fiber bread and cereal (0.16) and folate (0.11). Reliability of FFQ intake based on two FFQ administrations was also reasonable with 54% of Pearson correlation coefficients ≥ 0.5. Reliability was high for low fat dairy (0.7), vegetables (0.6), carbohydrates, fiber, folate and vitamin C (all 0.5), but less than desirable for low fat poultry and high fiber bread, cereal, rice and pasta (0.2-0.3).

Conclusions
While there is some room for improvement, our findings suggest that the SEARCH FFQ performs quite well for the assessment of many nutrients and food groups in a sample of youth with type 1 diabetes.

   Introduction
Type 1 diabetes is one of the leading chronic conditions in youth.1 The incidence of type 1 diabetes is increasing worldwide at roughly 2-3% per year which has recently been confirmed among non-Hispanic white youth in the United States (US) by the SEARCH for Diabetes in Youth Study.1-4 Even though medical nutritional therapy is one of the four cornerstones of care for youth with type 1 diabetes,5 this group falls markedly short of reaching the current dietary recommendations.6 Thus, while obesity has traditionally not been a part of the classical type 1 diabetes presentation, today, obesity in youth type 1 diabetes is as common if not more common than in youth without diabetes.7

Over the past decades, nutritional epidemiology has increasingly focused on foods, food groups and dietary patterns, in addition to consideration of nutrients. While the earlier validation literature for FFQs largely focused on nutrients and energy intake,8-10 more recent validation efforts have included foods and food groups.11 Furthermore, while measurement error correction methods for dietary data have a longstanding tradition,12-15 consideration of these methods in validations of FFQs has become more prominent.16-21 Furthermore, statistical methodology has been developed to the point of addressing the underlying complexities in appropriately analyzing the validity of food and food group data.21-23 Researchers at the National Cancer Institute (NCI) and elsewhere have developed a measurement error model for episodically-consumed dietary components that also accommodates daily-consumed dietary components termed the NCI method.2223 This method fits a two-part measurement error model to appropriately model episodically consumed foods, and models the correlations between the probability of consuming a dietary component on a given day and the consumption day amount. An extension of this method models energy as a “third part” of the model to provide energy-adjusted estimates.2124

Motivated by the need to investigate the role of dietary intake on the development of acute and long-term complications of diabetes in youth,4 the SEARCH Nutrition Ancillary Study (SNAS) was designed to take advantage of recent developments in dietary assessment and measurement error adjustment methodology by incorporating a diet assessment sub-study. At the inception of the SEARCH for Diabetes in Youth Study (SEARCH) in 2000, few validated food frequency questionnaires (FFQs) existed for studies of youth, with the Block Kids Questionnaire and the Youth/Adolescent Questionnaire being notable exceptions.1625 The SEARCH study developed a FFQ based on the Block Kids Questionnaire,6 but made a number of substantive changes, including an expanded list of foods to reflect the ethnic, cultural and regional diversity of the SEARCH population and a portion size visual which is why we refer to it as the SEARCH FFQ. Neither the original Block Kids Questionnaire nor the SEARCH FFQ has been evaluated in youth with diabetes. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the relative validity and reliability of the SEARCH FFQ to assess food groups and nutrients in a sub-population of youth with type 1 diabetes aged 10 and older enrolled in SNAS between 2008 and 2011, using the NCI method.

Methods
Study Design and Sample
SEARCH is a multi-center study that began conducting population-based ascertainment of non-gestational cases of diagnosed diabetes in youth less than 20 years of age in 2001 and 2009 for prevalent cases and continues with ascertainment of incident cases from 2002 through the present.4 Details of the methods have been published. The protocol was compliant with the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act and approved by the local institutional review boards. Youth with diabetes identified by the SEARCH surveillance effort completed a brief survey. Those whose diabetes was not secondary to other health conditions were invited to the study visit involving questionnaires, physical examinations and laboratory measurements. Ascertainment was conducted using a network of health care providers including pediatric endocrinologists, hospitals, and other providers. Case reports were validated through physician reports, medical record reviews, or in a few instances, self-report of a physician's diagnosis of diabetes. Diabetes type, as assigned by the health care provider, was categorized as type 1, type 2, and other type (including hybrid type, maturity onset of diabetes in youth, type designated as “other”, type unknown by the reporting source, and missing).

The SEARCH Nutrition Ancillary Study (SNAS) was designed to examine the associations of nutritional factors with the progression of insulin secretion defects and the presence of CVD risk factors in youth with type 1 diabetes. The SNAS protocol was reviewed and approved by the institutional review boards of all participating institutions. The SNAS study did not recruit additional participants, but collected data on infant feeding and nutrient biomarkers from youth enrolled in SEARCH. The SNAS Diet Assessment Sub-study (DAS) was designed to validate the FFQ and correct for measurement error in analyses of dietary intake – disease outcome relationships in the larger SEARCH or SNAS samples. DAS enrolled 172 SEARCH participants aged 10-24 years proportionately from the six SEARCH sites to complete two FFQs one month apart and three 24-hour dietary recalls by phone in the interim.

Dietary Assessment
The FFQ used by the SEARCH study (available upon request) was modified from the Block Kids Questionnaire with an expanded list of foods selected to consider ethnic, cultural, and regional diversity.6 The FFQ was generally completed by the youth without assistance after receiving staff instruction. It consisted of 85 food lines for which the participant indicates if the item(s) was/were consumed in the past week (“yes/no”) and if yes, how many days, and the average portion size. Portion size was queried either as a number (e.g. number of slices of bread) or as very small, small, medium, large relative to pictures of food in bowls or plates provided with the form. An open-ended question at the end of the FFQ queried other foods that a participant might want to report. The nutrient and portion size databases for this instrument were modified from the respective Diabetes Prevention Program databases, using Nutrition Data System for Research (NDSR, Nutrition Coordinating Center, University of Minnesota, Minneapolis MN, Database version 2.6/8A/23) and industry sources.

The previous day 24-hour recalls were conducted by trained and certified staff of the University of North Carolina Nutrition Obesity Research Center – Diet, Physical Activity and Body Composition Core. The interviews were conducted by telephone on randomly-selected, non-consecutive days including two weekdays and one weekend day during a four-week sampling window. NDSR Version 2008 and 2009 software licensed from the Nutrition Coordinating Center (NCC) at the University of Minnesota was employed, using the multi-pass approach in which a participant was first asked to provide a general listing of foods consumed on the previous day, starting with the first food consumed after awakening and ending with the last food consumed before sleep, and grouped by eating episode. Subsequently, the interviewing dietitian reviewed the list with the participant and prompted for foods or eating episodes forgotten or omitted, queried for more detail on the time, name and location of the eating episodes, collected details on the foods reported including quantity and portion size, verified the information and prompted for any omissions.

The 166 individual foods that were ascertained from the 24-hour recalls with the NDSR system were grouped into 27 specific food groups. A total of 27 corresponding food groups were created from the 85 lines of the FFQ by either collapsing food lines based on their major components, or by disaggregating composite foods into constituent foods with the goal of having as similar a composition of the food groups in the FFQ and the 24-hour recall. To be able to compare our findings to other published studies, we also created a number of broad food groups such as all fruit, all vegetables. If the portion size units differed between the 24-hour recall and the FFQ, appropriate conversions were made to the FFQ data.

Statistical Analyses
The most commonly used approach in the past to assessing FFQ validity was to examine the Pearson's correlation between the FFQ and the reference method, i.e. the 24-hour recalls, which is presented here for the sake of comparability. This approach does not account for measurement error and assumes that the variables obtained from the FFQ and 24-hour recalls are continuous, an assumption that is violated for infrequently consumed foods. In fact, many of the studied food groups are consumed infrequently, so that there is a mass of zeroes in the distribution of the 24-hour recall data.

To appropriately account measurement error and this semi-continuous data, we follow Midthune et al.,21 who use the NCI method to estimate the correlation between FFQ intake (Qi) and true usual intake (Ti) for an individual i, briefly described below. The SAS macro and more details can be found at http://appliedresearch.cancer.gov/diet/usualintakes/macros.html. We let pi be the true probability to consume on a given day, Ai to be the true average amount consumed on a consumption day, and Ti = pi × Ai be the true usual intake of the episodically consumed food. The daily intake for day j from the reference instrument, the 24-hour recall, is designated Rij. For this method, we assume that the reported 24-hour recall intakes are assumed to be unbiased estimates of true average daily intake.21 In particular, we assume that any food reported on the 24-hour recall was actually consumed, that any food that was consumed was reported on the 24-hour recall, and that the usual intake from the 24-hour recall on a consumption day is equal to the Ai plus random error (primarily due to day–to-day variation); therefore the mean of the Rij equals Ti. The NCI method models jointly the probability of intake on a given day and, for days on which consumption occurs, the intake amount using the two-part model:

 
          logit(pi)=β10+β11Qi+u1i(Rij∗|Rij&gt;0)=β20+β21Qi∗+u2i+ɛ2ij
         where u1i and u2i are person-specific random effects that have a bivariate normal distribution that are independent of the within-person random error, ε2ij. The asterisks indicate that Rij and Qi are evaluated on a Box-Cox transformed scale.

Then, the true mean daily consumption (Ti) is predicted for each participant as a function of Qi, u1i, and u2i, using the Monte Carlo method to generate the distribution of Ti and Qi. For detecting diet-disease relationships, the key statistics estimated are the correlation coefficient between Ti and Qi and the attenuation factor, which is the slope in the regression of Ti on Qi. Though the NCI method was designed for episodically consumed foods, it can be applied to nutrients and daily-consumed foods by constraining the consumption probability to be equal to 1. This constraint was applied to all nutrients/foods where consumption was reported on greater than 90% of days.

We estimated the correlation coefficients and attenuation factors twice, without adjustment for energy and with energy adjustment, as described in Midthune et al.21 Briefly, energy adjustment involves using the NCI method to jointly model usual intake of the food group or nutrient and usual intake of energy, then using the Monte Carlo method to generate Ti and Qi for pseudo-individuals. From the Monte Carlo estimated distributions, energy-adjusted usual intake and energy adjusted FFQ-intake were estimated using the residual method. The residuals were then used to compute the correlation coefficients and attenuation factors. For nutrient densities the ratio of usual intakes to energy intake was used.24 Standard errors of the correlation and attenuation coefficients were computed as the standard deviations across 100 Monte Carlo samples of usual intake. The attenuation factor was estimated from the measurement error model (with and without adjustment for energy) and quantifies the amount of bias (attenuation) that would apply to the regression coefficient of a specific food group/nutrient – disease relationship. It is a multiplicative factor; thus, the smaller the factor the greater the attenuation of the relative risk estimate. Foods for which consumption was reported on fewer than 90% of the 24-hour recalls were defined as episodically consumed and modeled accordingly.

Test-retest reliability of this FFQ was assessed in the 148 participants who completed both FFQs as part of the SNAS diet assessment sub-study. Reliability coefficients were estimated using intraclass correlation after Box-Cox transforming FFQ reported intakes to improve normality. All analyses were done using SAS version 9.2 (SAS Institute, Cary, NC, USA).

Results
Of the 172 participants that enrolled in the DAS, 15 were excluded because they were missing one or more 24-hour recalls (N=15; 7 had only one 24-hour recall and 8 had two). The analysis sample included 157 participants who completed the first FFQ and all three 24-hour recalls and could be used to assess the validity of the FFQ. The included participants were similar to those excluded in terms of race, age, and gender. Of the analysis sample, 51% were male, 74% were Non-Hispanic White, 15% African American and 11% of other minority race/ethnic group. The mean age was 16 years (range: 10 - 24 years), and the average duration of diabetes was 5.8 years (range: 0.5 - 7.8 years).

Presented in Table 1 are the mean intakes for the food groups for participants reporting any consumption level, as assessed by both the FFQ and the three 24-hour recalls. Intakes were generally higher on the 24-hour recalls than on the FFQ with the exception of meat, nuts and seeds, and fats and oils. Additionally, the percent of the sample reporting any consumption is shown. Mean energy and nutrient intakes for the sample are shown in Table 2 according to dietary assessment instrument. Intake estimates from 24-hour recalls were mostly, but not always, higher than from the FFQ.

Estimates of the correlation between the true usual intake and FFQ-reported intakes and the corresponding attenuation factors are show in Table 3, first as on crude Pearsons' correlations (for comparison to the literature), then as measurement error adjusted coefficients with and without energy adjustment. Use of the measurement error model resulted in a strengthening of correlations. Without consideration of energy intake, the measurement error adjusted correlation for the food groups ranged from high (ρ = 0.80 for low fat dairy) to very low (chips, high fat crackers and popcorn; low fat poultry; high-fiber bread, cereal, rice and pasta all ρ &lt; 0.2) with 16 of 28 food groups (57%) exhibiting correlations ρ &gt; 0.35. Validity estimates were quite high for several food groups typically recommended for youth with type 1 diabetes, such as low fat dairy (ρ = 0.80), vegetables (ρ = 0.48) and foods typically to be avoided, such as soda (ρ = 0.54) or sweets and deserts (ρ = 0.51). Additional adjustment for total energy within the measurement error model did not have a strong impact on the correlation coefficients for most food groups, the exception being fats and oils, meat, and high fat dairy. This may be because misreporting in these food groups may not be proportional to energy intake. The mean measurement error adjusted correlation coefficient was ρ = 0.41 for all food groups without consideration of energy intake and ρ = 0.39 after consideration of total energy.

The correlations for the nutrients ranged from 0.59 for cholesterol to 0.11 for dietary folate, with 14 of 20 nutrients (70%) exhibiting correlation coefficients ρ &gt; 0.35 in the measurement error adjusted but not energy-adjusted model. For example, validity statistics for energy (ρ = 0.42), protein (ρ = 0.38), total fat (ρ = 0.48) and saturated fat (ρ = 0.51) were quite good. A total of 11 of 19 nutrients (58%) exhibited energy-adjusted correlation coefficients ρ &gt; 0.35. In summary, the mean measurement error adjusted correlation coefficient was ρ = 0.38 for all nutrients and ρ = 0.37 adjusted additionally for energy intake. Adjustment for total energy impacted most nutrients. Additional subgroup analyses (data not shown) revealed that correlation coefficients were slighted higher for youth aged 15 years and older (mean measurement error and energy adjusted correlation for foods ρ = 0.47 and ρ = 0.37 for nutrients) compared to those under age 15 years (ρ = 0.44 and ρ = 0.35, respectively).

Shown also in Table 3 are the attenuation factors for each food group and nutrient. The average of the attenuation factors (non energy adjusted) was λ = 0.29 for food groups (λ = 0.25 adjusted for energy) and λ = 0.27 for nutrients (λ = 0.31 adjusted for energy). Energy-adjusted attenuation factors ranged from λ = 0.53 for low fat dairy to λ = -0.03 for chips, high fat crackers, popcorn. The negative attenuation and correlation for chips, high fat crackers, and popcorn indicate a weak relationship between the FFQ and true usual intake. For nutrients, attenuation factors ranged from λ = 0.64 for cholesterol to λ = 0.13 for vitamin C.

Reliability statistics for the FFQ are shown in Table 4. Average intake in the entire sample (including both consumers and non-consumers) was slightly higher for most food groups and nutrients at the first compared to the second administration of the FFQ. Intraclass correlation coefficients ranged from 0.24 for high fiber bread, cereal, rice and pasta, to 0.64 for all dairy and 0.71 for low fat dairy.

Discussion
The literature on validity and reliability of dietary assessment methods in youth was reviewed by McPherson et al. in 2000.26 In addition to the SEARCH FFQ, there are still only a very limited number of validated FFQ instruments for youth designed to be self-administered (or interviewer-administered) that assess a general diet.16182027-37 Comparing to those studies which, like ours, utilized youth's self-report reveals that the SEARCH FFQ performed quite well in terms of validity, focusing on the crude Pearson's correlation coefficients for the sake of comparability1618202937 (Pearson's renergy= 0.35 compared to range of 0.21-0.43 in previous studies; rprotein= 0.31 compared to range of 0.15-0.31); rtotal fat= 0.39 compared to range of 0.15-0.48). Our study also included an assessment of the instrument's reliability, as the FFQ was administered twice about one month apart. The SEARCH FFQ compared favorably to previous studies16203738 (renergy= 0.50 compared to range of 0.30-0.49 in previous studies; rprotein= 0.40 compared to range of 0.26-0.50; rtotal fat= 0.40 compared to range 0.41-0.49).

To the best of our knowledge, only one other evaluation of the relative validity of the Block Kids Questionnaire (completed by the youths themselves) has been published.18 Other reports on this instrument have either relied on the parental report,39 compared only mean intakes,40 or have been solely presented at conferences.25 In a sample of 83 10-17 year old youth (31 of whom had type 2 diabetes) Cullen et al.18 reported energy-adjusted and measurement error adjusted correlation coefficients, ranging from 0.29 for fiber to 0.69 for percent energy from carbohydrates and from -0.03 for grains to 0.74 for dairy. Comparison of the correlation coefficients for the SEARCH FFQ with those published by Cullen et al.18 reveals that with respect to nutrients, our study found a similar range of correlations (0.19 for calcium to 0.70 for cholesterol), with a better relative validity for fiber (0.45 in our study vs. 0.29 in Cullen et al.) and cholesterol (0.70 vs. 0.58), but lower correlations for percent energy from carbohydrates (0.48 vs. 0.69) and percent energy from protein (0.42 vs. 0.55). Furthermore, for the three food groups that were directly comparable between the two studies, the correlation coefficients for vegetables on the SEARCH FFQ were better than in Cullen et al. (0.56 vs. 0.17) and dairy was similarly high (0.63 vs. 0.74). Our correlation for bread, cereal, rice, and pasta was also somewhat higher than in Cullen et al. (0.26 vs. -0.03). While Cullen et al. concluded that in their sample, the Block Kids Questionnaire had “validity for some nutrients, but not (for) most food groups”,18 we reached a different conclusion for the SEARCH FFQ. While there is clearly need for improvement for a few select food groups (i.e. the bread, cereal, rice, and pasta group, especially the high fiber version of these foods; chips, high fat crackers, popcorn; low fat poultry; high fat dairy), it is reassuring that many of the food groups encouraged by dietary guidelines demonstrated good relative validity. These included all fruits and vegetables, vegetables specifically, low fat dairy and dairy in aggregate, and poultry in aggregate. Sugar sweetened beverages, a food group specifically discouraged in dietary guidelines, was also measured with reasonable validity.

Aside from the fact that Cullen et al.18 evaluated the original Block Kids Questionnaire while our study evaluated the SEARCH FFQ, there are several methodological differences between the studies. Unlike our study, Cullen et al.18 relied on two days of 24-hour dietary recalls, and did not accommodate the episodic nature of the consumption of individual food groups. Furthermore, Cullen et al.18 relied on using an estimate of within-subject variability in consumption to perform measurement error adjustment of the correlation between food recalls and FFQ, and did not model systematic bias. This estimate of within-subject variability is best when the food recall data is approximately normally distributed, which is not the case with episodically consumed foods. Furthermore, with three days of 24-hour recall, a participant is more likely to have at least 2 consumption days, which are needed on a subset of participants to partition within-person random error from the variability of usual intake.

While statistical methods to adjust dietary intake for measurement error have long been used in nutritional epidemiology,12-15 the integration into analyses of the validity of dietary assessment instruments is still evolving. Unlike the Spearman or Pearson correlation coefficients that have been used traditionally to evaluate validity, either with or without correction for measurement error,164142 the model-estimated correlation coefficient adjusts for within-person variability in intake in the 24-hour recalls. The NCI method used in this study appropriately models episodically-consumed foods, adjusts for measurement error, transforms amount data to approximate normality, and models the ratio of usual intake of nutrients to energy by jointly modeling dietary components and energy. This method has been applied to food group validation in recent studies of adults.21 Validation efforts in samples of children and youth have either not included any consideration of measurement error41-4537 or applied a more simplified approach for daily-consumed dietary components with consideration only of random error.15161920

In addition to the model-based correlation coefficients, we estimated attenuation factors, which express the amount of bias in an exposure – disease relationship. The smaller the attenuation factor (i.e. the closer to zero), the more biased the exposure – disease relationship. Midthune et al.21 suggest that for food groups (and nutrients) with attenuation factors of 0.2 and greater, measurement error modeling can be a viable solution. However, for attenuation factors &lt;0.2, caution is advised because de-attenuation may result in unreliable estimates. Our results indicate that for some nutrients and food groups there is the potential for a considerable amount of bias. For instance, without consideration of measurement error modeling, the coefficient describing the relationship of FFQ-based dairy intake to disease or risk factor outcomes would be reduced by 43%.

Our study has a number of limitations. Unlike most FFQs used for adults which query the past year,846 the SEARCH FFQ asks about dietary intake in the preceding week, because most youth will not be able to cognitively integrate dietary intake over a whole year. Compared to studies of adults, 2146 validation efforts in youth – including our study – found somewhat weaker correlations, which is likely due to both to this reduced time frame and to younger respondents having more difficulties with the recall.26 When we explored the role of age, like others we too found that relative validity was slightly higher in the older age group of the youth.1837 Because of the more limited list of items compared to an adult FFQ and the shorter time window in which usual intake was assessed, administering the SEARCH FFQ yielded a higher proportion of non-consumption of certain food groups, which in turn limited the ability to create and evaluate very finely classified food groups. In addition, we were unable to adjust for true non-consumers in this study, which requires a large sample size of at least 4 24-hour recalls; however, the true predicted intakes for non-consumers were close to zero. Similar to other studies, we relied on 24 hour dietary recalls as the reference instrument under the assumption that they provide an unbiased estimate of true intake, even though it has been shown that the 24 hour recall is somewhat biased for protein, energy, and protein density in adults.4748 To the extent that the assumption of unbiasedness is violated, this may lead to some overestimation of the correlations and attenuation factors.4748

The valid and reliable assessment of dietary intake in youth with diabetes is of paramount importance both for research and practice. Because of the emphasis on medical nutrition therapy and carbohydrate counting,161820262937 youth with type 1 diabetes may have a heightened awareness of their diet and may potentially perform better on validity or reliability assessment. In comparison to other self-reported FFQs for youth, the SEARCH FFQ performed quite well both in terms of relative validity and reliability. A small number of food groups clearly need to be better assessed in future modifications of this instrument, including fats and oils and the bread, cereal, rice and pasta group, particularly with respect to high fiber foods. In addition, the 7-day recall period necessary for children may be a significant limitation, and researchers may wish to consider replicating the FFQ or collecting supplemental dietary data to overcome this limitation. This study furthermore illustrated the utility of measurement error modeling in the context of validating a dietary assessment instrument. While there is clearly some room for improvement in our questionnaire, our findings suggest that, with a few exceptions, the SEARCH FFQ will be useful in estimating associations between food group- or nutrient-based dietary exposures and outcomes in youth with type 1 diabetes in the SEARCH for Diabetes in Youth Study.
