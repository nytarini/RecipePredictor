FAHF-2 is a 9-herb formula based on Traditional Chinese Medicine that blocks
peanut anaphylaxis in a murine model. In Phase I studies, FAHF-2 was found to be safe,
and well tolerated.

Objective
To evaluate the safety and effectiveness of FAHF-2 as a treatment for food
allergy.

Methods
In this double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled study, 68 subjects, 12-45
years of age, with allergies to peanut, tree nut, sesame, fish, and/or shellfish,
confirmed by baseline double-blind, placebo controlled food challenge (DBPCFC), received
FAHF-2 (n=46) or placebo (n=22). After 6 months of therapy, subjects
underwent DBPCFC. For those who demonstrated increases in eliciting dose, a repeat
DBPCFC was performed 3 months after stopping therapy.

Results
Treatment was well-tolerated with no serious adverse events. By intent-to-treat
analysis, the placebo group had a higher eliciting dose and cumulative dose
(p=0.05) at the end of treatment DBPCFC. There was no difference in the
requirement for epinephrine to treat reactions (p=0.55). There were no
significant differences in allergen-specific IgE and IgG4, cytokine
production by PBMCs or basophil activation between active and placebo groups. In
vitro immunological studies performed on subject baseline PBMCs incubated
with FAHF-2 and food allergen produced significantly less IL-5, greater IL-10 and
increased numbers of Tregs than untreated cells. Notably, 44% of subjects had
poor drug adherence for at least one-third of the study period.

Conclusion
FAHF-2 is a safe herbal medication for food allergic individuals and shows
favorable in vitro immunomodulatory effects; however, efficacy for improving tolerance
to food allergens is not demonstrated at the dose and duration used.

   Introduction
Food allergy affects as many as 8% of young children and 5% of
adults.[1] Peanut allergy is the
leading cause of food-induced anaphylaxis in the U.S.[2] The standard of care for food allergy management entails strict
avoidance and immediate access to rescue medications,[3] and currently, there is no effective therapy or cure.

Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM) has been used in China to treat various diseases
for thousands of years, particularly in the form of herbal formulas. Recently, TCM has been
attracting interest in Western countries as a source of alternative or complementary therapy
for a variety of diseases, including allergies and asthma.[4-8] FAHF-2 is the
first botanical investigational new drug (IND) approved for clinical studies for food
allergy by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA). FAHF-2 is a 9-herb formula based on
the classical Chinese herbal formula Wu Mei Wan.[9] Murine model studies as well as phase I acute and
extended trials of FAHF-2 in patients with peanut, tree nut, fish and/or shellfish allergy
demonstrated that this formula is safe and well tolerated; and as seen in a murine model of
peanut allergy, it has beneficial immunoregulatory effects in vitro.[10-15]

Therefore, the aim of this study was to examine the safety and efficacy of FAHF-2
for the treatment of food allergy in a multi-center, randomized, double-blind,
placebo-controlled clinical trial. Based on previously published data, we proposed that the
therapeutic effect of FAHF-2 on food allergy is due to prevention of IgE triggered mast
cell/basophil activation and suppression of Th2 cell cytokine production. Thus, a secondary
aim was to examine the immunomodulatory effects of FAHF-2 in humans.

Methods
Study participants
Food allergic individuals ages 12-45 years of age with a convincing history of
allergy to peanut, tree nut (almond, cashew, hazelnut, pecan, pistachio, walnut), sesame,
fish (cod, tuna, salmon, catfish) or shellfish (crab, lobster, shrimp) as documented by a
positive skin test (mean wheal diameter ≥5 mm greater than the mean of saline
control) and/or food allergen-specific IgE level (IgE ≥ 0.7 kUA/L) and
positive double-blind, placebo controlled oral food challenge (DBPCFC) (total 2 grams of
protein) were eligible for the study. Only one food allergen was chosen to be studied
during the trial for each participant. Females of childbearing potential were included but
had to be sexually inactive or using effective birth control measures.

Subjects with a history of life-threatening anaphylaxis (involving hypotension
or requiring mechanical ventilation) were excluded. Additional exclusion criteria included
history of systemic disease that in the investigator's opinion would preclude the
subject from participating in this study (e.g. autoimmune disease, neoplasms, HIV or
hepatitis virus infection, bleeding disorders/diatheses, history of breast and/or ovarian
cancer); abnormal hepatic, bone marrow or renal function; clinically significant abnormal
electrocardiogram; current uncontrolled moderate to severe asthma with FEV1
&lt;80% predicted; drug or alcohol abuse; pregnancy or lactation; use of
omalizumab; and participation in another research protocol within the previous 30
days.

This study was approved by the Institutional Review Boards at each clinical
site. Subjects were recruited from 3 U.S. sites (Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai,
New York, NY; Arkansas Children's Hospital, Little Rock, AR; Ann and Robert H.
Lurie Children's Hospital of Chicago, Chicago, IL).

The study was conducted under an investigational new drug application to the
Food and Drug Administration (FDA) (77,468) and was monitored by an independent data and
safety monitoring board. Written informed consent was obtained prior to enrollment; assent
was obtained for children 12-17 years of age.

Study Design
This was a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial. Subjects were
randomized using a centralized computer generated algorithm to receive FAHF-2 or placebo
(2:1), 10 tablets three times a day for 6 months. The primary endpoint was the percentage
of subjects who could consume, without dose-limiting symptoms, 2 grams of protein or a
greater than a 4-fold increase in the allergen dose to induce a positive DBPCFC after
therapy compared to baseline. Secondary outcomes assessed the rate of adverse events as
well as immunologic parameters.

The screening evaluation entailed a medical history, physical examination, skin
prick testing, food-specific IgE testing, pulmonary function test, electrocardiogram,
urinalysis, and routine laboratory blood tests (complete blood count, serum chemistries,
renal function, liver function tests, and pregnancy test for female participants).
Subjects underwent a baseline DBPCFC (up to 2 grams protein).

Subjects continued food allergen avoidance and refrained from other herbal
medication use. Subjects were contacted by telephone weekly for the first 4 weeks, then
every 2 weeks to assess medication adherence and potential adverse events (AEs). Interval
history, physical examination, laboratory tests, and symptom diary were evaluated every 8
weeks at study visits.

Post-therapy, a 5 gram protein DBPCFC was performed. Subjects who demonstrated
an improvement in challenge eliciting dose (amount of food allergen that could be consumed
without dose-limiting symptoms) as defined for the primary endpoint returned for a DBPCFC
3 months off therapy to assess for sustained effect.

Study Medication
FAHF-2 tablets (0.5g/tablet) were produced by Xiyuan Chinese Medicine Research
and Pharmaceutical Manufacturer, China. The quality of raw herbs, manufacturing process
and quality control of the final FAHF-2 product was established according to FDA guidance
under the botanical drug title (Chemical, Manufacturing, and Control Data [21 CFR
312.23(a) (7)]) as published previously.[14]

Placebo tablets were identical in appearance, but contained corn starch (0.55
g/tablet). These tablets were manufactured by the same company as FAHF-2.

Study procedures
Skin prick testing
Endpoint titrated skin prick tests (SPTs) with serial 10-fold dilutions were
performed at baseline and after the treatment phase. The standard extracts (1:20 wt/vol)
of stock peanut, tree nuts (almond, cashew, hazelnut, pecan, pistachio, walnut), sesame,
fish (cod, tuna, salmon, catfish) or shellfish (crab, lobster, shrimp) (Greer
Laboratories; Lenoir, NC) were used. Negative controls (phenol-saline solution) and
positive controls (1 mg/ml histamine base) were also included. SPTs were performed by
pricking with a GreerPick (Greer Laboratories) through a drop of extract placed on the
volar aspect of the forearm. The mean of the largest orthogonal diameters of the wheal
was recorded. A wheal diameter at least 3 mm greater than the negative control was
considered a positive response.

DBPCFC
At baseline and post-therapy, subjects underwent DBPCFC which entailed
gradually feeding increasing amounts of the food allergen to a maximum of 2 grams
(baseline DBPCFC) or 5 grams (post-therapy DBPCFCs) protein at 10-15 minute intervals
under supervision. All sites used the same procedure. The doses were distributed in the
following manner: 2 grams (1, 5, 15, 50, 75, 100, 250, 500, and 1000 mg) and 5 grams (1,
5, 15, 50, 75, 100, 250, 500, 1000, 1250, and 1750 mg).

A DBPCFC was considered positive when a subject developed cutaneous
(urticaria, angioedema, and/or flushing), gastrointestinal (abdominal cramping,
vomiting, and/or diarrhea), respiratory (persistent nasal congestion, persistent
rhinorrhea, persistent sneezing, tightness in the throat, dysphonia, dyspnea, and/or
wheezing), neurologic (change in activity level and/or confusion) and/or cardiovascular
(dizziness, loss of consciousness, and/or hypotension) symptoms. DBPCFCs were also
stopped if persistent subjective symptoms were reported.

Immunological Studies
Allergen-specific IgE and IgG4 measurements
At each study visit, allergen-specific IgE (sIgE) to the study food allergen
was measured using ImmunoCAP® (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham,
MA). At baseline and post-therapy, allergen-specific IgG4 (sIgG4)
was measured using ImmunoCAP®.

Cytokine profiles and basophil activation
At baseline and post-therapy, serum cytokine profiles and basophil activation
(ex vivo studies) were determined in both active and placebo subjects
(Repository Methods E1 and E2).[19,20]

In order to assess the response to direct exposure to FAHF-2 and predict
clinical outcome, in vitro studies were performed. PBMCs obtained from
subjects at baseline (pre-treatment) were incubated with FAHF-2 plus food allergen
in vitro, and cytokine profiles and T regulatory cell numbers were
determined to correlate cellular responses to FAHF-2 with clinical outcome. (Repository
Methods E3).[14,16]

Safety Monitoring
Subjects were monitored for potential AEs based on criteria approved by the FDA
that were adapted from the World Health Organization (WHO) Recommendations for Grading of
Acute and Subacute Toxicity.[14]

Statistical Analysis
A sample size of 68 subjects (allowing for a 20% drop out rate) would
yield 36 active and 18 placebo evaluable patients, providing a power of 83% to
detect a difference between an estimated 60% success rate in meeting the primary
endpoint in the active group and 20% success rate in the placebo group, using a
two-tailed Chi-Square test of equal proportions at a 5% level of significance. The
predicted success rate in the placebo group was based on a prior study where a greater
than 4-fold increase in threshold dose was reported in 20% of the placebo
group.[17]

Comparison of categorical data was performed with Fisher's exact test
with a 2-tailed p value, while comparison of continuous data was performed with a t-test.
Analysis of Covariance (ANCOVA) models were used to assess whether the change from
baseline to post-therapy in various outcome variables (sIgE, sIgG4, IL-5,
IL-10, IFN- γ, basophil activation, SPTs) differed between treatment
groups.[18] The change in the
outcome was the dependent variable and the following were independent variables: treatment
group, baseline value, treatment-by-baseline interaction, adherence to treatment, and
clinical center. In addition, random-effects models were used to evaluate the longitudinal
responses for each of the outcome variables.[19] These models included responses at 2, 4, 6, and 9 months after
treatment initiation, and in addition to the independent variables listed in the models
above, time was a predictor variable as well as the interaction between time and treatment
group. This interaction term assessed whether time trends in response differed between
treatment groups.

Statistical analyses for the in vitro immunologic studies were
performed using a left censored log-normal repeated measure tobit model and a mixed model
with a random intercept on natural log transformed Treg percentages.

All analyses were conducted using SAS v. 9.2.

Results
Subject characteristics
Sixty-eight subjects were randomized; one withdrew within the first 4 weeks and
was replaced per protocol (Figure 1). The median age
of the subjects was 16 years (range 12-44 years), and 61.7% were males (Table 1). Peanut was the study allergen for
73.5%. Twenty-six (38.2%) had a history of food-induced anaphylaxis.
Subjects were highly atopic: 88.2% had multiple food allergies 73.5% had
asthma, 70.6% had allergic rhinitis, and 51.5% had atopic dermatitis.

At the baseline DBPCFC, there were no differences in eliciting dose, cumulative
dose or requirement for epinephrine between treatment groups (Table 1). Furthermore, eliciting dose did not vary by food.

Clinical outcomes
Fifty-nine subjects (86.8%) completed 6 months of treatment. One did not
return for the post-therapy DBPCFC, leaving 58 evaluable subjects. There was no
significant difference between active and placebo groups in terms of completing the study
(37 active, 21 placebo, p=0.09). Based on the primary endpoint parameters set
forth in the protocol, significantly more placebo-treated subjects met the primary
endpoint of having improvements in consumed allergen dose at the post-therapy DBPCFC as
compared to those on treatment (45.5% success in the placebo group vs
17.4% success in the active group, p=0.01). Using intent-to-treat (ITT)
analysis, the placebo group had a trend for higher eliciting dose and cumulative dose at
the post-therapy DBPCFC (p=0.07) (Table 1,
Figure 2). There was no difference in the
requirement for epinephrine to treat reactions (p=0.55) (Table 1). Adjusting for adherence also did not alter these
results.

Subset analyses of Caucasian race (87% of subjects) and peanut allergy
(74%) showed no difference between treatment groups for the primary endpoint of
improvement in consumed allergen dose at the post-therapy DBPCFC (16.7% success in
the active group vs. 33.3% in the placebo group p=0.17; 14.7%
success in the active group vs. 37.5% in the placebo group, p=0.14,
respectively). No differences in eliciting or cumulative doses at baseline and
post-therapy DBPCFC were observed in these subgroups.

For those meeting the primary endpoint, a repeat 5 gram DBPCFC was performed 3
months off treatment. Eight from the active group and 10 from the placebo group met this
criterion. Two from the placebo group declined to participate in this DBPCFC. There was no
significant difference between groups for persistence of effect (5 of 8 active vs 3 of 10
placebo; ITT p=0.34).

Additional post hoc analyses were performed using more
stringent criteria as used in the NIH-funded Consortium of Food Allergy Research (CoFAR)
study protocols including:1) must tolerate at least 500 mg of food protein if subject
tolerated 0-25 mg at baseline food challenge; 2) must tolerate at least a 10-fold increase
in food protein if tolerated 75-250 mg at baseline food challenge; 3) must tolerate 5 gm
or more of food protein if tolerated &gt;500 mg at baseline). Using these criteria,
there was no difference between active and placebo groups in achieving improved tolerance
(2% success in the active group vs 13.6% success in the placebo group,
p=0.08). In addition, there was no difference in persistence of effect.

Adherence to therapy
Adherence was assessed based on the number of tablets taken (calculated by
number of tablets returned subtracted from the number dispensed) in relation to the
expected number taken during the study time frame (study visits occurred every 2 months).
Subjects were considered adherent if medication completion was ≥ 80%.
Non-adherence increased over the course of the study; 44% of subjects had poor
adherence for at least one-third of the study period (Table 2). There was no difference in adherence between active and placebo groups
(p=0.17).

Clinical Adverse Events
A total of 387 adverse events (AEs) were reported; none were severe. There was
no difference in the number of AEs reported per subject between active and placebo groups
(Table 3). Gastrointestinal complaints were most
common. There was no difference between groups in terms of the proportion of
gastrointestinal complaints that were associated with study medication dosing (active:
16/61, placebo: 6/22, p=0.80)

Nine subjects withdrew from the study (Figure
1): 4 cited difficulties with compliance, 4 had persistent abdominal complaints,
1 developed a new rash for which the subject wanted to pursue Chinese herbal treatment
prescribed by the subject's acupuncturist. All subjects who withdrew due to
persistent abdominal complaints were on active treatment. One of these subjects was an
early drop-out (within the first 4 weeks) and was replaced as per protocol. For this
subject and one other, symptoms resolved within 2 weeks of discontinuing study medication;
no other interventions were required. For the remaining 2 subjects, one was subsequently
diagnosed with non-celiac gluten sensitivity that responded well to a gluten-free diet;
the other was diagnosed with a peptic ulcer and symptoms resolved after starting
lansoprazole. The subject with new rash had been randomized to active treatment. Two
subjects in the active group were lost to follow-up; 1 completed treatment, but did not
finish the DBPCFC due to scheduling conflicts.

Immunological test results
There were no differences between treatment groups at baseline and at the end of
therapy for all laboratory parameters measured. Pulmonary function studies and
electrocardiogram findings did not change following treatment.

While a significant decrease in basophil activation at 200ng/mL in the active
group from baseline to the end of the study (p=0.004) was observed, there was no
significant difference in the change for this parameter when comparing the active and
placebo groups (p=0.1). There were no significant changes in sIgE,
sIgG4, sIgE/sIgG4 ratio, and IL-10 and IFN- γ levels
between treatment groups (Table 4). A significant
increase in IL-5 was observed in the active group, but no change was seen in the placebo
group. In addition, sIgE levels did not change over time in either treatment group, and
there was no difference between slopes (p=0.9859). Adjusting for adherence did not
change these results.

No difference in baseline median SPT was detected between groups (Table 1). Endpoint titration SPTs before and after treatment
comparisons found a greater median change for the area under the SPT endpoint titration
curve for the placebo group compared to the active group (p=0.03).

In Vitro Immunomodulatory Effects of FAHF-2 on PBMCs obtained at baseline
In order to assess the response to direct exposure to FAHF-2 and predict
clinical outcome, in vitro studies were performed with PBMCs obtained
from subjects at baseline. In the initial experiments, we tested 2 doses. As shown in
Figure 3A. Ag+250 μg/mL of FAHF-2
showed significantly lower levels of IL-5 and higher levels of IL-10 compared to cultures
with allergen alone (n=12). There was no difference in cytokine levels between
PBMCs cultured with Ag alone and Ag+125 μg/mL FAHF-2. We then determined
the effects of 250 μg/mL of FAHF-2 and found a reduction in IL-5 and increase in
IL-10 (Allergen+FAHF-2 vs. Allergen, p&lt;0.05, n=53, Figure 3B) Significantly increased number of
CD4+CD25+ FoxP3+ T regulatory
cells was exhibited in the FAHF-2 treated condition (FAHF-2+Allergen vs. Allergen,
p&lt;0.05, n=10, Figure 4).

Discussion
FAHF-2 is a 9-herb formula that is highly safe and effective in murine models of
peanut and multiple food allergies.[10-13] Based on the favorable results of the acute
and extended phase I studies,[14,15] we performed a multi-center, randomized,
double-blind, placebo-controlled phase II clinical trial to assess safety and efficacy in
food allergic individuals.

The results of this study did not demonstrate efficacy of FAHF-2 using a dose of
10 tablets three times a day for 6 months. There was also no significant difference over
time within groups or between groups for the other immunologic parameters examined.

Our results provide further support of the safety of this herbal medication, with
no differences observed between groups in terms of adverse events, routine laboratory
parameters, pulmonary function studies or electrocardiograms. Although no differences in
gastrointestinal side effects were reported between groups, 4 subjects receiving active
treatment withdrew due to gastrointestinal complaints, suggesting that the number of tablets
and/or herbal medication may adversely affect certain individuals. However, of those who
were able to complete 6 months of therapy, adherence to study medication was no different
between treatment groups.

A significant limitation to this study was the unequal rates of withdrawal
(21% in the active group vs. 5% of the placebo group), which can limit
assessments of safety and efficacy. Several additional limitations may have affected our
ability to detect efficacy. First, the dose used was based on an extrapolation from the
effective murine dose using body surface area while also considering the tablet burden that
can negatively impact adherence. In this trial, 80% of the full murine dose was
chosen, which was 10 tablets three times a day. This high tablet load posed a significant
burden on subjects, contributing to drop-out as well as low adherence. Nearly half of the
subjects had &lt;80% medication adherence for at least 2 months of the 6 month
study and a third were non-adherent during 4-6 months just before the post-therapy DBPCFC.
Thus, suboptimal dosing may contribute to the lack of efficacy seen in this clinical trial.
Second, the treatment duration was suboptimal. To achieve a comparable duration to the 7
week treatment in the mouse, 2-3 years of therapy would be required in humans. Data from
oral immunotherapy studies also indicate that longer treatment durations are likely to be
more effective for well-established food allergy.[20,21]

Animal studies also suggest that concurrent allergen exposure may be necessary for
efficacy of FAHF-2. In the murine experiments, the mice were exposed to allergen monthly
throughout the study.[12] In this
clinical trial, subjects were instructed to maintain strict allergen avoidance, and thus,
did not receive concurrent allergen exposure.

Consistent with previous findings,[14] PBMCs cultured with FAHF-2 switched from antigen-induced Th2 to
Th1/Treg predominant responses. A higher number of CD4+CD25+Foxp3+
Treg cells were present in FAHF-2+antigen cultures than in cultures with allergen
alone. The discrepancy between in vitro and ex vivo
results may be due to direct exposure to sufficient amounts of active compounds in
vitro that was not replicated in vivo under the current clinical
study conditions, suggesting that optimizing the treatment dose and more effectively
ensuring compliance will be necessary to achieve clinical efficacy.

Results from published food therapy studies indicate that additional factors may
influence the ability to modulate the immune system toward tolerance. Oral immunotherapy
(OIT) and sublingual immunotherapy (SLIT) studies suggest that an older age at the start of
treatment may result in more difficulty achieving desensitization, as success rates tended
to be higher in studies that included primarily younger children.[22-24] Furthermore,
in 2 studies that included children with a history of anaphylaxis, lower success rates for
desensitization were observed in comparison to studies that excluded those with a history of
anaphylaxis.[25,26] Subjects in our study were older, with a median age of
16 years, and over a third had a history of anaphylaxis, thus our study population may need
optimized doses and prolonged treatment to impact their established allergy.

While the results of this study do not demonstrate clinical efficacy at this dose
and duration, several lessons can be learned, in particular, the importance of selecting
clinically meaningful endpoint criteria and trial design. Clinically relevant endpoints are
necessary as small improvements in cumulative dose in a positive DBPCFC do not provide
sufficient protection in case of a true accidental exposure. Using our original endpoint
parameters, significantly more placebo-treated subjects experienced improvements in
tolerance after 6 months. However, post-hoc analyses using the criteria from the CoFAR group
[24] showed no difference between
treatment groups. This is due to several subjects being categorized as improved based on
small incremental increases in their dose consumed without symptoms during the DBPCFC using
the original endpoint parameters, which are likely to be clinically irrelevant. This also
suggests that eliciting and cumulative dose may vary over time without treatment.

The need for well-designed, placebo-controlled studies is supported by our
observation of clinical improvements in several subjects who received placebo treatment over
the relatively short period of this study. Spontaneous tolerance has also been reported in
adolescents in a peanut SLIT study.[24] In recent peanut OIT studies, the improvement rate in placebo groups
varied between 0-15%.[27-29] Spontaneous tolerance to tree nuts and
fish/shellfish are generally reported to be 9% and 1-2%,
respectively.[3] In this study, the
improvement rate in the placebo group is higher than previously reported. The reason for
this is unknown, requiring further investigation, but study design is known to influence
clinical trial success as well. Higher placebo responses have been observed in studies where
the chances of receiving active treatment exceed 50% because there is a high
expectation of improvement, [30,31] thus leading to poor discrimination between
treatment groups. This study randomized subjects 2:1 active to placebo (67% chance
of receiving active treatment) in part because of the observation that prospective
participants in other food therapy trials with 1:1 randomization schemes were declining
participation due to a high likelihood of receiving placebo treatment. In retrospect, this
study design may have contributed to our observation that more placebo subjects experienced
an increase in cumulative tolerated dose at the post-therapy DBPCFC.

In summary, this study demonstrates that FAHF-2 is a safe herbal medication for
food allergic individuals; however, efficacy was not demonstrated at the dose and duration
used. Future studies will optimize doses and employ longer treatment durations using the
refined formula that has recently been developed which will require fewer
tablets.[32] This will also
facilitate improved adherence. Improved study design as well as combination therapy to
provide concurrent allergen exposure, as in OIT, may enhance our ability to demonstrate
efficacy of this herbal product for food allergy.

Figure 2 Cumulative tolerated at oral food challenge at baseline and after the 6 month treatment
period comparing active and placebo treated groups. The mean cumulative dose tolerated by
the active group at baseline was 266.2 mg (95% CI, 150.3-382.1) and at 6 months
was 369.2 mg (95% CI, 47.0-691.4). The mean cumulative dose tolerated by the
placebo group at baseline was 352.5 mg (95% CI, 108.5-596.5) and at 6 months was
1022.lmg (95% CI, 326.4-1717.8).

Figure 3 FAHF-2 suppressed IL-5 and increased IL-10 in vitro. A. PBMCs (4
× 105) from subjects (n=12) were obtained at the baseline visit
and cultured in AIM-V media alone, with relevant allergen (200μ/ml),
allergen+FAHF-2 (125 or 250μg/ml). After a 3 day culture, culture
supernatants were harvested and IL-5, IFN-γ and IL-10 levels were measured by
ELISA. Cell viability was determined by trypan blue dye exclusion. B: IL-5 IL-10 and
IFN-γ production from PBMCs obtained at baseline with or without FAHF-2 in
vitro culture (n=53). Cultures were conducted as described in Fig 3A. Data are shown as mean ±
SEM and analyzed using a left censored log-normal repeated measures tobit model.
*P &lt; .05, Allergen versus Allergen+FAHF-2.

Figure 4 FAHF-2 increased number of T regulatory cells in vitro. PBMCs from
subjects obtained at baseline were cultured as described in Figure 2. After a 3 day culture, numbers of CD4+CD25+
Foxp3+ Tregs were determined by flow cytometry. Data were analyzed by using FlowJo
software. A, Dot plots are representative of an individual subject.
