Enterococcus faecalis is a Gram-positive, facultative anaerobic bacterium that is associated with failed endodontic cases and nosocomial infections. E. faecalis can form biofilms, penetrate dentinal tubules and survive in root canals with scarce nutritional supplies. These properties can make E. faecalis resistant to conventional endodontic disinfection therapy. Furthermore, treatment may be complicated by the fact that many E. faecalis strains are resistant to antibiotics. A potential alternative to antibiotic therapy is phage therapy. ϕEf11 is a temperate phage that infects strains of E. faecalis. It was previously sequenced and genetically engineered to modify its properties in order to render it useful as a therapeutic agent in phage therapy. In the current study, we have further genetically modified the phage to create phage ϕEf11/ϕFL1C(Δ36)PnisA. The aim of this study was to evaluate the efficacy of bacteriophage ϕEf11/ϕFL1C(Δ36)PnisA, to disrupt biofilms of two Enterococcus faecalis strains: JH2-2 (vancomycin-sensitive) and V583 (vancomycin-resistant).

Methods
24 hour static biofilms of E. faecalis strains JH2-2(pMSP3535 nisR/K) and V583 (pMSP3535nisR/K), formed on cover slips, were inoculated with bacteriophage ϕEf11/ϕFL1C(Δ36)PnisA. After 24 and 48 hours incubation, the bacterial biomass was imaged by confocal microscopy and viable cells were quantified by colony forming unit measurement.

Results
The results showed a 10-100-fold decrease in viable cells (CFU/biofilm) after phage treatment, which was consistent with comparisons of treated and untreated biofilm images visualized as max projections of the Z-series.

Conclusion
The biomass of both vancomycin-sensitive and vancomycin-resistant E. faecalis biofilms is markedly reduced following infection by bacteriophage ϕEf11/ϕFL1C(Δ36)PnisA.

   1. Introduction
Enterococcus faecalis is a Gram-positive, facultative anaerobic bacterium that has been found in the oral cavity in association with periodontal disease (Rams, Feik, Young, Hammond, &amp; Slots, 1992) and endodontic infections (Molander, Reit, Dahlén, &amp; Kvist, 1998; Peciuliene, Balciuniene, Eriksen, &amp; Haapasalo, 2000; Pinheiro et al., 2003).

While this organism is generally related to commensal life in the gastrointestinal tract, (Facklam, 2002) it can also cause systemic opportunistic infections (Gilmore &amp; Ferretti, 2003; Hunt, 1998; Jett, Huycke, &amp; Gilmore, 1994; Moellering Jr, 1992; Woodford, 1998) that can be difficult to eliminate due to its abilities to form mature biofilms (Distel, Hatton, &amp; Gillespie, 2002; Mohamed &amp; Huang, 2007; Rams et al., 1992) and survive in hostile environments with scarce nutritional supplies and extreme alkaline pH's (Figdor, Davies, &amp; Sundqvist, 2003; McHugh, Zhang, Michalek, &amp; Eleazer, 2004; Sedgley, Lennan, &amp; Appelbe, 2005; Stevens &amp; Grossman, 1983). In the oral cavity this organism has the ability to form biofilms in infected root canals as a monoinfection, without the support of other species (Fabricius, Dahlén, Holm, &amp; Möller, 1982; Siren, Haapasalo, Ranta, Salmi, &amp; Kerosuo, 1997). It is able to penetrate dentinal tubules and remain in the root canal wall (Hubble, Hatton, Nallapareddy, Murray, &amp; Gillespie, 2003; Love, 2001) thereby rendering it more resistant to conventional endodontic disinfection therapies which require direct contact. E. faecalis has been frequently associated with failed endodontic cases (Molander et al., 1998; Peciuliene et al., 2000; Pinheiro et al., 2003; Ricucci &amp; Siqueira, 2010; Rôças, Siqueira, &amp; Santos, 2004) and its presence may prevent the repair process of apical periodontitis (Ricucci &amp; Siqueira, 2010; Stuart, Schwartz, Beeson, &amp; Owatz, 2006). Further complicating treatment of infections by this organism (and its close relative, E. faecium) is the emergence of multidrug-resistant (MDR) strains (Arias &amp; Murray, 2009; Bonten, Willems, &amp; Weinstein, 2001; Cetinkaya, Falk, &amp; Mayhall, 2000; Gold &amp; Moellering Jr, 1996; Noskin, 1997; Uttley, Collins, Naidoo, &amp; George, 1988). Multidrug resistance among pathogenic microorganisms is an important topic of global health concern nowadays, as diseases previously thought to be eradicated can once again jeopardize human life. Consequently, alternative antimicrobial strategies for oral, as well as systemic infections by MDR bacteria are urgently needed. One such alternative to antibiotic treatment, is phage therapy: The use of virulent bacterial viruses (phages/bacteriophages) to control infections by their pathogenic host cells (Burrowes, Harper, Anderson, McConville, &amp; Enright, 2011; Sulakvelidze, Alavidze, &amp; Morris, 2001; Summers, 2001). In this regard, we previously isolated a bacteriophage, ØEf11, that we induced from a root canal isolate of E. faecalis (Stevens, Porras, &amp; Delisle, 2009). Subsequently, we sequenced and annotated the genome of this phage (Stevens, Ektefaie, &amp; Fouts, 2011) and then genetically engineered it (Zhang, Fouts, DePew, &amp; Stevens, 2013) to modify its properties in order to render it useful as a therapeutic agent in phage therapy. Several iterations of genetic constructs of phage ϕEf11 have been produced in the course of our genetic engineering of the phage. In the present work, we have further modified one of these ϕEf11 derivatives to produce phage ϕEf11/ϕFL1C(Δ36)PnisA. This derivative features the replacement of five open reading frames (ORFs) of phage ϕEf11 by 5 ORFs of a ϕFL1C prophage, deletion of the CI repressor determinant (ORF36), and the replacement of the wild type promoter controlling lytic cycle functions with a nisin-inducible promoter. The product of these genetic modifications [phage ϕEf11/ϕFL1C(Δ36)PnisA] is a phage that is incapable of lysogeny, insensitive to repression by the CI gene product, and has a much wider host range than the wild type virus (phage ϕEf11), but cannot initiate lytic infection in the absence of nisR, nisK, the determinants of the two component system that regulates the PnisA nisin promoter (Bryan, Bae, Kleerebezem, &amp; Dunny, 2000; Kuipers, Beerthuyzen, de Ruyter, Luesink, &amp; de Vos, 1995). Since the properties of the genetically engineered virus [phage ϕEf11/ϕFL1C(Δ36)PnisA] are markedly different from the wild type phage (phage ϕEf11), we wished to evaluate the efficacy of phage ϕEf11/ϕFL1C(Δ36)PnisA to disrupt biofilms of two E. faecalis strains: JH2-2 (vancomycin sensitive) and V583 (vancomycin resistant).

2. Material &amp; Methods
2.1 Bacterial strains, and growth conditions
E. faecalis JH2-2 (fusidic acid and rifampin resistant, vancomycin sensitive) was originally isolated by Jacob &amp; Hobbs (Jacob &amp; Hobbs, 1974). E. faecalis V583 (vancomycin resistant) was originally isolated by Sahm et al. (Sahm, Kissinger, Gilmore, Murray, Mulder, Solliday &amp; Clarke,1989). Both strains were grown in brain heart infusion (BHI) broth, and transformed with plasmid pMSP3535, cat, nisR nisK, using procedures previously described (Zhang et al., 2013). JH2-2[ϕEf11(Δ61-1, ϕFL1C40-44)] is a lysogenic E. faecalis strain harboring prophage ϕEf11(Δ61-1, ϕFL1C40-44), that was prepared previously (Zhang et al., 2013). E. faecalis JH2-2(pMSP3535, cat, nisR/K) was prepared by transforming strain JH2-2 with plasmid (pMSP3535, cat, nisR/K), and selecting transformants on chloramphenicol-containing media. nisR/K are the determinants for the two-component system for regulating the PnisA nisin promotor (Bryan et al., 2000; Kuipers et al., 1995) and cat (chloramphenicol acetyl transferase) was used as a selection marker. E. faecalis V583(pMSP3535,cat nisR/K) was prepared in a similar manner, substituting E. faecalis V583 for strain JH2-2.

2.2. Construction of phage ϕEf11/ϕFL1C(Δ36)PnisA
A recombinant plasmid containing a 1kb DNA fragment upstream of ϕEF11 ORF36, a nisin promoter (PnisA), plus an erythromycin selection marker (erm), and a 1kb fragment downstream of phage ϕEf11 Pcro (the wild type promoter controlling lytic cycle functions in phage ϕEf11) was constructed essentially as described previously (Zhang et al., 2013). This plasmid was electroporated into a competent strain of E. faecalis JH2-2[ϕEf11(Δ61-1, ϕFL1C40-44], harboring the spontaneous recombinant prophage ϕEf11(Δ61-1,ϕFL1C40-44) (Zhang et al., 2013). Following homologous recombination, transformant JH2-2[ϕEf11(Δ61-1, ϕFL1C40-44, Δ36, erm, ΔPcro, PnisA)] clones were selected on erythromycin-containing BHI agar plates. The presence of ϕEf11 ORF31, erm, PnisA, and the absence of ORF36 and Pcro in these cells, were confirmed by PCR analysis. The primers and predicted amplicon sizes are shown in table 1. These mutant lysogenic clones, which will be referred to as E. faecalis JH2-2[ϕEf11/ϕFL1C(Δ36)PnisA], were subsequently transformed with pMSP3535-cat, nisR/K, a plasmid that harbors the two-component nisR/K system for regulating the PnisA promotor in phage ϕEf11/ϕFL1C(Δ36)PnisA, and a chloramphenicol selection marker (cat). Induction of E. faecalis JH2-2[ϕEf11/ϕFL1C(Δ36)PnisA](pMSP3535-cat,nisR/K) by the addition of nisin yielded phage ϕEf11/ϕFL1C(Δ36)PnisA.

2.3. Preparation of phage suspensions
Lysogenic E. faecalis JH2-2[ϕEf11/ϕFL1C(Δ36)PnisA](pMSP3535, cat,nisR/K) was grown in BHI broth at 37° C to early log phase. Nisin (40ng/mL) was then added to the culture to induce the phage, and incubation was continued for an additional 8 hours. The resulting lysate was clarified by centrifugation (10,000 × g × 10 min) and the phage was then collected by centrifugation (100,000 × g × 90 min). The resulting phage pellet was resuspended in SM buffer (0.58% NaCl, 0.2% MgSO4 • 7 H2O, 0.05M Tris-HCl pH 7.5, 0.01% gelatin) (Sambrook, Fritsch, &amp; Maniatis, 1989) containing nisin (40ng/mL), and filtered through a sterile 0.45 μ filter. The phage suspension was then plaque-assayed in the presence of nisin (40ng/mL) using E. faecalis JH2-2(pMSP3535, cat, nisR/K) as an indicator strain. The titer of this phage suspension was 5.8 × 109pfu/mL.

2.4. Static Biofilm Study
Sterile circular glass coverslips (12-mm diameter) were placed on the bottom of wells of 24-well round-bottom tissue culture plates (Techno Plastic Products, Switzerland) and covered with 2 ml of a 1:10 dilution of a BHI broth culture of E. faecalis [either JH2-2(pMSP3535, cat, nisR/K) or V583(pMSP3535,cat nisR/K)], prepared from an overnight culture grown at 37° C. After incubation at 37° C for an additional 48 hours to permit the formation of a biofilm, the medium (and planktonic cells) in each well was removed, and the adherent biofilm was gently rinsed three times with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS). Following the final rinse, the biofilm was covered with 200 μL of SM buffer (controls) or SM buffer containing phage ϕEf11/ϕFL1C(Δ36)PnisA (5.8 × 109pfu/mL). The cultures (both controls and phage-inoculated) were then incubated at 37° C for 1 hour to allow phage adsorption. 1.8 ml of BHI (supplemented with nisin and Chloramphenicol) was added to each well, and the plates were maintained at 37° C for an additional 24 or 48 hours, at which time the supernatant was removed, the biofilms were gently washed two times with PBS, and the biofilms were stained using live/dead dyes (Syto 9/Propidium Iodide/PBS) and imaged by confocal microscopy. Parallel cultures were also used to determine residual biomass by measuring E. faecalis colony forming units.

2.5. Confocal laser scanning microscopy
Confocal microscopy was performed on E. faecalis biofilms grown on the glass coverslips. After being washed three times with 1 ml of PBS, the coverslips were mounted onto microscope slides (face down) containing a drop of staining mixture (300 μl of PBS, 1 μl of Syto9, 1 μl of Propidium Iodine), and sealed with clear nail polish. Biofilms were visualized using a confocal microscope (Leica DM IRE2 Confocal Microscope with Sp5 data analysis, Leica Microsystems, Danaher, Wetzlar, Germany). The biofilms were imaged with Z-stack series taken every 0.5 μm through the biofilm and images were visualized as max projections of the Z-series.

2.6. Bacterial viability quantitation
The coverslips, containing the biofilms, were gently washed two times with PBS, then they were taken from the wells with sterile tweezers, and placed in 3 ml PBS in a 15-ml, centrifuge tube, which was kept on ice. A sonicator (Sonic Dismembrator, model 550; Fisher Scientific, Pittsburgh, US) was used for 20 seconds at a voltage amplitude of approximately 4.5 to disperse bacteria from the biofilm. Following sonication, the resulting 3 ml bacterial suspension from each biofilm was serially diluted 10-fold, and 20μl aliquots from each dilution were placed on modified thallous acetate (TA) agar plates (proteose peptone 1%, yeast extract 1 %, glucose 1 %, TA 0.2 %, triphenyl tetrazolium chloride 0.01 %, agar 1.3 %), which is selective for enterococci (Holt J. G. and Krieg H. R., 1994). Plates were incubated overnight at 37° C, and the colony forming unit titer was determined from colony counts.

3. Results
3.1. Bacteriophage Ef11/ϕFL1C(Δ36)PnisA
Confirmation of the presence of the ϕEf11/ϕFL1C(Δ36)PnisA prophage in E. faecalis JH2-2[Ef11/ϕFL1C(Δ36)PnisA] lysogens was made by PCR analysis. ORF36-specific primers failed to produce an amplicon using E. faecalis JH2-2[ϕEf11/ϕFL1C(Δ36)PnisA] DNA as a template, however, an amplicon of the predicted size (1,102 bp) was produced using nisin promoter-specific primers (Fig 1). Furthermore, in the absence of nisin, no phage could be detected in cultures of E. faecalis JH2-2[ϕEf11/ϕFL1C(Δ36)PnisA](pMSP3535, cat, nisR nisK), whereas with the addition of nisin (40ng/mL), phage was induced, producing a titer of 2.4 × 107 (Table 2).

3.2. Effect of bacteriophage on E. faecalis biofilms
The effect of phage ϕEf11/ϕFL1C(Δ36,)PnisA on biofilms of E. faecalis strains JH2-2(pMSP3535, cat, nisR nisK) and V583(pMSP3535, cat, nisR nisK) can be seen in Fig 2. Confocal Microscopic analysis revealed a major reduction of the bacterial population of both JH2-2 (pMSP3535, cat, nisR nisK) and V583 (pMSP3535, cat, nisR nisK) biofilms following phage infection, compared with the untreated control cultures. Dead cells (in red) and voids are much more abundant in phage-treated biofilms, while live cells (green) predominate in untreated biofilms, as shown in the Confocal images. Furthermore, dead cells can be seen throughout the depth of the biofilm layers in both the JH2-2 (pMSP3535, cat, nisR nisK) and V583 (pMSP3535, cat, nisR nisK) phage-treated cultures (Fig. 2 D, H).

A quantitative comparison was made between the control and the phage-treated biofilms. It can be seen (Table 3) that approximately 10-100-fold fewer viable cells were recovered from the phage treated biofilms, as compared to the untreated E. faecalis biofilms.

4. Discussion
The proliferation of antibiotic resistant strains among pathogenic bacteria has emphasized the urgent need for the development of new, alternative strategies for the management of bacterial infections. One such alternative that was considered nearly a century ago is that of phage therapy, or the use of bacterial viruses of pathogenic bacteria to infect and kill their host cells. The early successful implementation of antibiotics since the late 1940's blunted the initial interest in phage therapy in western medicine. However, with the growing emergence of antibiotic resistance, the therapeutic potential of phage therapy is now being reconsidered.

For a bacteriophage to be useful for phage therapy, it should feature certain biological properties. It should: (1) Be virulent, not temperate (i.e., incapable of lysogeny), (2) have a broad host range of strains within the targeted bacterial species, and (3) not contain genes for any toxic or pathogenic functions within its genome. We have previously described a successful three-step strategy for genetically engineering bacteriophages with these (and other desired) characteristics (Zhang et al., 2013). It consists of:
1) Transformation and allelic exchange in a lysogen to delete all lysogeny-related genes from the prophage and to replace the operator/promoter controlling the initiation of the lytic infection program with an inducible promoter. (Lysogens containing this recombinant prophage can be easily selected by inclusion of an appropriate antibiotic resistance marker in the allelic exchange that deletes the lysogeny-related genes. Furthermore, such a recombinant prophage will not be induced in the absence of the promoter's inducer).

2) Adding/replacing genes in the prophage to achieve the desired phenotypic characteristics. This may include the addition of genes that can alter host range specificity, or the deletion of genes that may be of pathogenic concern. Again, recombinant lysogens can be directly selected by the inclusion of an appropriate antibiotic resistance marker within the recombining DNA.

3) Replacing the inducible promoter (controlling phage lytic cycle functions) with a constitutive promoter found in the host cell genome. Upon replacement of the inducible promoter by the constitutive promoter, the phage productive infection cycle will be initiated resulting in the production of (mutant) progeny virions and lysis of the host cell. These (now virulent) progeny phage will be incapable of lysogeny (lacking lysogeny-related genes) and insensitive to repressor (lacking a repressor-sensitive lytic cycle promoter). In addition, they may display altered phenotypic characteristics (e.g., altered/broader host range) depending on what new genes have been introduced into the phage genome.



The bacteriophage used in this study was constructed using a portion of the above bioengineering strategy. The phage was engineered from a recombinant virus {phage [ϕEf11(Δ61-1, ϕFL1C40-44)]} that resulted from a spontaneous recombination event that occurred between bacteriophage ϕEf11 and a defective ϕFL1C prophage that was present in the E. faecalis JH2-2 chromosome (Zhang et al., 2013). An E. faecalis JH2-2[ϕEf11(Δ61-1,ϕFL1C40-44)](pMSP3535,cat,nisR,nisK) lysogen containing the ϕEf11(Δ61-1, ϕFL1C40-44) prophage and plasmid pMSP3535,cat,nisR,nisK, was transformed with a plasmid containing a 1kb DNA fragment upstream of ϕEF11 ORF36, the nisin promoter (PnisA), an erythromycin selection marker (erm), and a 1kb fragment downstream of phage ϕEf11 Pcro, the wild type lytic cycle promoter. Following homologous recombination, transformants were selected on erythromycin-containing agar plates. Broth cultures of these transformant clones were induced by the addition of nisin (40ng/mL). The resulting phage [ϕEf11/ϕFL1C(Δ36)PnisA] is no longer capable of lysogeny, due to the deletion of ORF 36 (the gene for the phage repressor), and is no longer sensitive to repression, due to the replacement of the wild type lytic cycle promoter (Pcro) by the inducible nisin promoter (PnisA). The activation of this promoter (PnisA) is dependent upon the presence of nisin and the products of the genes (nisR and nisK) of the two component nisin-sensory system (Bryan et al., 2000; Kuipers et al., 1995). In this nisin-controlled expression system, nisR and nisK are constitutively expressed via the nisR promoter. The nisK gene product is a histidine kinase, which, in the presence of nisin, autophosphorylates, and subsequently transfers the phosphate group to the nisR gene product, a response regulator. The phosphorylated NisR protein functions as a transcription factor that activates transcription from the nisA promoter (PnisA). Open reading frames immediately downstream from PnisA will then be transcribed (de Ruyter, Kuipers, Beerthuqzen, van Alen-Boerrigter &amp; de Vos 1996). We are using the nisA promoter (PnisA) to drive transcription of the genes of the bacteriophage lytic cycle. In this study, we provide the nisR and nisK genes in trans, from plasmid pMSP3535, cat, nisR nisK, in the host cells of the phage.

We recognize that in its current form, the phage engineered in the present study would not be clinically useful-additional genetic modifications will be required such as, replacing the inducible PnisA nisin promoter with a constitutive promoter and deleting the antibiotic resistance markers. In this regard, we are continuing to develop this (and similar) phage constructs with additional desirable properties. However, as an intermediate step in the development of an agent for use in phage therapy, we wished to examine the phage variant engineered in the present study for its ability to disrupt E. faecalis biofilms.

The images of the phage-treated E. faecalis biofilms (both vancomycin sensitive and resistant strains) are dramatically altered from the non-treated control biofilms, suggesting a gross disruption/reduction of the biofilm mass by the phage. This is true for both the surface projection images as well as the images through the depth of the biofilms. Considering the inherent resistance of biofilms to antimicrobial agents (Costerton, 2007), it is of some significance that we see cell death and biofilm disruption throughout the depth of the biofilms. The quantitative reduction (10−1-10−2) of viable cells in the treated, compared to the non-phage treated biofilms, while consistent with these observations, is not as impressive as the confocal biofilm images of the phage-disrupted biofilms. The sparsity of cells, most of which are stained red, seen in the imaged phage-treated biofilms, is consistent with the loss of biomass and preponderance of dead cells. The residual viable cells recovered from the phage-treated biofilms may be due to altered lytic infection kinetics of the genetically-modified phage. It is possible that the nisin promoter, previously installed in the phage genome to facilitate genetic modification of the prophage, is not as transcriptionally-efficient as the naturally occurring wild type promoter controlling the phage lytic cycle functions. This could result in a less robust lytic infection and a more modest reduction of the targeted bacterial population. Comparison of the lytic effects on E. faecalis populations of infections produced by phage with nisin promoters versus wild type promoters tends to support this contention (Zhang and Stevens, unpublished observations). If this is the case, we expect that replacement of the inducible nisin promoter by a strong, constitutive promoter to regulate phage lytic cycle functions will result in a greater lytic effect on the targeted host cell population.

Biofilms consist of a community of cells embedded in an extracellular polymeric matrix (EPM) (Costerton, 2007). In the case of E. faecalis, the EPM is thought to include extracellular DNA and dextran (Thomas, Thurlow, Boyle, &amp; Hancock, 2008; Thomas, Hiromasa, Harms, Thurlow, Tomich &amp; Hancock, 2009; Li,, Liu, &amp; Xu, 2012). It has been suggested that in order to effectively remove biofilms, it would be necessary to degrade the EPM as well as lyse/devitalize the cells. In this regard, it has been shown that E. faecalis biofilm formation can be reduced with treatment by dextranase and/or DNAase I (Li et al 2012). Furthermore, Lu and Collins (2007) demonstrated that bacteriophage delivery of an EPM-degrading enzyme (dispersin B) to an Escherichia coli biofilm reduced biofilm cell counts by approx. 4.5 orders of magnitude. Similarly, it is conceivable that the expression of a dextranase gene, cloned into the ϕEf11 bacteriophage genome, would further enhance the efficacy of the virus in removing E. faecalis biofilms. The genetic engineering strategy that we have devised using bacteriophage ϕEf11 provides a convenient platform upon which additional modifications, such as the insertion of a dextranse gene, can be made.

Bacteriophages that infect strains of E. faecalis have been known for more than fifty years (Evans 1934; Rogers &amp; Sarles 1963). The lytic/antimicrobial activities of many of these E. faecalis phages have been previously reported (Khalifa Brosh, Gelman, Coppenhagen-Glazer, Beyth, Poradosu-Cohen &amp; Hazan., 2015; Paisano, Spira, Cai, &amp; Bombana, 2004; Parasion, Kwiatek, Mizak, Gryko, Bartoszcze &amp; Kocik., 2012; Uchiyama, Rashel, Maeda, Takemura, Sugihara, Akechi &amp; Matsuzaki, 2008; Zhang et al., 2013). All of these were naturally-occurring bacteriophages, and none appear to be closely related (genetically) to ϕEf11/ϕFL1C(Δ36,)PnisA.

5. Conclusion
The biomass of both vancomycin-sensitive and vancomycin-resistant E. faecalis biofilms is markedly reduced following infection by bacteriophage ϕEf11/ϕFL1C(Δ36)PnisA.

HIGHLIGHTS
An exogenous inducible promoter controls the phage lytic cycle functions

Biofilms of both E. faecalis strains were disrupted by infection with bacteriophage

Confocal Microscopic analysis showed reduction of biomass in phage-treated biofilms

Dead cells could be seen throughout the depth of the phage-treated biofilm layers

A 10-100-fold decrease in viable cells was observed after bacteriophage treatment
