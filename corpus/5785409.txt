The present study was carried out to evaluate effect of natural anti-oxidants on the quality of mutton nuggets. Different blends of essential oil were evaluated for incorporation in mutton nuggets and it was found that Blend-1 had significantly higher sensory scores. Then, Blend-1 was tried at 0.25, 0.5 and 0.75% levels and product containing 0.25% level received significantly higher sensory scores. Thereafter, two combinations of flaxseed flour and 0.25% Blend-1 were tried viz., 4% flaxseed flour +&#xA0;0.25% Blend-1 and 8% flaxseed flour +&#xA0;0.25% Blend-1. Evaluation of sensory and physico-chemical properties were done in mutton nuggets incorporated with 0.25% Blend-1 (T-1) and selected combination (4% flaxseed flour +&#xA0;0.25% Blend-1) (T-2). T-2 had significantly higher dietary fiber and crude fiber than T-1 products. These products were then assessed for quality changes during storage at refrigerated temperature for 30&#xA0;days at 5&#xA0;days interval. Significantly lower TBARS values were recorded for treatment products than control at each interval of storage period. T-2 product showed significantly higher DPPH value than other products. Microbial count remained within the permissible limit of log104&#xA0;cfu/g for TPC, PC, yeast and mould count up to 15th day, 25th day and 30th day for control, T-1 and T-2 products, respectively. Essential oil and their combination incorporated mutton nuggets had about 10&#xA0;days longer shelf life than control.
