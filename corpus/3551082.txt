        Defatted groundnut cake obtained from commercial oil processing units and that prepared in laboratory oil expeller (LOE) were analyzed for quality parameters. Defatted groundnut cake flour (DGCF) was incorporated at 15&#x2013;100% levels in laddoo, chutney powder, fryums (deep fried crisp and crunchy item), biscuits, noodles and extruded snacks. The products were studied for sensory, physico-chemical and shelf-life quality. DGCF was creamish white with bulk density of 0.55&#x2009;&#xB1;&#x2009;0.03&#xA0;g/ml, water absorption capacity 135.6&#x2009;&#xB1;&#x2009;1.97&#xA0;ml %, oil absorption capacity 100.3&#x2009;&#xB1;&#x2009;1.16&#xA0;ml % and foam capacity 33&#x2009;&#xB1;&#x2009;1%. Protein, fat and ash contents were 51.6&#x2009;&#xB1;&#x2009;0.06, 4.5&#x2009;&#xB1;&#x2009;0.05 and 4.2&#x2009;&#xB1;&#x2009;0.11%, respectively. Tannins and aflatoxin B1 were not detected. The increase of protein due to incorporation of DGCF into the products ranged from 5.5 to 21.9%. Shelf-life studies indicated the maximum storability for 90&#xA0;days for all the products except laddoo, which could be stored for 30&#xA0;days at ambient temperature (28&#x2009;&#xB1;&#x2009;2&#xB0;C). All the products were acceptable and the order of preference for the products as indicated by adults (fryums, chutney powder, extruded snacks, noodles, biscuits and laddoo) and children (biscuits, laddoo, extruded snacks, fryums, noodles and chutney powder) varied.
