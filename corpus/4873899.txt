    The intention of many dietary assessment methods is to capture information on all foods
consumed, or at least those believed to make the largest contribution to total intake(

1

), in order to estimate total nutrient intake. For some purposes, this detailed
estimation of total nutrient intake may lead to collection of much redundant data. This is
particularly the case when assessing adherence with policy targets and messages such as
&#x2018;five-a-day&#x2019; portions of fruit and vegetables.
    The collection of substantial redundant information places unnecessary burden on research
participants and unnecessarily uses scarce research resources. To take a first step to
overcoming this problem, we applied data mining techniques to explore how many, and which,
foods intake information was required on to accurately predict achievement, or not, of key
dietary recommendations.

        Data mining, an overview
        Unlike traditional statistical approaches such as multiple regression, data mining allows
multiple non-linear relationships and interaction effects to be efficiently captured(

2

,

3

). Several data mining tools exist. In the present study we used &#x2018;classifiers&#x2019;.
A classifier is a function that labels individuals on an outcome (e.g. achieving a dietary
recommendation or not) based on a group of predictor variables (e.g. how much of each
individual food was consumed). The analysis package is first provided with a &#x2018;training
set&#x2019; of individual-level data in which both the outcome and the predictor variables are
known, and uses this to learn how the predictor variables are related to the outcome. This
produces the classifier function, which can then be used to infer the outcome in a new
case based on just the predictor variables. Finally, the accuracy of the classifier is
evaluated on a new &#x2018;testing set&#x2019; of data.
        There are numerous ways to build classifiers. We used &#x2018;decision trees&#x2019;(

2

,

,

). Decision trees provide a graphical illustration of a classifier composed of
a number of predictor variables. A decision tree involves repeated &#x2018;cuts&#x2019; of the data
according to the level of included predictor variables to identify groups of individuals
who are similar in terms of the outcome variable of interest. This produces a decision
tree where the path from the root to the outcome corresponds to successive &#x2018;cuts&#x2019;, or
divisions, of the population.

Figure 1 provides a simplified, hypothetical
example of a decision tree where the intention is to identify whether or not individuals
achieve the recommended intake of fruit and vegetables (the outcome) using information on
the consumption of carrots and white bread (the two predictor variables). Figure 1(a) shows the decision tree based on the &#x2018;cuts&#x2019;
represented in Fig. 1(b), the latter being a simple
graphical plot of consumption of both carrots and white bread with all individuals
labelled according to whether or not they achieve the recommended intake of fruit and
vegetables. In terms of meeting fruit and vegetable recommendations there appear to be
five &#x2018;clusters&#x2019; of participants in Fig. 1(b). A
series of &#x2018;cuts&#x2019; can isolate these clusters. The first cut (labelled &#x2018;A&#x2019; in Fig. 1(a) and 1(b)) divides the population according to
consumption of carrots. The next two cuts (labelled &#x2018;B&#x2019; and &#x2018;C&#x2019;) then divide the resulting
two groups according to consumption of white bread. Finally, a fourth cut (labelled &#x2018;D&#x2019;)
divides those with a medium carrot and medium white bread intake according to a more
fine-grained assessment of carrot intake.Fig. 1(colour online) Schematic illustration of a decision tree (a) and how this is
formed through repeated &#x2018;cuts&#x2019; of the data (b)

        To build decision trees with different numbers of predictor variables, the minimum number
of individual cases that can be further divided by a subsequent &#x2018;cut&#x2019; is varied. If a
small group of individuals can be further subdivided, a sizeable tree including many
predictor variables can result. However, if limits are placed on the minimum size of group
that can be further subdivided, a smaller decision tree, including fewer predictor
variables, results. In the current study we made use of this feature to explore the effect
of including more or fewer predictor variables on the accuracy of decision trees.
        A small number of studies have applied data mining techniques to nutritional data. These
have focused primarily on dietary pattern analysis, exploring which dietary components are
predictive of a range of health outcomes(

6

&#x2013;

9

). However, we are not aware of any other uses of data mining to identify which
foods are predictive of achievement, or not, of key dietary recommendations.

        Aim
        Our aim was to use data mining techniques to determine the number of foods that intake
information was required on to accurately predict achievement, or not, of dietary
recommendations for intake of fruit and vegetables, free sugars, sodium, fat and saturated
fat.

      Methods
      We built decision trees for achievement of key dietary recommendations using data from the
first four years of the rolling programme of the UK&#x2019;s national dietary surveillance data
set: the National Diet and Nutrition Survey (NDNS).

        Data source
        The NDNS is an annual cross-sectional survey assessing the diet, nutrient intake and
nutritional status of the general population aged 18 months and upwards living in private
households in the UK(

10

). Since 2008 an annual &#x2018;rolling programme&#x2019; has been in place, allowing data to
be combined over years. We used data from years 1&#x2013;4 of this programme, collected in
2008&#x2013;12.
        The NDNS aims to collect data from a sample of 1000 respondents per year: at least 500
adults (aged 19 years and older) and at least 500 children (aged 1&#xB7;5 to 18 years).
Households across the UK are selected to take part in the NDNS using a multistage
probability design. In each wave, a random sample of primary sampling units is selected
for inclusion. These are small geographical areas that allow more efficient data
collection by enabling it to be geographically focused. Within these primary sampling
units, private addresses are randomly selected for inclusion. If, on visiting, it is found
that more than one household lives at a particular address, one is randomly selected for
inclusion. Within participating households, up to one adult and one child are randomly
selected to take part as &#x2018;respondents&#x2019;. Data collection includes completion of a 4 d
estimated food diary, where participants estimate the weight of foods consumed using food
labels and household measures(

11

).
        NDNS data were obtained from the UK Data Archive, an online resource that makes research
data available to the UK research community.

        Inclusion and exclusion criteria
        NDNS participants were included in the analysis if they completed 3 or 4 d of the
estimated food diary. As recommendations for fruit and vegetable intake apply only to
those aged 11 years or older, children aged less than 11 years were excluded from this
component of the analysis.

        Outcomes of interest: achievement of dietary recommendations
        Information on which foods were consumed, and how much participants estimated was
consumed, was combined with nutritional information to determine mean daily intake of
fruit and vegetables (80 g portions) and sodium (milligrams), as well as mean daily
percentage of energy derived from fat, saturated fat and free sugars, for each individual.
This information was then used to determine whether or not each individual met
international, or UK, recommendations for these variables.
        We used UK recommendations for fruit and vegetable and sodium intakes, as these have been
graded according to age. It is recommended that individuals aged 11 years and older
consume at least five 80 g portions of fruit and vegetables daily. This includes a maximum
of one portion of juice, with additional juice portions not counted. For sodium, current
UK recommendations are that those aged 11 years and older consume no more than 2400 mg/d;
children aged 7&#x2013;10 years, no more than 2000 mg/d; children aged 4&#x2013;6 years, no more than
1200 mg/d; and children aged 1&#x2013;3 years, no more than 800 mg/d(

12

).
        The WHO recommends population food and nutrient intake goals for the avoidance of
diet-related diseases. These state that no more than 30 % of energy should be derived from
fat, no more than 10 % from saturated fat and no more than 10 % from free sugars(

13

).

        Predictor variables of interest: foods consumed
        In total, 3911 different foods (including drinks) have been recorded in NDNS food
diaries. We used total estimated weight (in grams) of each individual food eaten by each
individual as potential predictor variables. Age and sex were also included as potential
predictor variables. The use of including markers of socio-economic position (education,
income and social class) as potential predictor variables was explored, but these were
found to add no additional increase in accuracy over and above age, sex and individual
foods. Decision trees reported here do not include any socio-economic predictor
variables.

        Data analysis
        Our analysis scripts and detailed decision trees are available at https://osf.io/znv82.
In all cases except sodium, the proportion of individuals achieving the recommendations
was substantially less than 50 %; for sodium substantially more than 50 % of individuals
achieved the recommendations (Table 2). As
detailed in the online supplementary material, this imbalance in outcome variables can
lead to low-quality classifiers. To correct this, we pre-processed the data using the
Synthetic Minority Over-sampling TEchnique (SMOTE)(

14

), which creates new cases for the group that accounted for less than 50 % of
participants by interpolating between existing cases that lie together. WEKA
software(

15

) was then used to build decision trees using the J48 algorithm and error
pruning.Table 1Comparison of the analytical sample with the UK populationAdults aged 19 years or olderChildren aged &lt;19 yearsAnalytical sample (n

        For each outcome of interest we built a series of decision trees with different numbers
of predictor variables by varying the minimum number of individual cases that could be
further divided. For each of the decision trees built, we calculated the number of
predictor variables used and overall accuracy in correctly classifying individuals. We
used the standard tenfold cross-validation procedure(

16

) in which the entire eligible NDNS data set was split into ten approximately
equally sized parts. Nine parts were used in turn as training sets and the remaining tenth
part was used as the testing set. The ability of decision trees to correctly identify
those who achieved the recommendations (sensitivity) and those who did not (specificity)
was also calculated. Adaptive sampling was used to identify the maximum overall accuracy
that could be achieved, as well as the optimum trade-off between minimizing the number of
predictor variables and maximizing the overall accuracy.

      Results
      Overall, 91 % of households eligible for inclusion agreed to take part in the first four
waves of NDNS. Within these, 56 % (2083 adults and 2073 children; 4156 participants in
total) of individuals selected to take part completed 3 or 4 d of the estimated food diary
and were included in the analysis for sodium, free sugars, fat and saturated fat. Of these
4156 participants, 2967 (71&#xB7;4 %) were aged 11 years or older and included in the analysis
for fruit and vegetables. There were no missing data on sex or age.
      The distributions of age and sex in the analytical sample compared with the UK population
as a whole are shown in Table 1. As the NDNS sample
contains relatively equal numbers of children aged 18 years or younger and adults,
distributions are provided separately for adults and children in Table 1. The main differences in the age and sex distributions between
the analytical sample and the UK population were that the analytical sample had a higher
proportion of adult women and a lower proportion of young adults (aged 19&#x2013;29 years) than the
UK population.

Figure 2 shows the overall accuracy of decision trees
for each of the five outcomes plotted against the number of predictor variables in decision
trees. Overall accuracy ranged from 69 % (fat; ten predictor variables) to 84 % (fruit and
vegetables; fifty predictor variables) depending on the outcome of interest and number of
predictor variables included. For all guidelines but sodium, the relationship between the
number of predictor variables and the accuracy was best described using a logarithmic trend
model (P&lt;0&#xB7;01 in all cases). Thus, increasing the number of
predictor variables from about ten to thirty improved the accuracy by a maximum of about
five percentage points, but beyond this adding even a large number of additional predictor
variables yielded only a very small additional improvement. We were unable to fit any
function to the relationship between accuracy and number of predictor variables for
sodium.Fig. 2(colour online) Overall accuracy (with 95 % confidence margins) of decision trees
v. the number of predictor variables included, using data mining
techniques on the nutritional intake of 4156 individuals (2967 individuals for fruit
and vegetables) from the UK National Diet and Nutrition Survey (2008&#x2013;12)

Table 2 provides information on the decision tree
for each outcome that represented the best trade-off between accuracy and number of
predictor variables. Information on the most accurate possible tree for each outcome is also
shown in Table 2. Between eleven (for fruit and
vegetables) and thirty-three (for fat) predictor variables provided the best trade-off to
identify whether individuals achieved each of the recommendations, achieving overall
accuracy of 72 % (for fat) to 83 % (for fruit and vegetables). Adding further predictor
variables beyond this improved accuracy by a maximum of 2 % (for saturated fat) and less
than 1 % (for all other outcomes). Sensitivity and specificity were similar to overall
accuracy for fruit and vegetables and free sugars (and for saturated fat when the maximum
number of predictor variables was included). However, specificity was higher than
sensitivity for fat (and saturated fat), but the reverse was seen for sodium. Predictor
variables in decision trees with the best trade-off between accuracy and number of predictor
variables accounted for between 13 % (for fat) and 31 % (for free sugars) of total intake of
relevant outcome variables.Table 2Prevalence of achieving and not achieving dietary recommendations and accuracy of

In total, 113 foods (3 % out of a total 3911 recorded as consumed), age and sex were
included in the decision trees for all five outcomes. Overall, there was little overlap in
predictor variables across outcomes. Age and two foods were included as predictor variables
in the decision trees for three outcomes. A further six foods were included as predictor
variables in the decision trees for two outcomes. The remaining 104 foods were included as
predictor variables in only one decision tree.Table 3Predictor variables (individual foods, age and sex) included in decision trees for

      Discussion

        Summary of results
        The present study represents the first work we are aware of using data mining techniques
to explore the number of foods that information is required on to predict achievement of
dietary recommendations. In total, information on consumption of 113 of 3911 foods (3 %),
plus age and sex was required to accurately categorize individuals according to all five
dietary recommendations (fruit and vegetables, free sugars, sodium, fat and saturated
fat). The best trade-off between decision tree accuracy and number of foods included was
achieved at between eleven (for fruit and vegetables) and thirty-two (for fat, plus age)
foods. These decision trees had an overall accuracy of 72 % (for fat) to 83 % (for fruit
and vegetables), with similar values for sensitivity and specificity. Few individual foods
were present in the decision tree for more than one dietary recommendation, although age
was present in three.

        Strengths and limitations of methods
        We used data from a population-based sample, meaning that our findings are likely to be
generalizable across the UK and to other countries with similar dietary profiles. However,
diets vary internationally(

17

) and our results may not be more widely generalizable. The analytical sample
had a slightly higher proportion of adult women and a lower proportion of younger adults
(aged 19&#x2013;29 years) than the UK population as a whole.
        The data used were collected using &#x2018;estimated&#x2019; food diaries where portion sizes were
estimated but not weighed. These are considered to be one of the more accurate methods of
measuring dietary intake(

18

), meaning that both the predictor and outcome variables are likely to be
valid. However, even estimated food diaries have their limitations, particularly in terms
of participant burden and under-reporting of energy intake(

19

,

20

). Doubly labelled water has been used to estimate total energy expenditure in
a sub-sample of NDNS participants and compared with reported energy intake from food
diaries. This reveals that reported energy intake is 12&#x2013;34 % lower than estimated total
energy expenditure, depending on the age of participants(

11

). This mismatch may be due to intentional or unintentional misreporting;
participants changing their food intake in response to recording it; or a variety of other
reasons. However, misreporting is unlikely to affect all foods and nutrients equally. For
example, participants may be more likely to misreport confectionery than vegetable intake.
For this reason, misreporting is not adjusted for in NDNS and we have not adjusted for
misreporting here.
        Data mining using decision trees is computationally and statistically efficient. For
example, inclusion of all 3911 foods consumed by NDNS participants in regression models
with achievement of dietary recommendations as outcomes would be computationally, and
statistically, demanding and unlikely to produce satisfactory results. Decision trees also
produce transparent, and intuitively understandable, outputs (ours are provided at https://osf.io/znv82)(

21

).
        Many of foods included in the analysis had very skewed distributions. Indeed, the vast
majority of foods in the database (3618) were eaten by less than 150 people. Decision
trees seek to maximize information gain at each step, rather than working with the
distribution as a whole as in traditional regression analysis. If an item is very
discriminatory and helps differentiate between those who do and do not meet a particular
guideline then it will be included, even if it is consumed by only a small number of
people. Conversely, if an item is eaten by almost everyone but is not discriminatory, then
it would be unlikely to be included. There was no overall trend between the proportion of
participants who ate a food and the chance that that food was included in a decision tree
(data not shown).
        We used adaptive sampling to identify decision trees that achieved the best trade-off
between accuracy and number of predictor variables included. Thus, instead of
systematically calculating the accuracy of all decision trees including all possible
number of predictor variables, we focused on identifying the relationship between accuracy
and number of predictor variables (logarithmic in most cases) and where the optimum
trade-off between accuracy and number of predictor variables occurred (i.e. where the
logarithmic curve flattened out). This means we cannot be absolutely sure that we have
identified the decision trees with the best trade-off between accuracy and number of
predictor variables in all cases. However, given the very small additional improvements in
accuracy achieved by the most accurate v. best trade-off decision trees,
we are certainly likely to have identified the near-best trade-off decision trees.
        We used estimated dietary records as our &#x2018;gold standard&#x2019; tool for determining whether or
not individuals achieved recommendations. Further work will be required to compare the
accuracy of our decision trees with other methods of estimating who achieves dietary
recommendations, such as FFQ.

        Interpretation and implications of findings and areas for future work
        Our findings indicate that information on only a small number of foods is required to
determine whether individuals achieve five important dietary recommendations. If such
binary outcomes are the key outcome of interest, then more detailed dietary assessment
methods may inappropriately use scarce research resources and be unnecessarily burdensome
to participants.
        While our results suggest that information on only a limited number of foods needs to be
captured when assessing whether guidelines are met, substantial further research will be
needed before these findings could be applied in the form of a new dietary assessment
instrument. First, it would be helpful to replicate our analyses in a different, but
comparable, sample. We have not done this as we are not aware of a comparable UK
population-representative sample in whom diet diaries have been collected. Our decision
trees used information on exact intake of 113 foods over 3&#x2013;4 d. Assessing exact intake of
a small number of foods may be no less burdensome for participants than assessing
estimated intake of all foods using a food diary. Future work could compare the accuracy
of decision trees based on exact intake of 113 foods, approximate intake of these foods
(e.g. using the ordinal categories often used in FFQ), and exact and approximate intakes
of foods at the food group, rather than individual food, level. Acceptability to research
participants and resource implications of collecting the data required in all cases should
also be compared.
        Our analysis focused on which foods can be used to predict whether or not individuals
achieve dietary recommendations. But it is not necessarily the case that it is the foods
included in the decision tress which cause people to achieve the recommendations or not. A
maximum of only 31 % of the total intake of relevant nutrients or foods was accounted for
by predictor variables in decision trees with the best trade-off between accuracy and
number of predictor variables. Thus, decision trees did not particularly include foods
that account for the majority of intake of nutrients and foods of interest &#x2013; as might be
expected in an FFQ. The complex relationships between individual foods included in our
decision trees and the dietary recommendations they are associated with may offer further
useful insights and could be studied further.

      Conclusion
      We used data mining techniques to explore the number of foods that consumption information
was required on to accurately predict achievement, or not, of five key dietary
recommendations. Information on consumption of eleven to thirty-two foods (plus age and sex)
was sufficient to identify with 72&#x2013;83 % accuracy whether individuals achieved individual
dietary recommendations. In total, information on 113 foods was required to predict
achievement of all five recommendations studied. This method could be used to develop a new
dietary assessment questionnaire.
