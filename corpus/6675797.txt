        The aim of the present work was to study the technological impact of incorporating canola protein concentrate (extract) into gluten-free bread formulation made of white rice flour. The main properties of the obtained dough and bread were compared to two control formulations made of 100% wheat flour and 100% rice flour. The canola protein concentrate was added at 3, 6 and 9% supplementation level of the rice flour. The bread making process was conducted by approved technology and the obtained results showed that addition of canola protein concentrate to rice flour significantly improved the overall quality of the resulted bread even if its mass volume (1.777&#xA0;mL/g) and honeycomb structure were of lower quality compared to those of control bread which was made of 100% wheat flour (2.518&#xA0;mL/g). However, the mass volume of rice bread supplemented with canola protein concentrate was significantly higher than that of bread made of 100% rice flour (1.417&#xA0;mL/g. In summary, this project demonstrated the positive impact of canola proteins incorporation into white rice flour-based gluten-free bread. These results contribute to the progress of current research focusing on substituting gluten by other proteins having good techno-functional properties. Moreover, a mathematical model was used to explain the impact of the added canola protein concentrate on the intensity of the reactions involved in the dough matrix during oven baking. The obtained model clearly highlighted the significant effect of both the baking time and temperature.
