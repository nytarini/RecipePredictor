However, these preclinical discrimination studies have exclusively used food as the reinforcer and the effects of drugs as reinforcers in these operant procedures are unknown. The present study determined effects of contingent intravenous remifentanil injections on DNMTS performance hypothesized to assess one aspect of executive function, working memory. Daily behavioral sessions consisted of two components with sequential intravenous remifentanil (0, 0.01–1.0 μg/kg/injection) or food (0, 1–10 pellets) availability in non-opioid dependent male rhesus monkeys (n=3). Remifentanil functioned as a reinforcer in the DNMTS procedure. Similar delay-dependent DNMTS accuracy was observed under both remifentanil- and food-maintained components, such that higher accuracies were maintained at shorter (0.1–1 s) delays and lower accuracies approaching chance performance were maintained at longer (10–32 s) delays. Remifentanil maintained significantly lower initial DNMTS accuracy compared to food. Reinforcer magnitude was not an important determinant of DNMTS accuracy for either remifentanil or food. These results extend the range of experimental procedures under which drugs function as reinforcers. Furthermore, the selective remifentanil-induced decrease in initial DNMTS accuracy is consistent with a selective impairment of attentional, but not memorial, processes.

   Introduction
Working memory is one domain of executive function that is commonly evaluated in both humans (Chelonis et al., 2014) and nonhumans (Castner, Goldman-Rakic, &amp; Williams, 2004; White, 2013) using discrete-trial discrimination procedures, such as delayed nonmatching-to-sample (DNMTS). In preclinical studies, cocaine or methamphetamine self-administration has been shown to impair performance on DNMTS and related discrimination procedures in both rats and monkeys (George, Mandyam, Wee, &amp; Koob, 2007; Gould, Garg, Garg, &amp; Nader, 2013; Kangas &amp; Bergman, 2016). However, one interpretive complication arising from this literature is that behavior in these discrete-trial discrimination procedures was exclusively reinforced by food. That is, a history of cocaine or methamphetamine self-administration may have altered the effectiveness of the food reinforcer to maintain behavior in the discrimination procedure, resulting in a decrease in performance. In addition, preclinical studies have also reported that noncontingent mu-opioid agonist administration failed to attenuate performance in these discrimination procedures up to doses that disrupted rates of responding (Bain et al., 2003; Hudzik &amp; Wenger, 1993; McMillan, 1981; Picker, Massie, &amp; Dykstra, 1987; Schulze &amp; Paule, 1991). One potential explanation for the absence of opioid-induced impaired performance in these previous studies may be related to the contingency of opioid delivery. Thus, the effects of abused drugs on behavior in these discrimination procedures when the drug is delivered as the consequent stimulus remains unknown.

The present study aim was to determine DNMTS accuracy under conditions where behavior was reinforced with either intravenous remifentanil injections or food pellets in male rhesus monkeys. Remifentanil was chosen as the mu-opioid agonist for the following two reasons. First, remifentanil has previously been shown to be an effective reinforcer in monkeys under other schedules of reinforcement (Maguire, Gerak, &amp; France, 2013; Woods &amp; Winger, 2002). Second, remifentanil has a relatively short duration of action (Glass, Gan, &amp; Howell, 1999; Ko, Terner, Hursh, Woods, &amp; Winger, 2002; Rosow, 1999) that affords the potential to conduct a greater number of discrete trials in the DNMTS procedure. If contingent remifentanil injections impaired memorial processes, then we would hypothesize the slope (β) of the forgetting function relating DNMTS accuracy to delay interval would be lower under remifentanil- vs. food-maintained DNMTS components (White, 2001). If remifentanil injections impaired attentional processes, then we would hypothesize that initial discriminability (y-intercept;α) would be lower under remifentanil- vs. food-maintained DNMTS components. An interrelated, second aim was to determine the role of reinforcer magnitude on remifentanil- and food-maintained DNMTS performance. Although reinforcer magnitude is an important determinant of behavior in more traditional intravenous drug self-administration procedures, less is known about the role of reinforcer magnitude in discrimination procedures. To date, a single pigeon study reported that increasing food reinforcer magnitudes corresponded with a small, but statistically significant, increase in initial discriminability (Brown &amp; White, 2009). If absolute reinforcer magnitude was an important determinant of DNMTS accuracy as reinforcer magnitude is an important determinant of behavior in more traditional drug self-administration procedures, we hypothesized accuracy would increase in a magnitude-dependent manner for both remifentanil- and food-maintained components and that rate-based performance measures would covary with DNMTS accuracy.

Materials and Methods
Animals
Three adult male rhesus monkeys (Macaca mulatta) of Chinese origin and purchased from a commercial vendor served as research subjects. Monkeys were surgically implanted with an indwelling double-lumen catheter (0.76 mm ID × 2.66 mm OD, STI Flow, Morrisville, NC) into a major (femoral or jugular) vein under aseptic conditions and isoflurane (IsoFlo, Zoetis, Madison, NJ) anesthesia. All monkeys were experienced with the DNMTS procedure where food was the maintaining event and experimental drug histories of acute methylphenidate and Δ9–tetrahydrocannabinol administration (Hutsell &amp; Banks, 2015). Monkeys were between 5–8 years old, weighed between 7–10 kg, and were maintained on a diet of fresh fruit and food biscuits (Lab Diet High Protein Monkey Biscuits no. 5045; PMI Nutrition, St. Louis, MO) provided after daily experimental sessions to maintain stable behavioral performance. Water was continuously available in the home cage via an automatic watering system. A 12-h light-dark cycle was in effect (lights on from 0600 to 1800 h). Animal research and maintenance were conducted according to the Guide (8th edition; 2011) for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals. Animal facilities were licensed by the United States Department of Agriculture and accredited by AALAC International. The Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee approved both research and environmental enrichment protocols. Monkeys had visual, auditory, and olfactory contact with other monkeys throughout the entire study. Operant procedures, foraging devices, and videos were provided for additional environmental manipulation and enrichment.

Apparatus
Monkeys were individually housed in well-ventilated, stainless steel chambers that also served as experimental chambers. Each chamber was equipped with a custom-made, stainless steel screen enclosure (Lafayette Instrument, Lafayette, USA), which was mounted on the front wall of the chamber to provide access to a 15″ touch-sensitive screen (33.6×26.4 cm Model 1537L; Elo TouchSystems, Menlo Park, CA). Each chamber was also equipped with a pellet dispenser (Model ENV-203-1000; Med Associates, St Albans, VT) and two syringe pumps (Model PHM-108, Med Associates) mounted on a shelf above the chamber. One pump delivered contingent remifentanil injections through one catheter lumen. The second pump delivered a 0.1 mL noncontingent saline infusion through the second catheter lumen to maintain catheter patency at a programmed rate of every 20 min from 1200 h each day until 1100 h the following morning. The intravenous catheter was protected by a customized stainless steel tether and jacket system (Lomir Biomedical, Malone, NY) that connected to a two-channel fluid swivel (Lomir Biomedical) mounted to the chamber top and permitted monkeys to move freely within the home chamber. Catheter patency was periodically evaluated by intravenous ketamine (1–5 mg/kg) administration through one catheter lumen. The catheter was considered patent if intravenous ketamine administration produced muscle tone loss within 10 s. All experimental events and data were collected using custom programming in ABET II Touch software (Lafayette Instrument) in tandem with a Whisker server (Cambridge University, UK). Touchscreen stimuli were made in Microsoft PowerPoint for Mac 2011 using the hue-saturation-brightness slider (Hutsell &amp; Banks, 2015). Sample and comparison stimuli were shades of gray constructed by adjusting the hue and saturation to 0.0 and varying brightness/intensity. Brightness was set at 1.8% (black) and 100.0% (white) throughout the present study.

Delayed Nonmatching-to-Sample (DNMTS) Procedure
Daily behavioral sessions were conducted 5–7 days per week and consisted of two experimental components comprised of 80 trials each. The remifentanil-maintained component began at 0800 h and following a 60-min intercomponent interval, the food-maintained component began at 1100 h. Remifentanil and food availability were signaled by different colors projected as the touchscreen background, such that a green background was associated with remifentanil availability and a red background was associated with food availability. Each trial, regardless of reinforcer availability, began with a black or white square sample stimulus appearing at the center screen location. Once the sample stimulus was touched ten consecutive times (FR10) within 15 s of trial onset (15-s limited hold), the sample stimulus was removed. Training sessions consisted of a single, 0.1-s delay and testing sessions consisted of four different delay intervals (1, 3.2, 10, or 32 s) presented in quasi-random order. Following a delay, choice stimuli were presented in the left and right locations. A single touch (FR1) of a choice stimulus (5-s limited hold) removed all stimuli from the screen. Under baseline conditions, correct responses (touches to the shade that did not match the sample) resulted in the delivery of 0.1 μg/kg/injection remifentanil or one food pellet (5TUR, 1-g banana-flavored precision primate tablet, Test Diets, Richmond, IL), followed by a 60-s intertrial interval (ITI). The remifentanil training dose was based on an initial remifentanil dose-effect function determined under an FR10, 10-s ITI schedule of reinforcement (data not shown). Incorrect responses (touches to the shade that matched the sample) resulted in a 60-s ITI. Sample stimuli were equally presented during both training and testing sessions and the same sample stimulus could not be presented on more than four consecutive trials. In addition, the location of the correct, nonmatching choice (left or right) was counterbalanced and programmed to occur an equal number of times each session.

Once DNMTS performance during baseline training sessions was stable, defined as the absence of a trend in accuracy and trials completed, the effects of reinforcer magnitude were examined. Specifically, saline and different unit remifentanil doses (0.01, 0.1, or 1.0 μg/kg/injection) or different food pellet numbers (0, 1, 3, or 10) were delivered for each correct (nonmatching) response during 0.1-s delay training sessions. Remifentanil dose was manipulated by changing the concentration in the syringe, and injections were delivered in a constant volume of 0.1 mL over 0.95 s. Each manipulation was in effect for a minimum of 3 sessions and until performance was stable as judged by the absence of trend (Killeen, 1978). Delay test sessions were subsequently conducted with that same reinforcer magnitude for a minimum of 3 sessions and until performance was stable as defined above. Remifentanil and food reinforcer magnitude manipulations were evaluated simultaneously because preliminary experiments suggested that the remifentanil-maintained DNMTS component did not significantly alter accuracy during the food-maintained DNMTS component and visa-versa. Experimental manipulation order was counterbalanced across monkeys. Following a reinforcer magnitude manipulation, baseline (0.1 μg/kg/injection remifentanil or one food pellet) conditions at the 0.1-s delay were implemented for at least 3 days and until behavior was stable before the next reinforcer magnitude manipulation was introduced.

Drugs
Remifentanil HCl was purchased as Ultiva® (GlaxoSmithKline) from the hospital pharmacy and dissolved in 0.9% saline. All remifentanil doses were expressed as the salt form listed above, and all drug solutions were passed through a sterile 0.2-micron filter (EMD Millipore, Billerica, MA) before intravenous administration.

Data analysis
The primary dependent measures were accuracy and proportion of trials completed at each delay interval. DNMTS accuracy was calculated as discriminability (log d) at each delay interval (i.e., a forgetting function). Discriminability, expressed as log d, was derived from a behavioral model of signal detection (Davison &amp; Nevin, 1999; Davison &amp; Tustin, 1978)


 (1) logd=0.5·log(C1E1·C2E2)  where C1 and C2 are correct (nonmatching) responses and E1 and E2 are error (matching) responses following each sample stimulus. Because log d was undefined when one response type was 0, a modified correction procedure was used (Brown &amp; White, 2005). The constant added to each response count was proportional to the number of trials completed at a given delay and, therefore, the maximum log d was set at 2.2.

A model comparison approach was used to determine reinforcer type and magnitude effects on the forgetting function as described previously (Hutsell &amp; Banks, 2015). Specifically, an exponential equation was fit to obtained forgetting functions


 (2) logd=α·e-βt  where the free parameters α and β were the y-intercept and slope of the equation, respectively, and t was the delay interval. Model comparison was implemented by fitting all possible submodels of equation 2. Submodels specify which parameters of equation 2 were affected by reinforcer type or magnitude manipulations. For example, the null submodel used the same α and β parameters to fit the forgetting functions from all reinforcer type and magnitude manipulations (2 model parameters, k = 2) and the full submodel used different α and β parameters for each reinforcer magnitude manipulation (2 model parameters × 6 reinforcer magnitudes, k = 12). The most parsimonious submodel was determined by calculating Akaike Information Criterion (AICc) and the submodel with the highest Akaike weight (wi) was selected (Anderson, Burnham, &amp; Thompson, 2000; Franklin, Shenk, Anderson, &amp; Burnham, 2001). The AICc was selected over the Bayesian information criterion because the former is considered asymptotically optimal when using a least-squares loss function (Burnham &amp; Anderson, 2002; Yang, 2005). The resulting individual and group y-intercept (α) and slope (β) parameters were determined for both remifentanil- and food-maintained components. Group mean parameters were considered significantly different if the 95% confidence limits did not overlap. Proportion of trials completed and rates of responding during the sample and choice phases of the DNMTS procedure were analyzed using two-way repeated-measures (RM) ANOVA with reinforcer magnitude and type as the main factors. A significant ANOVA was followed by the Dunnet post-hoc test. The criterion for statistical significance was set a priori at the 95% confidence level (P&lt;0.05).

Results
DNMTS Accuracy
Figure 1 shows group mean discriminability (log d) plotted as a function of delay interval duration during remifentanil- (Panels A) and food-maintained (Panels B) components. For both reinforcers, discriminability was maximal at short (0.1–1 s) delay intervals and decreased to near chance levels at longer (10–32 s) delay intervals. The most parsimonious model indicated there was an effect of reinforcer type (remifentanil vs. food) on initial (α) DNMTS accuracy, but not on the slope (β) of the forgetting function (Supplemental Table 1). Specifically, initial DNMTS accuracy was (AICc = −183.6) smaller for remifentanil-maintained DNMTS compared to food-maintained DNMTS. Using this model, Table 1 shows individual and group mean α and β parameters for both remifentanil- and food-maintained DNMTS. Initial DNMTS accuracy was significantly lower during remifentanil vs. food-maintained components as demonstrated by non-overlapping confidence limits. In contrast, the slope parameters were not significantly different between remifentanil- and food-maintained DNMTS and thus were shared in the model. Delay test sessions were not conducted for the saline substitution and 0-pellet conditions because of extinguished responding that resulted in &lt; 15% of the total proportion of trials completed under baseline conditions.

Trial Completion and Response Rates
Figure 1 also shows group mean proportion of trials completed plotted as a function of delay interval duration during remifentanil (Panels C) and food (Panels D) components. Because behavior extinguished during delay test sessions under both saline substitution and 0 pellet conditions, only the proportion of trials completed at the 0.1-s delay were subjected to statistical analysis (reinforcer magnitude: F(3,6)=39.8, P=0.0002, partial η2=0.84; reinforcer type F(1,2)=86.7, P=0.00113, partial η2=0.63; interaction F(3,6)=6.8, P=0.0237, partial η2=0.77). For remifentanil, the proportion of trials completed displayed a prototypic inverted U-shaped dose-effect function with a 0.1 μg/kg/injection remifentanil maintaining the greatest proportion of completed trials compared to saline substitution (P&lt;0.05). For food, the proportion of completed trials decreased as the number of food pellets increased and 1-pellet delivery maintained the greatest proportion of trials completed compared to the 0-pellet condition (P&lt;0.05). To elucidate whether reinforcer type and magnitude effects on trial completion were the result of failure to initiate a trial or trial incompletion, sample and choice rates of responding during the 0.1-s training delay sessions were also calculated. Sample rates of responding (data not shown) were significantly (P&lt;0.05) lower under remifentanil-maintained components compared to food-maintained components (reinforcer type: F(1,2)=20.6, P=0.045, partial η2=0.85; interaction: F(2,4)=26.6, P=0.005, partial η2=0.42). There was also a main effect of reinforcer magnitude (F(2,4)=7.05, P=0.049, partial η2=0.08) and reinforcer type (F(1,2)=27.68, P=0.034, partial η2=0.18), but no interaction on choice rates of responding (data not shown). However, neither main effect survived multiple comparison corrections.

Discussion
The present study aim was to determine the effect of intravenous remifentanil as the reinforcer in a delayed nonmatching-to-sample (DNMTS) discrimination procedure hypothesized to assess working memory. There were three main findings. First, remifentanil functioned as a reinforcer under the DNMTS procedure. These results extend the range of experimental conditions under which drugs function as reinforcers to the general category of discrimination procedures that assess domains of executive function (Robbins, 1998). Second, both remifentanil and food maintained delay-dependent DNMTS accuracy that was generally independent of reinforcer magnitude. The slope of the forgetting function under remifentanil and food-maintained conditions was similar suggesting that remifentanil did not alter DNMTS accuracy in a manner that was delay dependent. Lastly, initial discriminability (y-intercept;α) for remifentanil-maintained DNMTS was significantly lower than food-maintained DNMTS. Overall, these results are interpreted to suggest that remifentanil selectively impaired DNMTS performance in a delay-independent manner, consistent with a selective impairment of attentional, but not memorial, processes.

Remifentanil effects on the slope of the forgetting function
The rate of forgetting (slope parameter; β) was not significantly different between remifentanil and food, suggesting that contingent remifentanil delivery did not produce effects consistent with impairment of working memory processes (White, 1985, 2001) assessed under the DNMTS procedure. Only one human study (Fishbein et al., 2007) has used a similar procedure (DMTS) to examine working memory accuracy in opioid abusers. In that study, detoxified heroin abusers displayed a small, but significant, decrease in accuracy during both simultaneous and delayed MTS conditions compared to controls. Collapsing results across all delays and reinforcer magnitudes in the present study resulted in a small, but significant (t=6.4, P=0.0235), decrease in percent correct between the remifentanil- vs. food-maintained components (76.2% vs. 82.3%). However, one problem with collapsing results across the different delays is that the results may be confounded by differences in initial discriminability (y-intercept), such as those reported in the Fishbein (2007) study. Lastly, none of the monkeys in the present study were opioid-dependent at any point during the study and thus the impact of opioid dependence and withdrawal on opioid- and food-maintained DNMTS accuracy during different delays remains to be empirically determined.

Remifentanil effects on initial discriminability
Initial discriminability refers to the y-intercept of the forgetting function and is hypothesized to measure attentional demand or procedural difficulty due to the minimal (i.e., 0.1-s delay) memorial requirement (White, 1985, 2001). In the present study, intravenous remifentanil maintained significantly lower initial discriminability compared to food regardless of reinforcer magnitude. Furthermore, neither a history of remifentanil self-administration before or during food-maintained DNMTS significantly altered initial accuracy maintained by a nondrug reinforcer. Thus, the present results suggest intravenous remifentanil as the reinforcer in the DNMTS procedure produced effects consistent with a selective impairment of attentional demand. This interpretation is consistent with previous clinical results in early opioid-abstinent humans (Mintzer, Copersino, &amp; Stitzer, 2005; Rapeli et al., 2006) and consistent with results from recent meta-analyses of past and current illicit opioid abusers (Baldacchino, Balfour, Passetti, Humphris, &amp; Matthews, 2012; Biernacki, McLennan, Terrett, Labuschagne, &amp; Rendell, 2016). Furthermore, acute heroin administration in opioid-dependent patients also reduced thalamocortical functional connectivity and correlated with decreased scores on an attentional component of the Barratt Impulsiveness Scale (Denier et al., 2015). Moreover, intravenous drug delivery has been more difficult to establish Pavlovian conditioned responding hypothesized to rely on attentional processes compared to food (Kearns &amp; Weiss, 2004). Overall, the present results are consistent with the hypothesis that opioid exposure can impair performance on behavioral tasks assessing attentional processes.

Initial discriminability could have also been lower under remifentanil- vs. food-maintained components for reasons unrelated to attentional processes. Two will be mentioned. First, remifentanil could have been a less effective reinforcer compared to food due to the time lag of intravenous remifentanil delivery compared to taste receptor activation of the food pellet. This explanation seems unlikely because previous studies in nonhuman primates using a delay-discounting procedure have consistently shown that delayed reinforcer delivery attenuates both food- (Huskinson et al. 2015) and remifentanil-maintained responding (Maguire et al. 2013; Maguire et al. 2016). Furthermore, median rates of discounting (k values) are relatively similar between intravenous drug (Maguire et al. 2016; Woolverton et al. 2007) and food (Huskinson et al. 2015) reinforcers and suggest that delay to reinforcer delivery impacts the reinforcing effectiveness of food and intravenous drug reinforcers similarly. Second, initial discriminability could have been lower under remifentanil-maintained components because of remifentanil reinforcement-independent rate-altering effects. Comparison of remifentanil effects with food pellet magnitude manipulations does not support a rate-altering interpretation. Specifically, under the 10-pellet condition measures of choice frequency and response times were decreased to levels near those maintained by remifentanil, yet discriminability was not altered. Therefore, the reinforcement-independent rate-altering effects of food were present in the absence of effects on discriminability and suggest that rate-based measures of behavior were independent of behavior allocation measures of discriminability in this study.

Reinforcer magnitude effects on DNMTS accuracy
Manipulating either remifentanil or food reinforcer magnitude did not significantly alter either initial discriminability or the rate of forgetting in the present study. The absence of a reinforcer magnitude effect on the rate of forgetting was consistent with a previous study manipulating food magnitude under a DMTS procedure in pigeons (Brown &amp; White, 2009). However, the absence of a magnitude effect on initial discriminability was inconsistent with this study. Reasons for these differential results on initial discriminability may be related to differences between species, procedures, or reinforcer type. However, the present results are consistent with delay-discounting experiments suggesting that absolute magnitude of the delayed reinforcer does not significantly alter the rate of discounting in monkeys (Freeman, Green, Myerson, &amp; Woolverton, 2009; Huskinson et al., 2016; Maguire, Gerak, &amp; France, 2016). In contrast, reinforcer magnitude manipulations consistently altered the proportion of trials completed for both remifentanil- and food-maintained components. Proportion of trials completed displayed the prototypic inverted U-shaped dose-effect function classically observed under fixed-ratio schedules of reinforcement in drug self-administration procedures. Proportion of trials completed decreased in a monotonic manner as a function of increased pellet delivery. The quantal delivery of food pellets may have precluded our ability to observe a food magnitude effect and other systems of food delivery (e.g. liquid) may allow for more graded magnitude manipulations. Overall, the present results are consistent with the extant literature demonstrating that discrimination procedures provide distinct dependent measures of behavior allocation and rate.

Public Significance Statement
The present results extend the range of experimental conditions under which drugs function as reinforcers to operant procedures designed to assess components of working memory. The present results also suggest that reinforcing behavior with intravenous opioids in a DNMTS ‘working memory’ procedure may selectively impair attentional, but not memorial, processes.
