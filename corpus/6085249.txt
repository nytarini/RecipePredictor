        The present study reports the outcomes of assessment on acrylamide levels in selected heat-treated foods of diverse brands and origins from Saudi Arabia. In chips, acrylamide level was detected from 28 to 954&#xA0;&#xB5;g/kg, sample 7 (salted) contained higher amount (954&#xA0;&#x3BC;g/kg) whereas, sample 8 (labneh and mint) comparatively produced lower amount (28&#xA0;&#x3BC;g/kg). Nuts and dried fruits have generated acrylamide from 2 to 93&#xA0;&#xB5;g/kg, salted peanut of Indian origin produced higher amount (93&#xA0;&#x3BC;g/kg) while apricot (plain) relatively generated lower amount (2&#xA0;&#x3BC;g/kg). The levels of acrylamide in biscuits, pastry, cacao, chocolate, olive, cheese, corn, oat and wheat flakes, and bread were found from 26 to 234&#xA0;&#xB5;g/kg. Biscuits generated high concentration (234&#xA0;&#x3BC;g/kg) while corn flakes fairly generated lower amount (26&#xA0;&#x3BC;g/kg). The obtained results have shown a great variation of acrylamide content and reason might be due to foods type, cooking ingredients and, cooking methods, time and temperature.
