        Restructured surimi gel product was prepared using short nosed white tripod (Triacanthus brevirosterus) with egg white as additive at 1&#xA0;%. Heat setting was done initially at 45&#xA0;&#xB0;C for 30&#xA0;min followed by heat processing 90&#xA0;&#xB0;C for 45&#xA0;min. Restructured surimi gel in stew was standardized using four most popular recipes available in local cuisine based on the sensory acceptance and the Kerala fish stew was considered best. Restructured surimi gel in Kerala fish stew was then heat processed in 4 ply laminated retort pouch of dimension 150&#xD7; 200&#xA0;mm, at 15&#xA0;psi gauge pressure for varying time duration and the Fo values ranged from 13.10 to 22.58&#xA0;min. Products examined of their organoleptic and microbial qualities showed those processed with Fo value of 13.10&#xA0;min was acceptable with excellent eating quality with no fishy flavour and was microbial sterile until the storage period of 6&#xA0;months.
