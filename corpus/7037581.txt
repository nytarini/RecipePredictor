inging essential nutrients such as proteins, fat, sugars, minerals, and micro-nutrients, it is also the vector of bioactive molecules that will ensure the neonate&#x2019;s development and growth whereas its immune system and defense capacities are, for most mammalian species, still immature at birth. There is indeed substantial evidence that milk contains many bioactive and health-promoting compounds affecting physiological functions or reducing disease risk. This statement is true for the main milk components, particularly for milk proteins (Korhonen and Pihlanto, 2007, Meisel, 2004). Numerous substantiated or potential bioactive protein components have been found, either as intact proteins or as derived peptides, encrypted in the protein sequences (Mohanty, Mohapatra, Misra, &amp; Sahu, 2016). This is particularly true for the caseins that have long been claimed to be devoid of biological functions and designed only to ensure amino acid supply as well as phosphate and calcium absorption.
      Milk is first consumed by neonates, however it is also widely consumed by all categories of consumers as such or after processing as milk-derived products, such as cheeses, fermented milk, etc. Here again, the caseins play a major role, since they are involved in the technological properties of milk, particularly in the milk-clotting process, a crucial step in cheese-making. The protein composition of individual milk samples with impaired coagulation or non-coagulation ability has been increasingly studied (Frederiksen et al., 2011, Ikonen et al., 1999, Joudu et al., 2007, Wedholm et al., 2006). However, the origin of this phenomenon is not yet fully understood, even though it seems that poorly- and non-coagulating milks contain a lower proportion of the 2 less-phosphorylated isoforms of &#x3B1;s-CN (&#x3B1;s1-CN 8P and &#x3B1;s2-CN 11P) and a lower proportion of glycosylated &#x3BA;-CN (Jensen, Holland, Poulsen, &amp; Larsen, 2012). The ability to quantify the casein content represents an issue of crucial importance for the dairy industry. Indeed, the natural variations in milk protein composition and concentration can markedly affect the yield of the cheese making process (Amalfitano et al., 2019; Wedholm et al., 2006), thus causing a direct and significant economic impact on the dairy industry.
      Caseins, which represent more or less 80% of ruminant milk proteins, are essentially concentrated in the colloidal fraction of milk, in the form of highly hydrated and mineralized spherical particles: the so-called casein micelles. In cattle, caseins comprise a group of four peptide chains (&#x3B1;s1-, &#x3B2;-, &#x3B1;s2- and &#x3BA;-CN) resulting from the expression of four tightly linked structural genes (CSN1S1, CSN2, CSN1S2 and CSN3, respectively), of which the first three are evolutionary related (Rijnkels, 2002). Whereas the genomic organization of this locus is highly conserved across mammals, CSN genes have evolved rapidly to give rise to divergent proteins across mammalian species. The protein fraction of cow's milk is mainly composed (between 90 and 95%) of six major milk-specific proteins: four caseins (&#x3B1;s1, &#x3B1;s2, &#x3B2; and &#x3BA;-CN) and two whey proteins: &#x3B1;-lactalbumin (&#x3B1;-LA) and &#x3B2;-lactoglobulin (&#x3B2;-LG), synthesized by the mammary epithelial cell.
      The caseins (CN) are highly polymorphic in cattle and even more so in small ruminants. This feature is first due to the existence of numerous genetic variants (Martin, Bianchi, Cebo, &amp; Miranda, 2013). In addition, the CN exhibit a high degree of heterogeneity due to post-translational modifications (PTM), mainly glycosylation (&#x3BA;-CN) and phosphorylation (&#x3B1;s-, &#x3B2;- and &#x3BA;-CN), which are critical for the formation and stability of CN micelles (Holland &amp; Boland, 2014). Another feature, mainly regarding &#x3B1;s-CN, is the occurrence of splicing variants, arising from the usage of cryptic splice sites and from exon skipping (Martin, Cebo, &amp; Miranda, 2013). These polymorphisms, and particularly those impacting the primary structure of the peptide chain, are not without consequences on the activity of peptides produced after digestion of caseins by proteases in the digestive tract of the consumer, whether adult or newborn. The presence of a wide range of bioactive peptides has been recently shown in the jejunal effluents of humans fed with milk proteins (Boutrou et al., 2013). It is therefore critical to be able to accurately establish the fine composition of the protein fraction of milks.
      Methods conventionally used to profile milk proteins have long been based on gel electrophoresis techniques and liquid chromatography. Even though the Reverse Phase-High Performance Liquid Chromatography (RP-HPLC) proposed by Bobe, Beitz, Freeman, and Lindberg (1998) made it possible to separate and quantify (peak area from absorbance recorded at 214&#xA0;nm) simultaneously the six major bovine milk proteins and some of their genetic variants, it did not provide any information on PTM, in particular on the phosphorylation level of CNs. Later Bordin, Cordeiro Raposo, De La Calle, and Rodriguez (2001) and more recently, Bonfatti, Grigoletto, Cecchinato, Gallo, and Carnier (2008), improved this method, using C4 or C5 columns instead of C18. Capillary Zone Electrophoresis (CZE) was also used for estimating the relative concentration of the individual main milk proteins (Heck et al., 2008). It was claimed that this method discriminates &#x3B1;s-CN differing in the phosphorylation states. However, some peaks are not resolved enough in CZE, making quantification difficult, and some genetic variants cannot be distinguished. This is the case for variants B and C of &#x3B1;s1-CN and variants E and A of &#x3BA;-CN. Moreover, CZE separates &#x3BA;-CN into multiple minor and one major peak (Miralles et al., 2001, Ortega et al., 2003), and minor peaks that represent different glycosylated or phosphorylated isoforms, co-migrate with &#x3B2;-CN A1 and A2 (Otte, Zakora, Kristiansen, &amp; Qvist, 1997). In addition, identifying splicing variants that may represent in some species significant proportions of the cognate proteins is just impossible. Therefore, we have considered introducing mass spectrometry (MS) of which the ability to precisely identify and characterize proteins in complex mixtures has been demonstrated (L&#xE9;onil et al., 1995, Mamone et al., 2003, Miralles et al., 2003), by coupling it with liquid chromatography (LC), thus providing a kind of second dimension of separation. However, although recent advances in the use of MS, in conjunction with protein/DNA sequence database search algorithms allow for identification, it has remained difficult to obtain accurate quantitative information despite recent efforts made to develop quantification methods based on the analysis of intact proteins using Extracted Ion Chromatograms (Vincent, Elkins, Condina, Ezernieks, &amp; Rochfort, 2016).
      The method that we describe here relies upon an LC-MS approach targeting native intact proteins. It provides a detailed and precise determination (qualitative and quantitative) of the six main bovine milk proteins including genetic and splicing variants, as well as isoforms resulting from PTM (phosphorylation, glycosylation). In addition, most of their main degradation products, in particular those resulting from proteolysis by plasmin, the endogenous milk protease, i.e. &#x3B3;-caseins and their complements, can also be determined. In order to allow an automated identification of the six major milk proteins and their different isoforms as well as hydrolysis products, a library of theoretical masses was compiled for the bovine species. The method was validated by testing its linearity, reproducibility, repeatability, and accuracy. Since there is a growing interest for dairy species other than cattle, and even for model species such as humans and rodents, the method, first conceived and developed for bovine milk, is transferable to most mammalian species, including small ruminants, camels, equines, mice, and rabbits, for which specific milk protein mass databases have been created and implemented.

      Materials and methods

        2.1
        Milk samples: collection and preparation
        The milk samples were collected from cows of three different breeds: French Holstein-Friesian (FHF), Normande and Montb&#xE9;liarde, either from INRAE experimental farms (Le Pin-au-Haras) or from herds of dairy producers in the Franche-Comt&#xE9; region (Montb&#xE9;liarde breed). An optimal protocol of sample preparation was implemented to generate consistent and reliable data, minimizing the impact of various factors that influence data quality. Milk samples, preserved with bronopol and placed on ice immediately after milking, were rapidly skimmed by centrifugation at 2,500g and 4&#xA0;&#xB0;C for 20&#xA0;min. The cream was removed by means of a spatula and the skimmed milk was aliquoted into fractions of 20 and 100&#xA0;&#xB5;L, frozen at &#x2212;20&#xA0;&#xB0;C and kept under these conditions until analysis by Liquid Chromatography-Electro Spray Ionization-Mass Spectrometry (LC-ESI-MS).

        2.2
        Reverse-phase high performance liquid chromatography (RP-HPLC)
        RP-HPLC was performed with an Ultimate LC 3000 system (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA) equipped with an auto sampler maintained at 15&#xA0;&#xB0;C and a dual wavelength detector (214 and 280&#xA0;nm). The elution conditions were optimized to ensure the best separation of the six major bovine milk proteins and their main isoforms (genetic variants and PTM isoforms). Skim milk samples (20&#xA0;&#xB5;L) were clarified, at room temperature, by adding 180&#xA0;&#x3BC;L of a clarification solution: 0.1&#xA0;M Bis-Tris buffer (pH 8.0), 8&#xA0;M urea, 4.4&#xA0;mM trisodium citrate, and 19.5&#xA0;mM DTT (Miranda, Mah&#xE9;, Leroux, &amp; Martin, 2004) to dissociate CN micelles. Clarified milk samples (20&#xA0;&#x3BC;L) were injected directly into a Discovery BIO Wide Pore column C5 (150&#xA0;&#xD7;&#xA0;2.10&#xA0;mm, 300&#xA0;&#xC5;), followed by a wash of the injection needle with an (acetonitrile/water, 50/50, v/v) solution. The chromatographic conditions including the different steps of the elution gradient are given in Supplementary material (S0).

        2.3
        MS-parameters
        The RP-HPLC output was directly interfaced with an ESI-TOF mass spectrometer micrOTOF II focus (Bruker Daltonics, Wissembourg, France). The positive ion mode was used and mass scans were acquired over a range of 50 to 3,000&#xA0;m/z. End plate offset voltage was set at &#x2212;500&#xA0;V and capillary voltage to 4,500&#xA0;V. Nebulizer gas (N2) pressure was maintained at 250&#xA0;kPa and drying gas (N2) flow was set at 8.0&#xA0;L/min at 200&#xA0;&#xB0;C. The LC-ESI-MS system was controlled by Hystar software v.2.3 (Bruker Daltonics). The charge number of multi-charged ions, the deconvoluted mass spectra, and the determination of average molecular masses (Mr) were obtained from Data Analysis v.3.4 software (Bruker Daltonics).

        2.4
        Identification of milk proteins
        Identification of the major milk protein isoforms was achieved, thanks to the high mass accuracy of the TOF system, by comparing observed masses after deconvolution of the multi-charged ions spectrum, with theoretical masses of these proteins and their derivatives. In order to enable an automatic identification via the analysis software (Data analysis) we built a library of theoretical masses from literature data and genomic (NCBI) and protein (UniProtKB) sequence databases. In this database (Miranda, Bianchi, &amp; Martin, manuscript in preparation) nearly 3000 theoretical masses corresponding to the multiple isoforms: genetic and splicing variants, PTM status and main known plasmin hydrolysis products of the six major bovine milk-specific proteins (i.e. &#x3B1;s1-, &#x3B1;s2-, &#x3B2;- and &#x3BA;-CN, &#x3B1;-LA and &#x3B2;-LG)) are indexed.

        2.5
        Relative quantification of bovine milk proteins and isoforms

          2.5.1
          Quantification from absorbance at 214&#xA0;nm
          This approach is based on the integration of peak area (absorbance at 214&#xA0;nm) to evaluate the proportions of each of the six milk-specific protein families, relative to the total integrated area of each chromatographic profile of individual milk samples. Corrective factors were introduced for each protein family to take into account specific absorbance at 280&#xA0;nm due to their content in aromatic amino acids. In addition, milk proteolysis and particularly the proteolysis of &#x3B1;s1- and &#x3B2;-CN can be taken into account by quantifying specific degradation products, making it possible to estimate more precisely the relative proportions of each casein, after their reassignment. &#x3B1;s2-CN and &#x3B2;-CN have been reported to carry over from one injection to the following one on C18 columns (Nieuwenhuijse et al., 1991, Visser et al., 1991). Although the column used here was a C5 (less hydrophobic than C18), we searched for a possible memory effect of the column. A milk sample consisting of the 50/50 blend of 2 individual FHF milks (cows #55 and #56) was injected onto the column using the optimized elution gradient followed by a regeneration step (10&#xA0;min to 95% acetonitrile) and an equilibrating step under the initial conditions (10&#xA0;min to 29.5% acetonitrile). Two successive blanks (clarification solution) were then performed under the elution conditions used to analyze the mix of the two milks. This sequence was reproduced three times.

          2.5.2
          Quantification using the intensity of the mass signal (IMS)
          This method is based on the use of the IMS after deconvolution of the multi-charged ions spectrum, taking into account the ability of the different molecules to ionize. Therefore, the various factors expected to impact the ability to ionize (PTM (glycosylation, phosphorylation) and genetic variants) were evaluated.
          To evaluate the effect of phosphorylation levels of proteins on ionization ability, we compared the IMS of a native casein (phosphorylated) to that obtained with the same totally dephosphorylated protein after treatment with the Calf Intestinal alkaline Phosphatase (CIP, SIGMA P6774; 50 units/&#xB5;L). The conditions used to dephosphorylate CN are described in Supplementary material (S0).
          Regarding the possible effect of genetic polymorphisms on ionization ability, the ratio Absorbance at 214&#xA0;nm/Intensity of the deconvoluted Mass Signal (UV/IMS) was determined for the most frequent genetic variants of the same protein. The FHF milk samples analyzed (n&#xA0;=&#xA0;39, in duplicate) came from animals chosen for their representativeness (most frequent genetic variants in the populations analyzed): i.e. &#x3B2;-CN A1, A2, A3, I and B, &#x3B1;s1-CN B and C, &#x3BA;-CN A, E and B and variants A and B for &#x3B2;-LG. Since &#x3B1;s2-CN and &#x3B1;-LA are essentially monomorphic, they were not considered.

        2.6
        Qualification of the LC&#x2013;MS method
        Qualification (performance characteristics) of the LC-MS method was carried out, based on the current normative standards in this field, using FHF milks. The following criteria were studied: quantitative linearity (2 individual milks), intra-laboratory precision (repeatability and reproducibility, with 43 and 10 individual milks, respectively) and accuracy (1 milk spiked with 3 purified proteins).

          2.6.1
          Quantitative linearity
          Quantitative linearity was estimated for the six major bovine milk proteins, using a range of milks with 11 levels of protein concentration, produced by mixing an ultrafiltration retentate (87.54&#xA0;g/L) and a permeate applying a volume/volume dilution principle, by corrected density weighing (to obtain linear dilution coefficients). Each sample was analyzed by the LC-MS method in duplicate. For each sample, the theoretical total protein content was calculated, and a theoretical milk protein level was calculated for each protein (&#x3BA;-CN, &#x3B1;s1-CN, &#x3B1;s2-CN, &#x3B2;-CN, &#x3B1;-LA and &#x3B2;-LG) by applying an average composition factor observed in a previous study (respective average % of the different milk proteins).

          2.6.2
          Intra-laboratory precision
          Intra-laboratory precision was determined by evaluating the repeatability on 43 individual FHF cow&#x2019;s milk samples (duplicate analyses of two independent preparations for each sample) and intra-laboratory reproducibility through the analysis of 10 duplicate samples over 5&#xA0;days (for a total of 200 measurements). The following parameters were calculated both in relative percent of total protein (%) for each milk protein and in g milk protein per liter of milk (g/L): Sr (standard deviation of repeatability) and SR (standard deviation of reproducibility) within the laboratory and r (maximum deviation between replicates) and R (maximum reproducibility deviation).

          2.6.3
          Determination of the accuracy
          The accuracy of the method was determined by supplementation (spiking), at six different levels (0 to 75&#xA0;&#xB5;L, by increment of 15&#xA0;&#xB5;L), of a reference milk with preparations of three proteins (&#x3B1;s1-CN B-8P and 9P, &#x3B2;-CN A2-5P and &#x3B1;-LA) purified in our laboratory. Solutions of purified proteins for spiking were prepared by dissolving lyophilized proteins in water at the following concentrations: 0.725, 0.118 and 0.157&#xA0;&#xB5;g/&#xB5;L, respectively, and their purity estimated in RP-HPLC at 90, 95 and 95%, respectively. Five replicates of six spiked milks, corresponding to six levels of supplementation, were analyzed, i.e. 30 measurements.
          To convert relative into absolute quantification we used the Amido Black method, which is a colorimetric chemical method to quantify true protein content in milk. This method, standardized by AFNOR under the identification NF V 04 216, gives equivalent results to the Kjeldahl method (TN &#x2013; NPN)&#xA0;&#xD7;&#xA0;6.38.

        Qualitative determination of milk proteins

          3.1.1
          Separation and identification of the main milk proteins and related genetic variants
          The RP-HPLC that we developed and we report here is based on previously published works (Bobe et al., 1998, Jaubert and Martin, 1992, Miranda et al., 2004, Visser et al., 1991). A preliminary version of the method was first discussed (Miranda, Krupova, Bianchi, &amp; Martin, 2013) and since then optimized to reach a high resolution level, allowing the discrimination of most of the genetic variants, PTM isoforms, as well as splicing variants and several proteolysis products, including &#x3B3;-CN and their complements.
          The identification, based on a comparison of the masses observed with theoretical molecular masses, deduced from amino acid sequence of proteins and known PTM, was validated by the analysis of milk standards from cows of known genotypes. Fig. 1A shows the elution profile of the major bovine milk proteins yielded from the pool of two individual skimmed milk samples used as standards: cow#55 and cow#56 whose genotypes were AA-AA-BC-A2A3-BB-AB and EB-AA-BB-BA1-BB-AB, respectively at the CSN3, CSN1S2, CSN1S1, CSN2, LALBA and PAEP/BLG loci. Such a sample shows the resolving power of the Biodiscovery C5 column, in the optimized chromatographic conditions used. The chromatographic profile was split into 30 peaks. A perfect resolution of four out of the five most frequent &#x3B2;-CN variants (A1, A2, A3, B and I) found in the populations studied, was thus achieved. &#x3B2;-CN variant I which is rather frequent in several populations, including the Italian (Jann et al., 2004) and Dutch (Visker et al., 2011) HF, Italian Simmental (Bonfatti et al., 2008), as well as the French Montb&#xE9;liarde (Fang et al., 2016), co-eluted with variant A2. Its frequency can reach up to 20% in Dutch HF (Visker et al., 2011). To distinguish variant I from variant A2 it is therefore necessary to use mass data observed under the relevant compound. The difference in mass between the two variants is such (23,983.18&#xA0;Da vs. 23,965.15&#xA0;Da, for &#x3B2;-CN A2-5P and &#x3B2;-CN I-5P, respectively) that, after deconvolution of the multi-charged ions spectrum corresponding to the relevant peak, it becomes easy to determine which variant(s) we are dealing with (Fig. 3).Fig. 1Profiling of the six major milk protein families of cow&#x2019;s milk: identification by mass spectrometry and quantification from absorbance at 214&#xA0;nm. Separation (A), identification and UV quantification (B) of bovine milk proteins including genetic variants and phosphorylation isoforms by RP-HPLC coupled with a microTOF Mass Spectrometer (Bruker Daltonics) from a pool of two reference milk samples (cows #55 and #56) of known genotypes: AA-AA-BC-A2A3-BB-AB and EB-AA-BB-BA1-BB-AB, respectively at the CSN3, CSN1S2, CSN1S1, CSN2, LALBA and PAEP/BLG loci. Identification (B) was confirmed from observed masses by comparison to theoretical masses of the known genetic variants. Relative quantification (B) was determined as relative area (%). Relative areas corresponding to non-identified masses (n.a.) are gathered as &#x201C;others&#x201D;. Proteins of the same family were grouped together by adopting the following specific colour code: &#x3BA;-CN in orange, darker orange for glycosylated &#x3BA;-CN (peak 1); &#x3B1;s2-CN in grey; &#x3B2;-CN and derived molecules &#x3B3;3 and PP5 in blue; &#x3B1;s1-CN in green, &#x3B1;-LA in pink and &#x3B2;-LG in yellow. (For interpretation of the references to colour in this figure legend, the reader is referred to the web version of this article.)
          As far as &#x3BA;-CN is concerned, it is necessary to underline that the major glycosylated isoforms of &#x3BA;-CN are the very first proteins eluted as a single peak, regardless the variant. By contrast, non-glycosylated A and B variants are easily distinguished (Fig. 1A). However, it is again necessary to use mass information (Fig. 1B) to discriminate between non-glycosylated &#x3BA;-CN A (19,037.37&#xA0;Da) and E (19,007.34&#xA0;Da) which are co-eluted in peak 2.
          Likewise, the identification of &#x3B1;s1-CN variants B and C, which are co-eluted (Fig. 1A, peak 19) arises from the masses observed: 23,614.8144 and 23,542.3689 Daltons, respectively (Fig. 1B) compared with the theoretical values of 23,614.712 and 23,542.648, for their major isoform, with eight phosphate residues. It is worth noting that this is virtually the only way to distinguish, in such conditions, the &#x3B1;s1-CN B and C variants that differ only by the E192G mutation. Indeed, to our knowledge, there is no RP-HPLC method so far published resolving these two &#x3B1;s1-CN genetic variants (Bobe et al., 1998, Groen et al., 1994, Nieuwenhuijse et al., 1991, Visser et al., 1991). By contrast, Recio, P&#xE9;rez-Rodr&#xED;guez, Ramos, and Amigo (1997) claim that &#x3B1;s1-CN variants B and C are easily identified, at the heterozygous phenotype in CZE. The accuracy (difference between the observed mass and the theoretical mass) was between 2 and 15&#xA0;ppm (&#xB1;0.02 and 0.35 Dalton on average) for the main isoforms (mass signal intensity &gt;5000).
          The most two frequent genetic variants (A and B) of &#x3B2;-LG are eluted at the end of the chromatogram (Fig. 1A) and identified, in peaks 30 and 29, based on their molecular masses: 18,367.30 and 18,281.21&#xA0;Da, respectively (Fig. 1B). A lactosyl-&#x3B2;-LG conjugate (Mr&#xA0;=&#xA0;18,605.27&#xA0;Da), due to a covalently bound lactose residue, was also detected in peak 28 for the B variant, whereas the lactosyl conjugate of the A variant was co-eluted with the native &#x3B2;-lactoglobulin A, in peak 30. Free NH2 groups of basic amino acids, identified by L&#xE9;onil et al. (1995) as K47 in bovine lactosyl-&#x3B2;-LG, react with the reducing carbonyl group of lactose forming the so-called Amadori products.
          Although &#x3B1;s2-CN (peaks 6&#x2013;8) and &#x3B1;-LA (peak 27) show genetic polymorphisms (Martin, Bianchi et al., 2013), these two proteins were quite monomorphic: variants A and B, respectively, in the bovine populations studied. However, &#x3B1;s2-CN displays a high molecular diversity due to its phosphate content.

          3.1.2
          Discrimination of isoforms arising from post-translational modifications and splicing anomalies
          As shown in Fig. 2 and Table 1 (analysis of an individual FHF milk sample), a first resolution level of &#x3B1;s2-CN isoforms was obtained according to its number of phosphate groups thanks to the high efficiency of the chromatographic separation. Indeed, peaks 6, 7 and 8 correspond to isoforms 10-11P, 12P, and 13-14P, respectively. However, using mass data, the resolution is refined to distinguish a minimum of seven isoforms, ranging between 8 and 14 phosphate groups (Supplementary material S1). In some milk samples, an isoform with up to 15P was found (Fang et al., 2016).Fig. 2RP-HPLC profile of an individual bovine milk sample. The chromatogram profile was partitioned into 29 peaks whose contents were identified from the data generated by the mass spectrometer (Table 1).Fig. 3Improved resolution of bovine milk proteins by RP-HPLC using an extended acetonitrile gradient. Milk was sampled from a cow of the following genotype: AB, AA, BC, A2I, BB and AB, respectively, at the CSN3, CSN1S2, CSN1S1, CSN2, LALBA, BLG/PAEP loci. The chromatogram profile (upper panel) was partitioned into 42 peaks whose contents were identified from the data generated by the mass spectrometer (Supplementary material S5). The glycosylated &#x3BA;-CN (peak 1, framed in red), the &#x3B1;s1-CN cluster (framed in green), including peaks 22 to 26 and the &#x3B2;-CN cluster (framed in blue), including peaks 33 to 36, were subjected to an in-depth MS analysis to identify and quantify from deconvoluted mass signals, genetic variants and isoforms with different levels of PTM. &#x3BA;-CN variants A and B and their glycosylated isoforms present in peak 1 were distinguished and quantified and the composition in N-acetyl galactosamine (GaN), Galactose (Ga) and Sialic Acid (SA) of their glycosylation units deduced. &#x3B1;s1-CN variants B and C, with 8P (peak 23, B) and 9P (peak 25, C) were easily distinguished and quantified. Masses and intensities corresponding to different isoforms are indicated with green arrows. &#x3B2;-CN variants A2-5P (peak 34, D) and I-5P (peak 35, E) were as well easily distinguished and quantified. Masses and intensities corresponding to &#x3B2;-CN allelic variants are indicated with blue arrows. (For interpretation of the references to colour in this figure legend, the reader is referred to the web version of this article.)Table 1Identification and quantification of the different isoforms of the six major proteins in cow&#x2019;s milk. Identification of bovine milk proteins found under most of the 29 peaks of the RP-HPLC chromatogram (Fig. 2) from observed molecular masses compared to theoretical masses. Quantification was achieved from the intensity of the deconvoluted mass signal.Theoretical masses were determined using the online Expasy PeptideMass resource, as average Mr from protein sequence entries in UniProtKB. The same specific colour code defined at Fig. 1 has been adopted here for the 6 main bovine milk protein families.
          With regards to glycosylation, which here mainly concerns &#x3BA;-CN, we have seen that most of the glycosylated &#x3BA;-CN isoforms were eluted as a single peak (peak 1) at the beginning of the chromatogram (Fig. 1A). However, some glycosylated &#x3BA;-CN isoforms can be found all along the chromatogram (see Table 1 and &#xA7; quantification). The detailed analysis of the multi-charged ions spectrum provides, after deconvolution, a series of masses corresponding to different O-glycosylation levels (see Fig. 3).
          We also observed the existence of minor non-allelic isoforms of &#x3B1;s1-CN (Table 1, within peaks 11 and 14), with masses matching that displayed by genetic variants A (skipping of exon 4) and H (skipping of exon 8). In addition, isoforms corresponding to &#x3B1;s1-CN having lost Q59 and/or Q78 residues (Table 1, peaks 14 and 17) due to the use of cryptic intra exon splice sites (CAG codon at the 5&#x2032; end of the exon) during the course of messenger RNA processing, were detected. This phenomenon is well known and documented, particularly with regard to &#x3B1;s1-casein. It has been reported in almost all mammalian species including cattle and water buffalo (Martin et al., 2013). An additional isoform, hitherto unknown, displaying a putative deletion of exon 12 was also found in peak 17. Therefore, even if this kind of phenomenon is especially frequent with other species, including small ruminants, non-allelic splicing variants also occur in cattle and concerns, to a lesser extent, all three Ca-sensitive CN. Indeed, a mass corresponding to the &#x3B1;s2-CN D variant, characterized by a defective splicing of the precursor to mRNA leading to the loss of exon 8 (Martin, Bianchi et al., 2013), was detected among masses present in peak 5, in some individuals. Similarly, a &#x3B2;-CN non-allelic variant having lost the peptide sequence (ESITRINK), encoded by exon 5, was detected in peak 19 (Table 1). These exon-skipping phenomena were confirmed for both &#x3B1;s1-CN and &#x3B2;-CN in LC&#x2013;MS/MS (Supplementary material S2).
          By enriching the theoretical mass database with masses of hydrolysis products from caseins by plasmin, it becomes possible to extend the analysis to the identification and relative quantification of molecules such as &#x3B3;-CN and their complements (e.g. PP5), as well as peptides derived from &#x3B1;s1-CN. Thus, in peak 10 (Fig. 1B) we identified peptides corresponding to the proteose-peptone component 5 (PP5, f(1&#x2013;105) &#x3B2;-CN A2/A3) with 4 and 5 phosphate residues (with observed masses of 12,096.3734 and 12,177.1687&#xA0;Da). As a consequence, &#x3B3;3-CN, f(108&#x2013;209) &#x3B2;-CN, was detected in peak 26 as a molecule of Mr 11,568.48&#xA0;Da.

        Quantitative determination of milk proteins

          3.2.1
          Recording absorbance at 214&#xA0;nm to target quantification of milk protein families
          Proteins identified under each of the major chromatographic peaks, defined by recording the absorbance at 214&#xA0;nm, belong to the same protein family and account for most of their surface area. It is therefore possible to make a relative quantification of each peak of the chromatogram by expressing its surface as a percentage of the total area of the peaks of the chromatogram. The absorbance of a protein at 214&#xA0;nm is generally considered as being proportional to the number of peptide bonds it contains. However, its content in aromatic amino acid residues may impact the measurement. Thus, to overcome such a pitfall, corrective factors were introduced, taking into account the content in aromatic amino acids of each protein, based on its molar extinction coefficient (&#x3B5;) at 280&#xA0;nm. Since the number of peptide bonds per gram of protein is essentially the same for all the main milk proteins, the area of each peak of the chromatogram, expressed as a percentage of the total area of all peaks, allows a relative quantification of each protein. Thus, the amount of each major bovine milk protein resolved in RP-HPLC under the conditions used (Fig. 1A), including genetic variants and differently phosphorylated isoforms, expressed in percent, is given in Fig. 1B as relative area. Because of their distribution in more than one peak, to get an individual protein composition, i.e. to quantify the four CN and the main two whey proteins (&#x3B1;-LA and &#x3B2;-LG) of the milk sample, it is possible to integrate peaks relevant to the same protein family. In such a way, the relative amount of &#x3B1;s2-CN, regardless of its phosphorylation levels, was estimated (8.43%) by summing the areas of peaks 6, 7 and 8. Similarly, peaks 14, 15, 17, 19 and 20, which correspond to different &#x3B1;s1-CN B and C isoforms, as well as peaks 22&#x2013;26 which correspond to the four &#x3B2;-CN genetic variants, can be combined to assess the overall &#x3B1;s1-CN (29.64%) and &#x3B2;-CN (38.61%, including &#x3B3;3-CN and its complements, in particular PP5) relative contents, respectively, in the milk sample. With regards to &#x3BA;-CN, it is possible to aggregate or distinguish glycosylated and non-glycosylated &#x3BA;-CN, although glycosylated &#x3BA;-CN seems to be underestimated (see thereafter).
          Therefore, the average distribution of the different protein families could be estimated. They were determined on a panel of 240 individual milk samples from Montb&#xE9;liarde cows, compared with previous data available in the literature (Table 2). Interestingly, the introduction of the above mentioned corrective factors significantly modifies the quantitative results with decreases in the relative proportions of &#x3BA;-CN and &#x3B2;-CN and conversely an increase in the relative proportions of &#x3B1;s-CNs, as well as &#x3B2;-LG.Table 2Average distribution of the different protein families, estimated on a panel of 240 individual milk samples from Montb&#xE9;liarde cows, and compared with data from the literature.*Holstein, good milk coagulation class; total CN&#xA0;=&#xA0;area of all peaks in the CN-elution interval of the chromatogram.**Including BSA that co-elutes with &#x3B1;-LA Correction was for absorbance at 280&#xA0;nm. Re-assignment of proteolysis product was performed considering that others when &gt;5% were mainly proteolysis products from caseins: &#x3B2;-CN (70%), &#x3B1;s1-CN (17%) and &#x3BA;-CN (13%).
          A histogram of relative concentrations for each of the six main milk proteins measured on these 240 milk samples revealed an extreme individual variability with amplitudes from single to double, even triple, especially for &#x3BA;-CN and &#x3B2;-LG (Supplementary material S3). Such a variability is largely explained by the main allelic variants (A and B) occurring at both these loci in the Montb&#xE9;liarde population, since they are known to be expressed at different levels, as previously reported in other breeds (Bobe et al., 1998, Heck et al., 2008).
          To validate the approach and convert the relative amounts (calculated from surfaces of the chromatogram peaks at 214&#xA0;nm) into g/Kg milk, 10 milk samples from FHF cows were analyzed in LC-MS and their total protein content was determined by the amido-black technique. The average value of the total protein of the 10 milks was 31.16&#xA0;g/Kg, ranging between 39 and 27.7&#xA0;g/Kg. From their relative quantities expressed as a percentage of the peak area, the true amount, in g/Kg, were for each of the 6 major milk proteins: 3.00, 3.01, 10.39, 10.84, 1.05 and 2.89&#xA0;g/Kg for &#x3BA;-CN, &#x3B1;s2-CN, &#x3B1;s1-CN, &#x3B2;-CN, &#x3B1;-LA and &#x3B2;-LG, respectively, in agreement with the literature data (Supplementary material S4).

          3.2.2
          Quantitative determination of protein isoforms from the intensity of the mass signal
          Before considering the possibility of using the Intensity of the deconvoluted Mass Signal (IMS) to quantify different isoforms of each main bovine milk protein, we first evaluated the impact of structural features, such as post-translational modifications and genetic variants, on the ionization abilities of the six main milk proteins.

            3.2.2.1
            Genetic variants and ionization ability
            Milk samples were from cows chosen for their representativeness as genetic variants of major bovine milk proteins: variants A1, A2, A3, I and B for &#x3B2;-CN, variants A, E and B for &#x3BA;-CN and variants A and B for &#x3B2;-LG. Since &#x3B1;s2-CN and &#x3B1;-LA are essentially monomorphic, these proteins were not considered. The results obtained show little or no effect of genetic variants on the ability of proteins to ionize. Indeed, the different genetic variants analyzed for both &#x3B2;-CN (A2, A3 and B) and &#x3BA;-CN (A, B and E) gave essentially the same A214/IMS ratio, except &#x3B2;-CN A1 which gives a slightly higher A214/IMS ratio (3.8 vs 3.4), thus suggesting a lower ionization aptitude for this variant. This was confirmed by the analysis of a milk from a Montb&#xE9;liarde cow, heterozygous A1/B at the CSN2 locus which gave significantly different mass signal intensities 53,326 vs. 46,070 for variants B and A1 (peaks 19 and 20, Table 1) whereas A214 were very similar for these two peaks. It is worth noting that the A214/IMS ratio remained of the same order for caseins, while it is about twice as low for variants of &#x3B2;-LG, suggesting a better ionization efficiency for this protein.

            3.2.2.2
            Effect of the phosphorylation level of caseins
            Regarding &#x3B1;s1-CN and &#x3B2;-CN, little or no effect of phosphorylation was observed (results not shown). By contrast, a significant effect was recorded for &#x3B1;s2-CN that displays the highest phosphorylation level, ranging between 7 and 14 phosphate groups (Fang et al., 2016). Consequently, the risk of underestimation of &#x3B1;s2-CN in the case of absolute quantification is real, but not in the case of a relative quantification (comparison between milk samples). The effect was even more marked when the injected volume of the sample was low (Supplementary material S6). With an injected volume of 5&#xA0;&#xB5;L the impact on the other caseins (&#x3B1;s1-CN and &#x3B2;-CN) is no longer negligible. However, it must be considered, at least in cattle, that the phosphorylation level of those caseins is rarely zero, which further gives a relative dimension to the observed effect and justifies not taking into account this factor, except for &#x3B1;s2-CN.

            3.2.2.3
            Quantitative determination of protein isoforms present in each peak
            After having analyzed the effects of the main influencing factors (genetic variants and PTM status), correction factors were determined and applied to convert the IMSs (deconvoluted spectra) in relative proportion (expressed in %) of each identified protein molecule. Thus, it is possible to decompose each compound corresponding to the different UV peaks into their different isoforms and quantify them. For example, the B and A1 variants of &#x3B2;-CN, which correspond to peaks 19 and 20 in Fig. 2, respectively, can be broken down in isoforms according to their phosphorylation levels (4 and 5P). Those peaks also contained molecular species very likely derived from &#x3B2;-CN that we were not able to identify, based on their molecular masses, as well as a splicing variant (exon 5 skipping) with two phosphate residues (Table 1). The IMSs observed with these different isoforms makes it possible to quantify each of them. It appears that the 5P isoform, that is overwhelmingly predominant, represents nearly 80% of all isoforms both in peaks 19 (B variant) and 20 (A1 variant). The 4P and exon five skipped isoforms, each represent only ca. 3% of all &#x3B2;-CN isoforms. Under the optimized chromatographic conditions used, &#x3B3;3-CN is eluted after &#x3B2;-CN A3 (peak 26, Fig. 1; peak 23 in Fig. 2 and Table 1), and can therefore be quantified, in contrast to what has been previously reported (Bobe et al., 1998, Groen et al., 1994).
            Similarly, multiple &#x3B1;s1-CN isoforms, including splicing isoforms arising from skipping of exons 4, 8 or 12, from the usage of intra-exon cryptic splice sites (&#x394;Q78 and/or &#x394;Q59), as well as isoforms with different phosphorylation levels, which are distributed in peaks 11, 14, 16 and 17 (Fig. 2), can be individually quantified from their IMS (Table 1). Again, isoforms corresponding to the full-length protein, with eight (peak 16) and nine (peak 17) phosphate groups that account for 60 and 16% of the &#x3B1;s1-CN family, respectively, are mainly represented, whereas splicing variants account for ca. 10%. Furthermore, it is worth noting the possible presence of small amounts, in peak 16, of a glycosylated isoform of &#x3BA;-CN B that can be reassigned to the &#x3BA;-CN family. A similar situation was observed for peak 6, which contained, in addition to &#x3B1;s2-CN 10 and 11P, a molecule possibly corresponding to a glycosylated isoform of &#x3BA;-CN B-2P.
            &#x3B1;s2-CN is distributed in 3 peaks (6, 7 and 8), not completely resolved, corresponding to differently phosphorylated isoforms (10 to 14P) that can be easily quantified individually from the IMS data, whereas quantification based on peak area would be impossible. Thus, we were able to estimate the proportion of each &#x3B1;s2-CN phosphorylation isoform, as a fraction of total &#x3B1;s2-CN. &#x3B1;s2-CN with 11 and 12P were the most abundant isoforms with 47 and 26%, respectively, in agreement with previously reported results in the Montb&#xE9;liarde breed (Fang et al., 2016). However, the relative proportions of these isoforms are prone to vary widely among individual cows. Given the involvement of phosphate in the casein micelle structure, there is a range of genetic progress to explore in this direction.
            Although they are rather well resolved and possibly quantified from absorbance at 214&#xA0;nm, &#x3B1;s1-CN B isoforms with 8 and 9 phosphate were more precisely quantified using the IMS, as shown in Fig. 3. Interestingly, by slightly modifying the chromatographic conditions, exemplified by milk #57 protein profiling (Fig. 3), we succeeded in improving the separation between &#x3B1;s1-CN isoforms (peaks 22 to 26), including genetic variants B and C, which allows their quantification as well as a more accurate quantification of &#x3B1;s1-CN-8P and &#x3B1;s1-CN-9P (Fig. 3, Supplementary material S5). However, since additional isoforms arising mainly from splicing anomalies and a lower phosphorylation isoform (&#x3B1;s1-CN-7P) also occur in several peaks (from peak 18 to 26) together with unidentified masses, mass signal intensity is undoubtedly the best way to quantify precisely if not all of the &#x3B1;s1-CN isoforms, at least a large number of them. In such a way, we estimated the relative proportions of &#x3B1;s1-CN with 7P, 8P and 9P to be ca. 5, 70 and 25%, respectively. For comparison, the ratio of &#x3B1;s1-CN 8P to &#x3B1;s1-CN 9P based on the area of peaks (23 and 25) at 214&#xA0;nm is 3.5, vs. 2.8 in IMS. In addition, in such chromatographic conditions, we also achieved the beginning of a resolution of &#x3B2;-CN A2 and I variants (Fig. 3, peaks 34 and 35).
            A thorough analysis of the LC&#x2013;MS data (Supplementary material S5 and Fig. 3) from the LC-MS in long gradient conditions revealed that:1 &#x2013; &#x3BA;-casein (peaks 1&#x2013;9) exists, whether variant A or B, mainly as a mono-phosphorylated form, together with a minor isoform (&lt;10%) bearing two phosphate residues, the main phosphorylation site being residue S149, whereas the second one is S121, according to Holland and Boland (2014);2 &#x2013; in agreement with literature (Van Eenennaam &amp; Medrano, 1991), the B variant is more expressed (+80%) than the A;3 &#x2013; variant B shows a greater diversity of glycan patterns and a higher level of glycosylation (number of modified sites), the major glycan motif being a tetrasaccharide composed of Galactose (Ga), N-acetylgalactosamine (GaN) and Sialic or neuraminic Acid (SA) of the form SA-Ga-GaN[SA];4 &#x2013; the glycoforms mainly represented in variants A and B are different, 1P-1OG (1 tetrasaccharide unit) on variant A and 1P-2OG (2 tetrasaccharide units) on variant B;5 &#x2013; taking into account the impact of glycosylation on the IMS (Wada, 2012), the Glyco/Non-Glyco ratio was estimated to be 50/50 for variant A while it was close to 60/40 for variant B, consistent with the literature (Holland &amp; Boland, 2014).

      Qualification of the LC-MS method
      The global validation of the RP-HPLC method applied to bovine milk has been previously demonstrated for chromatograms recorded at 214&#xA0;nm (Bonfatti et al., 2008, Bordin et al., 2001). Bonfatti et al. (2008) reported a linear relationship between the concentrations of milk proteins and peak areas over the range of bovine milk protein content. They estimated the precision (repeatability and reproducibility) as satisfactory for both retention times and peak areas.
      In agreement with their results, we also observed a good reproducibility and repeatability for retention times (even from one column to another) and peak areas (results not shown), provided corrective factors, taking into account the bias introduced by specific absorbance at 280&#xA0;nm, have been determined for each protein and applied to the measurement of absorbance at 214&#xA0;nm.
      However, it remains to validate the quantitative determination of protein isoforms from the deconvoluted mass signals by evaluating the linearity and the intermediate precision (repeatability and reproducibility) as well as the accuracy of the LC&#x2013;MS method.

        4.1
        Results of linearity tests
        Each sample corresponding to the 11 levels of milk protein concentration was analyzed by the LC-MS method, in duplicate. A simple linear regression and a curvilinear regression (order 2) were calculated systematically by taking the raw deconvoluted IMS data on the ordinates and the theoretical (calculated) milk protein levels on the abscissa. In case of non-linearity, a second treatment was performed as a linear regression on the graphically observed linearity range. An Ar/At ratio (Ar and At being the amplitude of IMS residues and amplitude of IMS units, respectively) was calculated on each linear regression performed (over the entire rate range and the smaller range). For the six proteins tested, the response is not linear over the entire range (from 0 to 87&#xA0;g.L&#x2212;1 of total protein), i.e. between 0 and 5.2&#xA0;g.L&#x2212;1 of non-glycosylated &#x3BA;-CN, for which we observe a ratio Ar/At&#xA0;=&#xA0;15.9%. Interestingly, the response of the method was curvilinear over the entire range (Fig. 4A). The R2 increased from 0.9769 for linear regression to 0.9929 for curvilinear regression. However, a linear response was observed between 0 and 43&#xA0;g.L&#x2212;1 total protein (i.e. from 0 to 2.6&#xA0;g.L&#x2212;1 non-glycosylated &#x3BA;-CN casein). The linear regression performed over this range gave an Ar/At ratio of 3.3% and an R2 of 0.9966. Quite the same situation was recorded with all four caseins, as well as with whey proteins (Supplementary material S6). Interestingly, the widest linear range registered was between 8 and 78&#xA0;g.L&#x2212;1 of total milk protein, with &#x3B1;-LA (0.27 to 2.48&#xA0;g.L&#x2212;1). A linear regression over this range gave an Ar/At ratio of 6.7%.Fig. 4Qualification of the LC-MS method to quantify allelic variants as well as PTM isoforms of the six main bovine milk proteins from the intensity of mass signal. Linear (a) and curvilinear (b) tests on non-glycosylated &#x3BA;-CN. Linear test on the graphically observed linearity range (c). Accuracy test (d) was estimated from increasing spiking amounts of three purified (purity ranging between 90 and 95%) bovine milk proteins: &#x3B1;s1-CN B-(8P&#xA0;+&#xA0;9P), &#x3B2;-CN A2-5P and &#x3B1;-LA of which concentrations were 0.725, 0.118 and 0.157&#xA0;&#xB5;g/&#xB5;L, respectively.
        From an overall point of view, we conclude that the method is not strictly linear over the entire range tested (0 to 87&#xA0;g.L&#x2212;1 protein). However, the method, as parameterized, is linear over a total protein content range of 8 to 43&#xA0;g.L&#x2212;1, which is more than sufficient for analyzing cow and goat milks. For the analysis of ewe&#x2019;s milk, a &#xBD; dilution of the starting sample is required.

        4.2
        Intermediate precision
        The intermediate precision of the LC-MS method was evaluated by estimating the intra-laboratory repeatability and reproducibility. The results obtained for the six major bovine milk proteins and some isoforms and variants are summarized in Supplementary material S6. The Relative Standard Deviation for repeatability (RSDr) values varied between 2.2 and 5.3% according to the protein (except for &#x3B1;-LA and &#x3B1;s2-CN A-12P for which the RSDr values were 11.7 and 13.6%, respectively), genetic variants and isoforms tested.
        The following parameters, Sr and SR (standard deviation of repeatability and reproducibility within the laboratory) and r and R (maximum deviation between doubles and maximum reproducibility deviation), were determined for each type of expression, i.e. in relative percentage of total protein (%) and in g per liter of milk (g.L&#x2212;1), for each milk protein. The results obtained for the six major bovine milk proteins and some isoforms and variants are summarized in Supplementary material S6. The Relative Standard Deviation for reproducibility (RSDR) values ranged between 3.68 and 16.92% according to the proteins, genetic variants and isoforms tested.

        4.3
        Accuracy
        From samples spiked at six different levels (see M &amp; M section) with pure protein isolates, Average Recovery Coefficients (ARC) have been calculated for &#x3B1;s1-CN-8P and 9P, &#x3B2;-CN A2-5P and &#x3B1;-LA (Fig. 4). ARC ranged between 94.3% (&#x3B1;s1-CN-8P) and 101.4% (&#x3B1;-LA), with ARC of 97.0 and 100.6% for &#x3B1;s1-CN-9P and &#x3B2;-CN A2-5P, respectively (Supplementary material S6).

      Concluding remarks
      Originally, this method was designed and developed as an anchoring method for the establishment of equations to predict the composition of six major milk proteins (4 caseins, &#x3B2;-LG and &#x3B1;-LA) from MIR spectra in the bovine milk protein fraction (Ferrand et al., 2012). However, in view of the power and potential of the tool, we continued its development to provide even more precise and detailed information, leading to the identification of most of the isoforms of each protein family including genetic variants, splicing variants and isoforms resulting from post-translational modifications. To achieve this, the chromatographic conditions were optimized and the theoretical mass database was concomitantly gradually expanded to reach today nearly 3000 molecular mass references. The method still needs to be improved, even if it has already led to significant progress in various fields, particularly in Genetics (Sanchez et al., 2016) and Physiology (Fang et al., 2016). An issue that remains to be addressed concerns the identity of minor compounds present under a peak, displaying masses not listed in our database. Those are often close to the theoretical mass of the main compound, but likely result from chemical modifications (adducts) occurring during sample storage and/or processing. This is particularly the case for &#x3B2;-LG and &#x3B1;-LA that occur with multiple masses. Nevertheless, depending on the status of the cows at each locus (homozygous or heterozygous), up to one hundred molecules derived from the six major milk proteins can be identified and quantified in an individual milk sample, even though ca. 1/3 of the masses giving a signal of significant intensity (globally accounting for less than 6% of the milk proteins) could not be formally identified.
      Given its &#x201C;versatility&#x201D;, this profiling method has no equivalent. Indeed, besides a coarse composition, by protein family, it makes a fine phenotyping possible, which goes well beyond the simple identification of genetic variants. Indeed, its accuracy and its resolving power provide the possibility to identify and quantify most of the protein isoforms arising from PTM, from defective splicing as well as proteolysis products (with the possibility of reassigning them to the family of origin).
      It is important to stress that the pre-treatment of the sample is an essential point in order to obtain reliable results. The option taken was to make this pre-treatment minimal. The samples therefore underwent a simple centrifugation skimming process, under mild conditions, so that the largest micelles do not precipitate. In such a way, the differences between observed and theoretical masses (accuracy) are very small (lower than 0.35 Dalton on average) for the main isoforms, which makes it easier to interpret the data. However, identification based on the observed molecular mass, remains a relative limitation because in rare circumstances this feature alone is not sufficient. Indeed, in some cases it is difficult to conclude definitively on the nature of the &#x201C;identified&#x201D; molecule. That is why it is highly recommended to take into account the elution time even though it is not always completely consistent: e.g. &#x3B1;s1-CN B 8P &#x394; (Q59 and Q78), which was eluted in peak 6 (Table 1) and consequently well upstream of the elution zone of &#x3B1;s1-CN. Similarly, in the same milk sample, a mass of 22,691.36&#xA0;Da identified a highly glycosylated &#x3BA;-CN with 2P groups (theoretical mass 22,691.54&#xA0;Da) which was eluted in peak 26 among &#x3B1;s1-CN isoforms. It is therefore useful to be able to verify the nature of the molecule, which LC-MS/MS could allow.
      Another crucial point is the time spent for an analysis. While the run itself, set at 30&#xA0;min. for routine analyses, remains acceptable, the interpretation and extraction of data is by far longer and requires the development and implementation of automation tools (in progress).
      It is also valuable to highlight here the wide range of investigation possibilities in the dairy industry. This method has proven effective in monitoring the degradation of caseins (&#x3B1;s1- and &#x3B2;-CN) during their conservation (milk bank kept at the Centre de Ressources Biologiques (CRB) animales, INRAE, Jouy). This ability to precisely identify and quantify large proteolysis products is a key tool for monitoring casein degradation during cheese ripening (under study). It has also demonstrated its effectiveness in assessing the impact of different farming practices (dietary restrictions, single milking) on the protein composition of milk (unpublished results), and it could potentially be useful to characterize ingredients used to prepare infant formulas.
      Finally, this method can be applied to all mammalian species with a minimum of RP-HPLC separation condition development and the creation of a specific mass database. In this respect, recent studies on small ruminants (goats, &#x201C;MilkChEST&#x201D; program, Martin et al., manuscript in preparation), rabbits (maternal high-fat/high-sugar obesogenic diet, Hue-Beauvais et al., 2017) and camelids (Ryskaliyeva et al., 2019) are worth mentioning.
