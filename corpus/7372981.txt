modities in Indonesia, which is consumed
as meat and processed products such as meatball. Increasing beef demand as a main
ingredient of meatballs, which is not balanced with sufficient supply of beef,
creates an opportunity to adulterate and mix beef with other meat sources. Consumers
find it difficult to prove which original beef or adulterated beef by bare eyes; it
is even more challenging to identify beef adulteration in processed products.
Adulteration of raw beef with other meats and its processed products can cause
various problems, including consumer satisfaction, social problems, particular
religious preferences, and other problems related to health hazards associated with
certain types of substances from certain types of meat (Kumar et al., 2014).
      Cases of beef adulteration are not only limited to substitution with pork (Ha et al., 2017). In Indonesia, beef
adulteration is also mixed with dog and rat meats due to both types of meat is
served as food in some cities (Weichart,
2004). The level of dog meat consumption in Asia, especially in Indonesia, is
reasonably high because of eating dog meat is culturally permitted behavior in
several Indonesian regions. It is reported that around one thousand dogs are
slaughtered and served as food every week (Podberscek, 2009; Weichart,
2004). In the Europe, the idea of consuming dog meat is seen as something
disgusting because, generally, dogs are kept as pets (Podberscek, 2009). Meat from dog, pig, and rat species has been
regulated by criteria for prohibited consumption in Islamic law (Fadzlillah et al., 2011). In addition, these
types of animals also have the potential to become zoonotic agents (Fajardo et al., 2010; Hamidi, 2018). If this type of meat is used in multi-species
adulteration, it will be harmful not only for Moslem but also for all consumers.
      Labeling regulation requires that compositions of meat products must be clearly
stated in the package to protect the worldwide consumer from deviant meat products
(Abuzinadah et al., 2015; Doosti et al., 2014). Stating composition in the
package is obviously intended to protect consumers from fraud and adulteration.
Sometimes producers of beef product do not provide clear information in the package,
and they are often deliberately mixed beef with pork and its derivatives due to the
obvious economic benefits in some countries like Korea, Japan, and China where beef
is much expensive than pork (Ha et al.,
2017).
      The DNA-based method much more effective than using physical properties of meat in
determining of meat species origin (Tathma et al.,
2019). The application of this method for identification species origin
contained in meat products using polymerase chain reaction (PCR) technique is
frequently applied because DNA is quite stable against high temperature, pressure,
and chemical treatments (Fajardo et al., 2010;
Saez et al., 2004). The multiplex-PCR
method uses more than one primer in one PCR tube. Therefore, it can be used to
analyze large sample quantities, saving time, cost, and it is also highly sensitive
(Dalmasso et al., 2004). Most of the
previous studies develop mitochondrial genome such as Cytochrome b and 12S rRNA
genes as target sites for phylogenetic, evolution, and species identification
studies due to their unique nucleotides and maternally inherited to the offspring.
The 12S rRNA region has been used for species identification in raw meats using
multiplex-PCR assay (Cahyadi et al., 2018;
Cahyadi et al., 2019). Therefore, the
objective of this study was to detect intentionally contaminated beef meatball with
three non-halal meats (dog, pork, and rat) using multiplex-PCR with the 12S rRNA
region designed as target sites.

      Materials and Methods

        Meat samples
        The samples of beef and pork were collected from traditional markets in Surakarta
City. Dog and rat meats were collected from meat sellers who are not willing to
be published to the public. Each meat sample was put into a zip locked plastic
bag and tagged with a specific name and stored separately to avoid
cross-contamination among samples until used for further process in the
refrigerator at 4&#xB0;C.

        Producing of self-made meatball
        Meats were thawed and cut into small pieces using sharp knives. They were ground
using different meat grinder for each meat species (Meat Mincer LH-22CW, Huamei,
Zhejiang, China). Ground meats were gently mixed with wheat flour, garlic
powder, salt, and pepper until homogeneous. Ingredient of each sample unit is
presented in Table 1. Furthermore,
meatball doughs were shaped like a ball by hand, and then they were boiled for
20 minutes until floating. Cooked meatballs were drained and left at room
temperature. Finally, they were separately stored in the freezer at
&#x2212;20&#xB0;C until used for the subsequent analysis. The process of
making meatball in this study used different equipment for each sample unit to
prevent cross-contamination among samples (Sari
et al., 2017).

rat meatball; SBT, beef, pork, and rat meatball; SABT, beef, dog,
pork, and rat meatball.

        Meatball samples in this study were divided into eleven sample units (Table 1). Every unit has three
replications. Samples of S, A, B, and T meatballs were set for simplex-PCR,
duplex- (SA, SB, and ST), and multiplex-PCR (SAB, SAT, SBT, and SABT) were made
based on a combination of the composition of meat from beef (S), dog (A), pork
(B), and rat (T). Those samples were used to test the uniqueness and specificity
of the 12S rRNA gene primers using genomic DNA templates extracted from
meatballs.

        Isolation of genomic DNA
        The genomic DNA was extracted according to the procedure of gsyncTM DNA
extraction kit for tissue (Geneaid Biotech, Taipei, Taiwan). The isolated
genomic DNA was stored at &#x2212;20&#xB0;C until used for PCR (Yacoub and Sadek, 2016). To evaluate the
quality of isolated genomic DNA, 1% agarose gel electrophoresis was
performed at 100 Volts for 30 minutes. Moreover, stained agorose gel was put
into gel document to capture photograph (Bio-Rad Gel Doc&#x2122; XR
+, USA).

        Polymerase chain reaction (PCR)
        The genomic DNA extracted from the meatball sample was used as a DNA template for
the purpose of obtaining specific segments of the 12S rRNA gene as target using
primers previously reported by Cahyadi et al.
(2018) and Cahyadi et al.
(2019). Primer pairs are shown in Table 2. Simplex-, duplex-, and multiplex-PCR reactions were carried
out using a thermal cycler machine (GeneAmp&#xAE; PCR System 9700,
Singapore). The total volume of reaction in the microtube was 25 &#x3BC;L
consisting of 12.5 &#x3BC;L MyTaq&#x2122; HS Red Mix (Bioline,
London, UK), 1 &#x3BC;L genomic DNA template (10 ng/&#x3BC;L), 1 &#x3BC;L
forward primer, 1 &#x3BC;L each reverse primer, and ddH2O adjusted
until reach 25 &#x3BC;L total volume. Simplex-PCR only contained one primer
pair, duplex-PCR contained two primer pairs (bovine primers and another species
primers), and multiplex-PCR contained all primer pairs. The concentration of
each primer in the reaction was 10 &#x3BC;M. The PCR reaction was started with
an initial denaturation at 95&#xB0;C for 3 minutes and followed by 30 cycles
of denaturation at 95&#xB0;C for 15 seconds, annealing at 64&#xB0;C for 30
seconds, and then extension at 72&#xB0;C for 30 seconds. The PCR process was
completed by final extension at 72&#xB0;C for 3 minutes. Finally, PCR products
were electrophoresed using 2% agarose gel at 100 Volts for 30 minutes.
Electrophoresis results were visualized using a gel document machine (Gel
Doc&#x2122; XR+, Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA, USA). The 100 bp
marker ladder was used as a standard size of the DNA band.

      Results

        Simplex-PCR
        Simplex-PCR was conducted using meatball samples containing one species of meat
origin. The result showed that primer pairs specifically for bovine, dog, pig,
and rat correctly amplified target sites. Physical and heat treatment of samples
during meatball-making did not affect DNA amplification. Simplex-PCR was
successfully performed which is indicated by 155, 244, 357, and 491 bp DNA bands
for bovine, dog, pig, and rat, respectively (Fig.
1). The simplex-PCR products were also evident. It indicated that DNA
extracted in this study was pure, and no other DNA sources originated from other
ingredients or RNA contamination. Therefore, every component in the reaction can
be simultaneously working to produce specific and clear DNA bands.

        Duplex-PCR
        The aim of duplex-PCR was to check the possibility of non-halal meats
contaminating beef. The beef was intentionally contaminated with pork, dog, and
rat meats that represented non-halal meats. The result showed that duplex-PCR
was also successfully carried out. Two DNA bands can be noticed corresponding to
bovine and dog/porcine/rat specific segments (Fig.
1). The DNA bands were also clear and bright. These results suggested
that two DNA genomics successfully extracted from treated meats with excellent
purity and concentration of DNA genomes.

        Multiplex-PCR
        Triplex- and tetraplex PCRs represented multiplex-PCR. In these tests, beef
samples were mixed all together with other meats. The existence of three DNA
bands indicated the triplex PCR. Also, the tetraplex PCR was indicated by four
DNA bands identified in the agarose gel. The results of multiplex-PCR using the
12S rRNA gene as target sites indicated that this novel multiplex-PCR was
powerful enough to identify non-halal meats in meatballs. The DNA bands can be
seen in the samples containing multi DNA sources, except the SAT sample (Fig. 1). The DNA band for the rat in the SAT
mixture was slight, and it was not as bright as other bands. It may be due to
the low concentration of rat genomic DNA extracted from the SAT sample; however,
it still can be seen by the bare eyes. To prove specificity of primers, multiple
alignment analysis of the 12S rRNA gene sequences obtained from genbank is
provided in the Fig. 2.

            Accession numbers of the reference sequences for bovine, dog, porcine,

respectively. Forward primer (F) and complementary sequences of
species-specific reverse primers are indicated by black boxes. Dots and
grey boxes indicate identical and different nucleotides to the primer
sequences, respectively.

      Discussion
      The DNA bands of each species in the simplex-, duplex-, and multiplex-PCR were
explicitly detected. The primer pairs accurately amplified target sites of the 12S
rRNA gene. Heat and physical treatment of meats did not affect the PCR results. The
reactions were working well, which are indicated by specific and unique DNA bands
for each species. The previous study reported that high processing temperatures up
to 160&#xB0;C did not affect the stability of the mitochondrial DNA 12S rRNA gene.
It still can be a target of amplification in the PCR (Lakzadeh et al., 2013). The primer pairs of the 12S rRNA gene
used in the present study can amplify the target area of the 12S rRNA gene using
genomic DNA extracted from meatball samples. This result was in agreement with
previous studies that successfully detected non-halal meats in raw meats (Cahyadi et al., 2018; Cahyadi et al., 2019).
      Detection of a mixture of beef, dog, pig, and rat in raw meat and processed products
such as meatballs has also been developed previously using the Cyt b gene (Novianty et al., 2016; Primasari, 2011; Rahman et al,
2014). The 12S rRNA gene primer in the present study has advantages,
namely using universal forward primers and specific reverse primers to produce
specific results. The primary 12S rRNA gene also has the same annealing temperature,
so the multiplex-PCR, which is using more than one primer pairs in one tube
reaction, generates more accurate amplification targets (Cahyadi et al., 2019). The PCR product size for each species was
consistent in the simplex-, duplex-, and also multiplex-PCR. In the SAT meatball,
the DNA band of rat species was less bright than other samples containing rat meat.
It may be due to a low concentration of extracted rat DNA genomic. Also, the DNA
concentration obtained from mix samples cannot be equal even though the meat
proportion in the SAT samples was identical. Every part of the meatball cannot be
extracted entirely since the reaction during the DNA extraction process cannot be
adequately controlled by hand. Degradation of DNA molecules due to heat and physical
treatments during processing may also lead to generating low DNA concentration and
amplicon of PCR (Di Pinto et al., 2007). The
less bright DNA band of multiplex-PCR samples may also be due to unspecific and
interference among primers. However, the primer designed in this study was carefully
checked by multiple alignment analysis of 12S rRNA gene sequences. The results
suggested that reverse primers were specific for each species. It was proved by no
identical nucleotide(s) at the three-prime end (3&#x2019;-end) found in reverse
primers. This criterion is absolutely necessary since different nucleotide(s) at the
3&#x2019;-end of the primer is required for successful multiplex-PCR (Matsunaga et al., 1999).
      Utilization of the 12S rRNA gene for species identification is previously reported
that it can identify species of origin in the feedstuffs up to 0.01% of the
DNA genome containing in the sample (Safdar and
Junejo, 2015). In terms of using meatballs, earlier reports explained
that duplex-PCR could detect up to only 1% chicken and pork contamination in
the meatball made from beef (Novianty et al.,
2016; Sari et al., 2017).
      This study developed the mitochondrial DNA 12S rRNA gene as a biomarker for non-halal
meats detection in processed meat product. This study also focused on identifying
more than one species prohibited to be eaten by Moslem using the 12S rRNA gene by
developing a multiplex PCR technique. There is no report yet regarded using the
multiplex-PCR 12S rRNA gene to identify species in the animal-based product.
Therefore, it could be a handy tool to be applied in the vast areas of the food
industry. The multiplex-PCR can simultaneously amplify several different DNA
sequences and gain more information in a single reaction, which leads to more
effective and efficient using conventional PCR. On the other hand, the development
of other PCRs such as PCR, PCR-RAPD, PCR-RFLP, species-specific PCR, and real-time
PCR to detect species in food products are considered to be less efficient because
they require the latest technology and high operational costs than multiplex-PCR
(Fajardo et al., 2010). The main motive
for most beef adulteration cases revealed in Indonesia is by mixing beef with large
quantities of other animal meats to reduce production costs and to get more
financial benefits (Ha et al., 2017). The
enactment of Law No. 33 of 2014 concerning Guaranteed halal products in Indonesia
makes the method of detecting non-halal ingredients in meat-based foods
essential.
      This novel multiplex-PCR with the 12S rRNA gene as a target for amplification could
be promising tools to detect existences of porcine, rat, and dog in meat products in
supporting Indonesian government policy. This novel finding could be an alternative
DNA-based testing method to identify non-halal meats and their derivative materials
in foods.
