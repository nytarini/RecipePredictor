        Formulated chicken nuggets which are low in fat and, high in dietary fiber and free from phosphate were developed by adding various levels of a konjac flour/xanthan gum (KF/XG) (3:1) mixture (0.2&#x2013;1.5&#xA0;%, w/w) and shiitake powder (SP) (1&#x2013;4&#xA0;%, w/w). A central composite rotatable design was used to investigate the influence of variables on the physical and sensory properties of nuggets and to optimize the formulated nugget formulation. The addition of the KF/XG mixture and SP was effective in improving nugget firmness and increasing hedonic scores for color, taste, flavor and overall acceptability. The nugget became darker with more SP was added. Optimal nuggets with 0.39&#xA0;% KF/XG mixture and 1.84&#xA0;% SP had reduced fat, higher dietary fiber and amino acids. After frozen (&#x2212;18&#xA0;&#xB1;&#xA0;2&#xA0;&#xB0;C) storage, optimal formulated nuggets showed slower decreased in moisture, hardness and chewiness compared to standard nuggets. Konjac flour and SP also lowered lipid oxidation in frozen formulated nuggets. A slight change in sensory score was observed in both nuggets were microbiologically safe after frozen storage for 75&#xA0;days.
