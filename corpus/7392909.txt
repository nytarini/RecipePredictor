 fermented by a symbiotic starter culture of Lactobacillus delbrueckii subsp. bulgaricus (L. bulgaricus)
and Streptococcus thermophilus [1]. Both bacteria provide metabolites which promote mutual growth, as the nutrients in milk are
not sufficient for their optimal growth [2, 3]. For example, L. bulgaricus produce
peptides by degrading milk protein using the cell-wall protease PrtB, supporting the growth of weakly proteolytic S. thermophilus [4, 5]. However, a minority of S. thermophilus strains have been reported to show high proteolytic activity and fast
acidification properties [6, 7]. Such S. thermophilus strains possess the
prtS gene coding the cell-wall protease PrtS, which hydrolyzes casein into peptides [8]. Since S.
thermophilus possessing prtS (prtS+) can acidify milk fast without the support of L. bulgaricus, prtS+
strains have a wide range of applications as industrial starters.
      Despite its growth advantage in milk, only a small number of prtS+ strains have been reported so far. For example, only 21 among 135 S.
thermophilus strains of the INRA historical collection were found to be prtS+ [9]. The first prtS+
strain was isolated from yogurt in Japan in 1971, and the second was isolated from fermented food in Mongolia in 1974 [7], suggesting the
possibility that prtS+ strains have been prevalent in East Asia. However, to the best of our knowledge, no studies on the isolation of prtS+ strains
from the environment have been carried out in these areas.
      The aim of the present study was to clarify the prevalence of prtS+ strains in Japan, an island country in East Asia, by isolating S. thermophilus
from raw milk collected from its 8 regions. Furthermore, we also measured the fermentation time and investigated the amino acid sequence of prtS in the isolated
prtS+ strains to evaluate the effect of prtS on acidification properties.

      MATERIALS AND METHODS

        Isolation of Streptococcus thermophilus
        Raw milk samples were collected from 8 regions of Japan (Fig. 1Fig. 1.Raw milk sampling areas in Japan. The 8 regions of Japan are differentiated by black lines, and each black dot (&#x2022;) represents a sampling location.) from 2011 to 2017, mainly from factories of Meiji Co., Ltd. (Tokyo, Japan). Collected samples were incubated at 48&#xB0;C for 24 hr under anaerobic conditions. Each sample was
diluted with sterile 0.85% (w/w) NaCl solution, and 0.1 mL aliquots were spread on milk agar plates containing 7% (w/w) skimmed milk powder (Meiji Co., Ltd., Tokyo, Japan), 1.9%
(w/w) &#x3B2;-glycerophosphate disodium salt (Cayman Chemical, Ann Arbor, MI, USA), and 1.5% Bacto Agar (Becton Dickinson and Company, Franklin Lakes, NJ, USA). &#x3B2;-glycerophosphate
disodium salt was added to prevent the growth of Lactobacillus species [10]. The plates were incubated anaerobically at 48&#xB0;C
for 24 hr. Obtained colonies were isolated by streaking on the abovementioned milk agar plates and incubated anaerobically at 48&#xB0;C for 24 hr. Colonies were gram stained, and
cocci-shaped gram-positive colonies were further incubated on BL agar plates (Nissui Pharmaceutical, Tokyo, Japan) anaerobically at 48&#xB0;C for 24 hr. DNA was extracted from each
colony using InstaGene Matrix (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA, USA) and identified as S. thermophilus by a BLAST search of 16S rDNA and phosphoserine phosphatase gene
(serB) sequences [11]. Then, RAPD (Random Amplification of Polymorphic DNA) PCR was carried out with strains isolated from
the same raw milk sample using the primers RAPD1 (5&#x2032;-CGTAAATTGC-3&#x2032;) and RAPD2 (5&#x2032;-CGTACATTGC-3&#x2032;) to remove genetically identical strains. The primers used in this study were
purchased from Eurofins Japan (Tokyo, Japan). The PCR reaction mixture was prepared as follows: 1 &#xB5;L genomic DNA from each isolated S. thermophilus strain was
mixed with 0.4 &#xB5;L of TaKaRa Ex Taq (Takara Bio, Kusatsu, Shiga, Japan), 2.5 &#xB5;L of 10&#xD7;Ex Taq buffer, 2 &#xB5;L of 2.5 mM dNTP, 0.4 &#xB5;L of 100 &#xB5;M primer, and 18.7 &#xB5;L distilled water. The
PCR reaction was performed using a Veriti Thermal Cycler (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA, USA) as follows: 4 cycles of 5 min at 94&#xB0;C, 5 min at 36&#xB0;C, and 5 min at 72&#xB0;C
followed by 30 cycles of 1 min at 94&#xB0;C, 1 min at 36&#xB0;C, and 2 min at 72&#xB0;C. Amplified products were then resolved by electrophoresis using 1% agarose L03 gel (Takara Bio, Kusatsu,
Shiga, Japan) containing 0.5 &#xB5;g/mL ethidium bromide (Nippon Gene, Tokyo, Japan) and visualized under UV light by ChemiDoc (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA, USA). Isolates with the same band
pattern were regarded as the same strain, and only isolates showing different band patterns were selected for further investigation.

        Analysis of prtS
        Primers used to check for possession of prtS and to sequence the entire coding region of prtS are listed in Table 1Table 1.Oligonucleotide primers used in this studyPrimer nameSequene (5&#xB4;-3&#xB4;)prtS-1FGACTTGAAGAAACAGCGCGTprtS-1RTAGGTGGAGGCGTTACAGTGprtS-2FAAGGACGGAGCCATCATGAAprtS-2RCGTCCAGTGATGACTTTCCTCprtS-3AGAAGAGGAGAAGCTTTCCGTprtS-4ATGTGACTGCAGCAATCGAGprtS-5TGGCGAGCTAAAACCAGACTprtS-6TAGCCGTTCTAGAAGAGCCGprtS-7GCAAGCGGTGTGACAACTATprtS-8GACTTGAAGAAACAGCGCGTprtS-9ATGACCAGGCAGTTGAAGCA. The primer set of prtS-1F and prtS-1R was used to amplify 684 bp inside prtS. The primer set of prtS-2F and prtS-2R was used to amplify the entire
coding region of prtS, and the primers prtS-3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, and 9 were used for sequencing. The PCR reaction mixture was prepared as follows: 0.5 &#xB5;L genomic DNA
from each isolated S. thermophilus strain was mixed with 0.1 &#xB5;L of Phusion High-Fidelity DNA Polymerase (New England Biolabs, Ipswich, MA, USA), 2 &#xB5;L of 5&#xD7;HF
buffer, 0.8 &#xB5;L of 2.5 mM dNTP, 1 &#xB5;L of 5 &#xB5;M each primer, and 4.6 &#xB5;L distilled water. The PCR reaction was performed using a Veriti Thermal Cycler (Thermo Fisher Scientific,
Waltham, MA, USA) as follows: 30 sec at 98&#xB0;C, followed by 30 cycles of 5 sec at 98&#xB0;C, 20 sec at 63&#xB0;C, and 3 min at 72&#xB0;C, and then finally 5 min at 72&#xB0;C. PCR products were resolved
by electrophoresis, and strains showing an amplification product of 684 bp by using the prtS-1F and prtS-1R primers were judged to be S. thermophilus possessing
prtS. For sequencing the entire coding region of prtS, PCR products were purified using ExoSAP-IT Express PCR Product Cleanup Reagent (Thermo
Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA, USA) and cycle sequenced by BigDye Terminator v1.1 Cycle Sequencing Kit (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA, USA) using the prtS-3 to 9 primers.
Cycle-sequenced products were sequenced using an ABI 3130xl Genetic Analyzer (Applied Biosystems, Foster, CA, USA) according to the manufacturer&#x2019;s instructions. Amino acid
sequences were predicted and aligned using the GENETYX ver.14 software (Genetyx, Tokyo, Japan) to identify mutations.

        Measurement of acidification properties of the isolated strains
        Each strain tested was anaerobically precultured twice at 37&#xB0;C for 18 hr in skimmed milk powder broth containing 10% skimmed milk powder (Meiji Co., Ltd., Tokyo, Japan) and 0.1%
yeast extract (Asahi Food and Healthcare, Tokyo, Japan) which was autoclaved at 121&#xB0;C for 7 min. The preculture was inoculated at 2% (w/w) in 10% skimmed milk powder broth and
incubated at 43&#xB0;C. When fermented under peptide-rich conditions, 0.2% Hyvital Casein CMA 500 (FrieslandCampina, Amersfoort, The Netherlands) was added to 10% skimmed milk powder
broth. During fermentation, pH was measured every 5 min using a multiple electrode measuring device (Horiba, Kyoto, Japan) with pH sensor SE 555 (Knick, Berlin, Germany). The time
needed for the pH to decline to 4.7 was defined as the fermentation time.

      RESULTS

        Isolation of S. thermophilus from raw milk in Japan
        From 2011 to 2017, we collected 313 raw milk samples from all regions of Japan, and a total of 172 colonies were identified as S. thermophilus. The number of
isolated strains and their isolated regions in each sampling year are summarized in Table 2Table 2.Number of S. thermophilus strains isolated from raw milkSampling yearNumbef of raw milk samplesNumber of isolated strains Total number of isolated strainsHokkaidoTohokuKantoChubuKinkiChugokuShikokuKyushu20119216162012884612311373720148971135802016367576328201781111Total3131091119912615172. We obtained at least 1 strain of S. thermophilus from each region in Japan and, of note, over 100 strains of S. thermophilus from
the Hokkaido region.

        Detection of the S. thermophilus strains possessing prtS
        To examine whether the 172 isolated S. thermophilus strains possessed prtS, extracted DNA from each strain was amplified by PCR using the prtS-1F
and prtS-1R primers. Among the 172 strains, 59 strains showed one amplification product of 684 bp, and the remaining 113 strains showed no products, indicating that 59 strains were
prtS+ and that 113 strains did not possess prtS (prtS-). The numbers and percentages of prtS+ strains isolated
from each region of Japan are summarized in Table 3Table 3.Number and percentage of prtS+ strainsRegionNumber of isolated strainsNumber of prtS+ strainsPercentage of prtS+Hokkaido1093128.4Tohoku11654.5Kanto19736.8Chubu9555.6Kinki100.0Chugoku2150.0Shikoku600.0Kyushu15960.0Total1725934.3. The total percentage of prtS+ strains among the 172 isolated S. thermophilus strains was 34.3%.

        Acidification properties of prtS+ strains
        To examine the acidification properties of the 59 prtS+ strains, the fermentation time at 43&#xB0;C in skimmed milk broth was measured. The number of
prtS+ strains showing each fermentation time is shown in Fig. 2Fig. 2.Number of prtS+ strains showing each fermentation time. The names of the 6 strains which needed over 10 hr to reach pH4.7 are described above the bars.. Fifty-three prtS+ strains showed fast acidification properties, reaching pH4.7 within 10 hr. However, 6 prtS+ strains (ME-722, ME-731,
ME-751, ME-761, ME-764, and ME-766) needed over 10 hr to reach pH4.7. We also measured the fermentation times of 11 prtS- strains isolated in this study and
confirmed that all strains needed over 10 hr to reach pH4.7 (data not shown). These results demonstrated that the majority of prtS+ strains in Japan were able to
acidify milk fast but that a few prtS+ strains showed slow acidification properties like prtS- strains.

        Sequencing of the prtS of slow acidifying prtS+ strains
        To investigate the factors affecting the slow acidification properties of the 6 prtS+ strains, amino acid sequences of PrtS were predicted using sequence data of
prtS and compared with those of two fast acidifying prtS+ strains, S. thermophilus LMD-9 and S. thermophilus
4F44 [12]. Amino acid sequences of the 6 prtS+ strains that differed from those of both LMD-9 and 4F44 are listed in Table 4Table 4.Mutation of PrtS amino acid sequences in slow acidifying prtS+ strainsSlow acidifying prtS+ strainsAccession No. of prtSDomainMutation typePredicted amino acid changeME-722LC514594HmisssenseThr1140Ile, Leu1189Ser, Asp1191Glu, Ile1211Val, Ala1232Thr, Glu1294Lys, Ala1342Thr, Tyr1380phe, Asn1424Gly, Val1475AlaWmisssenseIle1533Lys, Glu1548GlyANmisssenseLys1593Arg, Pro1598Leu, Ile1611LysME-731LC514595PPmisssenseLeu38Val, Ala53Val, Gly59AlaME-751LC514596PPmisssenseLeu38Val, Ala53Val, Gly59AlaPRframeshiftAla316Serfs*13ME-761LC514597PPframeshiftLeu26Phefs*12ME-764LC514598SSmisssenseVal19IleAframeshiftThr650Asnfs*41ME-766LC514599AmisssenseAsn937Asp, Asp944AsnAnonsenseTrp958*Predicted PrtS amino acid sequences of 6 slow acidifying prtS+ strains (accession Nos. are listed in the table) were compared with those of the PrtS of
S. thermophilus LMD-9 (accession No. ABJ66087) and 4F44 (accession No. ADB77872). Domain names are abbreviated as follows: PP: signal sequence; PR:
catalytic domain; A: globular domain; H: helical domain; W: wall domain; AN: anchored domain [8].. The presence of a stop codon was confirmed for 4 strains, 3 of which (ME-751, ME-761, and ME-764) had a frameshift mutation and 1 of which (ME-766) had a nonsense
mutation. The remaining 2 strains (ME-722 and ME-731) had several missense mutations. These results indicated that slow acidifying prtS+ strains had several
mutations in PrtS compared with fast acidifying prtS+ strains, which might result in the loss of protease activity of PrtS.

        Fermentation properties of slow acidifying prtS+ strains under milk peptide-rich conditions
        To verify the hypothesis that the amino acid mutations in PrtS of slow acidifying prtS+ strains resulted in the loss of protease activity and the lower
availability of peptides, the fermentation times of the 6 slow acidifying prtS+ strains were measured with the addition of casein peptide. As shown in Table 5Table 5.Fermentation times of prtS+ strains with or without casein peptideSlow acidifying prtS+ strainsFermentation time to pH4.7 No additionAddition of casein peptideME-722&gt;24 hr15 hr 50 minME-73116 hr 45 min12 hr 20 minME-75111 hr 55 min3 hr 45 minME-76114 hr 05 min3 hr 45 minME-764&gt;24 hr5 hr 15 minME-76617 hr 05 min9 hr 45 min, the fermentation times of all 6 strains were shortened by adding casein peptide to the medium. Of note, 4 strains (ME-751, ME-761, ME-764, and ME-766) finished
fermentation within 10 hr, showing acidification properties like fast acidifying prtS+ strains. However, two strains (ME-722 and ME-731) needed over 10 hr even
when casein peptide was added to the medium.

      DISCUSSION
      The main purpose of this study was to isolate and clarify the prevalence of prtS+ strains in Japan and to characterize the acidification properties of each
prtS+ strain. We isolated 172 S. thermophilus strains from 313 raw milk samples in Japan and revealed that 59 strains were prtS+.
Among the 59 prtS+ strains, 53 showed fast acidification properties, whereas the remaining 6 strains needed over 10 hr to finish fermentation. These results
demonstrated that prtS+ strains could be isolated from raw milk in Japan and that most of them had the ability to ferment milk fast without the support of other
proteolytic bacteria.
      The percentage of prtS+ strains isolated from 2011 to 2017 in this study was 34.3% (Table 3). This value is higher than
that in the INRA historical collection collected from 1956 to 2008 (15.6%) [9]. This is also higher than that in the report of Urshev et
al., who demonstrated that only 4 strains were prtS+ among 20 samples of homemade yogurt, 8 industrial starters, and 80 culture strains collected from
1970 to 1997 [13]. Nowadays, prtS+ strains are widely used as commercial starters for fermented foods such as yogurt and
cheese due to their fast acidification properties. To obtain fast acidifying prtS+ strains, Dandoy et al. proposed not only selection but also a
natural transformation method in which a 15 kb prtS genomic island is transferred to a prtS&#x2212; strain [14]. The
higher percentage of prtS+ strains in this study than in the previous reports could be attributed to the sampling years (2011&#x2013;2017), as selection and creation of
prtS+ strains for industrial starters would have been carried out after the first characterization of prtS+ strains in 1991 [6]. It is possible that selected or created prtS+ strains somehow made their way into the natural environment and have been increasing due to their
fast-growth properties. Moreover, it could be suggested that some prtS&#x2212; strains acquired the prtS genomic island from prtS+ strains
through naturally occurring horizontal gene transfer, since the prtS genomic island is flanked by two tandem sequences of IS elements [9]. Continuous isolation of S. thermophilus from the environment and examination for possession of the prtS gene would give us important
information about the spread of prtS+ strains.
      Although 53 prtS+ strains isolated in this study finished fermentation within 10 hr, the fermentation times varied among the strains (Fig. 2). Galia et al. reported that two strains with the same allele of prtS showed different acidification rates in milk
[12] and confirmed that the expression of prtS was higher in the fast acidifying strain than in the slow acidifying strain
[15]. They also reported that the expression levels of other genes known to be involved in carbon and nitrogen metabolism were also high in
the fast acidifying strain. It can thus be suggested that the variety of acidification properties among the 53 prtS+ strains originated from not only the sequence
variety of prtS but also differences at the transcriptional level of prtS and/or other genes involved in carbon and nitrogen metabolism. Though we
acquired prtS sequence data of slow acidifying prtS+ strains, analysis of fast acidifying prtS+ strains will be needed to
comprehend the differences in acidification properties among strains.
      Among the 59 prtS+ strains, 6 strains showed slow acidification properties and needed over 10 hr to finish fermentation (Fig.
2), and they had several amino acid mutations in PrtS (Table 4). The acidification properties were recovered by the addition of
casein peptides in the strains with a nonsense mutation (ME-751, ME-761, ME-764, and ME-766). Fernandez-Espla et al. demonstrated that PR (catalytic domain),
followed by A (globular domain), was the best conserved domain between PrtS and other cell-wall proteases of lactic acid bacteria [8]. All 4
strains with a nonsense mutation had a stop codon in PR or A, indicating that defects in these domains led to the dysfunction of PrtS. However, peptide addition was not so effective
for 2 strains with missense mutations (ME-722 and ME-731; Table 5). That is, strains with a nonsense mutation in PrtS resulted in lowered
protease activity, but strains with missense mutations in PrtS probably had another factor affecting the fermentation properties. One possible factor affecting the fermentation
properties of ME-722 and ME-731 might be functional defects in the peptide transporting process or peptide metabolizing process. Three oligopeptide-binding proteins involved in
transporting oligopeptide [16] and 15 different peptidase activities [17] were reported in S.
thermophilus, and these might affect the usage of an added peptide. Another possible explanation is that the metabolic pathways of other nutrients indispensable for growth
are impaired in ME-722 and ME-731. Derzelle et al. demonstrated that enzymes involved in the synthesis of purines as well as enzymes involved in the supply of amino
acids were upregulated in S. thermophilus grown in milk [18], which indicated that purines were also important nutrients for
growth. It might be possible that lowered acidification properties of ME-722 and ME-731 were caused by factors other than peptide utility, such as glycolysis or purine
metabolism.
      Delorme et al. hypothesized that S. thermophilus acquired the prtS genomic island by horizontal gene transfer from other
streptococcal strains [9]. It remains unclear how and when prtS+ strains in Japan acquired prtS and why some
strains lost the proteolytic function of PrtS by mutation despite the fact that it would result in weak growth. We conducted a phylogenetic analysis of obtained 172 S.
thermophilus strains by multilocus sequence analysis using 6 genes (ddlA, glcK, proA, ptsI,
serB, tkt) by referring to a previous report [19], but there were no cluster correlations with the sampling
area, possession of prtS, or sampling year (data not shown). We noticed that not only prtS&#x2212; but also prtS+ strains were isolated
together with proteolytic lactic acid bacteria such as Lactococcus lactis subsp. lactis and Lactobacillus helveticus, indicating
that peptide availability might not be the key factor for acquiring prtS. Bassi et al. reported another function of PrtS, that is, a function which
mediates the adhesion of S. thermophilus to surfaces conditioned by milk and the involvement in biofilm formation in the dairy environment [20]. To obtain deep insight into environmental conditions affecting gain or loss of prtS, further research will be necessary in the future.
      In conclusion, we demonstrated that fast acidifying S. thermophilus possessing prtS were prevalent in Japan. To the best of our knowledge, this is
the first report on the isolation of prtS+ strains from the environment in Japan. Since fast acidifying S. thermophilus strains can be used as
important industrial dairy starters, future work will be needed to examine detailed fermentation properties such as urease activity, production of EPS, and organic acids involved in
flavor.
