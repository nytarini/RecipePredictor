        The aim of this study was to investigate the effects of replacing vegetable fat at different concentrations (20, 30, 40 and 50%) by betaglucans from Ganoderma lucidum (&#x3B2;GGL), on the physical properties of cake batters, and on the quality of the resultant cakes. The addition of &#x3B2;GGL significantly affected the specific gravity, the flow properties and the color of the batter formulations. The fat-replacing led to a slight reduction in the volume of cakes, because fewer air bubbles were incorporated into the batter samples as the concentration of &#x3B2;GGL increased. The hardness of the cakes significantly increased during storage as the amount of &#x3B2;GGL increased. The fat-reduced cakes displayed similar color, moisture content, and water activity than the control cake samples. However, the crumb microstructure was affected by the addition of &#x3B2;GGL, as revealed by the scanning electron micrographs. The fat-reduced cakes containing 40% &#x3B2;GGL showed a general sensorial acceptance of 97%, as indicated by untrained panelists. These results suggest that &#x3B2;GGL could be used as fat replacers for improving the nutritional value of batter cakes.
