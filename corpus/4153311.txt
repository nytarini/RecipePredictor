    Monosodium glutamate (MSG) is a flavour enhancer that improves the savoury experience of
foods and is the prototypical chemical associated with the &#x2018;umami&#x2019; taste(
1
&#x2013;
3
). Because of its role as a flavour enhancer, it was initially believed that
MSG increased appetite and intake(
4
&#x2013;
11
). However, initial enhanced intake tends to decrease over
time(
8
,
12&#x2013;

14
) and recent research suggests that MSG may also delay hunger recovery in
the short term too, particularly when in combination with a food rich in
protein(
15
).
    So why might any appetite-enhancing effects of MSG be short-lived? One explanation is that
appetite is stimulated by MSG during the course of the meal (reducing satiation), but then
suppressed during the post-ingestive stage to delay later intake (enhancing satiety). This
suggestion is based on the idea that our ability to detect MSG evolved as a means of detecting
the presence of protein in foods(
1
) and regulating protein consumption(
16
,
17
). There is clear evidence that protein enhances satiety more effectively
than does either carbohydrate(
18
&#x2013;
20
) or fat(
21
,
22
) when delivered acutely as a preload(
23
,
24
) and longer term in the diet(
25
&#x2013;
27
). Recent data suggest that the satiating effects of protein are in part due
to the sensory characteristics of protein-rich foods acting to enhance post-ingestive
satiety(
28
), and umami could be one of the critical cues generating these
sensory&#x2013;nutrient interactions. Indeed, the umami taste has been linked to the satiating
effects of protein in infants(
29
,
30
) and may explain why intake of MSG meals over time remains stable despite
increases in palatability. A previous study assessing the time course of changes in rated
appetite over 120&#xA0;min after consumption of a fixed volume of soup (high-energy
carbohydrate-rich or protein-rich or low-energy control) with and without added MSG also
supports these findings. Hunger decreased less after MSG soup intake (consistent with the
stimulation of appetite through flavour enhancement), but hunger recovery was slower in the
MSG protein-rich condition compared with the no-MSG protein-rich condition which was not seen
for MSG in a low-energy or carbohydrate-rich context(
15
). However, another study has found no effect of MSG and protein on satiety
when measured at a test meal(
31
). This discrepancy might be due to the previous study(
15
) relying on measures of rated appetite at predefined time points whilst
other research has assessed intake at ad libitum test meal
sessions(
31
).
    Given this ambiguity in the literature about the role of MSG in appetite control, the present
research examined the effects of a soup preload differing in specific macronutrient ratios
(high-energy soups further enhanced with additional protein and carbohydrate contrasted with a
low-energy control) either with MSG added (MSG+) or no MSG (MSG&#x2013;) on appetite and intake at a
subsequent ad libitum meal. A preload meal interval of 45&#xA0;min was used as
this was found to be the optimum time for differences in hunger and fullness ratings between
MSG+ and MSG&#x2013; conditions in our recent study(
15
). Although MSG is not a nutritive substance, its potential influence on
satiation and satiety may modify the response to nutrients, particularly when in combination
with high ratios of a satiating nutrient such as protein. It was hypothesised that the
flavour-enhancing effects of MSG would mean less of a decrease in hunger when consuming a
fixed portion of the MSG+ versions regardless of nutrient content, but that hunger would
recover more slowly, and consequently that test-meal intake would be less in the protein-rich
than carbohydrate-rich preload conditions relative to the control, with MSG+ enhancing the
satiating effects of protein.

      Methods

        Design
        The study used a within-participant design to examine the effects of consumption of a
fixed soup preload differing in specific nutrient ratios/energy (high-energy
carbohydrate-rich or protein-rich or low-energy control) and MSG content (1 % (w/w) MSG
(MSG+) or no MSG (MSG&#x2013;)). Preload condition order was balanced using a Williams square
design(
32
).

        Participants
        A total of thirty-six low-restraint males initially participated in the research but one
participant failed to complete all sessions. The thirty-five remaining participants (mean
age: 21 (sd 0&#xB7;4) years, range 18&#x2013;28 years; mean BMI: 22 (sd 0&#xB7;5)
kg/m2, range 18&#x2013;33&#xA0;kg/m2) were students at the University of
Sussex. Sample size was determined from our earlier study(
15
) with effect size based on the maximal difference in rated hunger
between the protein preload with and without added MSG, indicating that thirty-six
participants would be required. Exclusion criteria included smoking, being on medications,
a history of diabetes, diagnosed eating disorders, allergies or dietary intolerances to
the foods used. Also, those with high restraint scores (ratings above 7 on the
Three-Factor Eating Questionnaire(
33
)) were excluded, as restrained individuals may not be representative of
general eating behaviour(
34
,
35
). Prospective participants were emailed with details of the study
disguised as &#x2018;assessing the effects of food on motor skills&#x2019; to minimise demand effects of
the experimental manipulation. Written informed consent was given before participation and
participants were paid &#xA3;60 on completion. The study was conducted in accordance with the
standards expressed in the Helsinki Declaration and was approved by the University of
Sussex ethics committee.

        Test food

          Control breakfast
          Breakfast on all test days consisted of 80&#xA0;g cereal (Crunchy Nut Cornflakes;
Kellogg's), 200&#xA0;g semi-skimmed milk (Sainsbury's plc) and 200&#xA0;g orange juice
(Sainsbury's plc) (total 2107&#xA0;kJ (503&#xB7;6 kcal)). These quantities were established based
on UK Food Standard Agency guidelines for male breakfast consumption(
36
).

          Soup preloads
          All flavour and energy manipulations used the same low-energy density (ED) control
soup, which was a carrot and spice soup containing carrots (Frozen Baby Carrots;
Sainsbury's plc), onions, celery, olive oil (Medium Flavour Olive Oil; Sainsbury's plc),
spice mixture (Garam Masala, Schwartz) and water (see Masic
&amp;Yeomans(
15
)). Portion size was fixed at 450&#xA0;g, as this has been established as
an adequate portion for males(
5
) and was successful in our previous study(
15
). Energy content was enhanced by the addition of 52&#xA0;g/450&#xA0;g portion
maltodextrin (dextrose equivalent: 15&#xB7;3; Cargill) in the carbohydrate soup and
17&#xB7;86&#xA0;g/450&#xA0;g maltodextrin (Cargill) combined with 36&#xA0;g/450&#xA0;g whey protein isolate
(MyProtein UK) to the protein soup. 1 % (w/w) MSG (Ajinomoto) was added to all MSG+ soup
conditions. Base soup formulation followed extensive pilot testing to formulate a novel
soup low in MSG, and which was rated as moderately pleasant to allow for enhancement by
MSG. Pilot testing was also carried out on the energy and macronutrient soup
combinations used (see Masic &amp;Yeomans(
15
)).
          The high-ED conditions contained approximately 750&#xA0;kJ (180 kcal) more per portion than
the low-ED condition (carbohydrate: 743&#xB7;7&#xA0;kJ (177&#xB7;5 kcal), protein: 771&#xB7;1&#xA0;kJ (184&#xB7;3
kcal)). The small energy difference between the high-ED carbohydrate and protein
conditions was due to efforts to minimise the impact of maltodextrin on sweetness in the
carbohydrate condition. All nutritional information can be found in Table 1.

          Ad libitum meal
          The two-course ad libitum lunch comprised of pasta in tomato sauce
followed by ice cream. Due to an unexpected change in formulation of the pasta sauce by
the manufacturer part way through the study, two versions of the meal had to be used but
each participant was only tested with one version. Both versions used 250&#xA0;g cooked pasta
(Conchiglie Pasta; Sainsbury's plc). This was combined with 250&#xA0;g of pasta sauce (Tomato
and Basil Sauce; Sainsbury's plc) for version 1, giving a 500&#xA0;g served portion (total
2273&#xB7;6&#xA0;kJ (543&#xB7;4 kcal)), but since the reformulated sauce had a higher energy density,
200&#xA0;g of sauce was used for version 2 to ensure a similar energy density across test
meals providing a 450&#xA0;g portion (total 2093&#xB7;7&#xA0;kJ (500&#xB7;4 kcal)). In all, fifteen
participants were tested with version 1 and twenty with version 2. Analyses of sensory
ratings and intake of the test meal depending on the served version found a significant
difference in rated saltiness between the two versions
(F(5,165)&#xA0;=&#xA0;2&#xB7;78; P&#xA0;=&#xA0;0&#xB7;02) but no other ratings
differed significantly, including pleasantness (F(5,165)&#xA0;=&#xA0;0&#xB7;73; NS).
Intake did not differ significantly between those consuming version 1 and version 2
(F(5,165)&#xA0;=&#xA0;0&#xB7;85; NS) and when test meal version was included as a
covariate, no differences in pasta meal intake was apparent (MSG&#xA0;&#xD7;&#xA0;test meal version:
F(1,33)&#xA0;=&#xA0;2&#xB7;57, NS; MSG&#xA0;&#xD7;&#xA0;condition&#xA0;&#xD7;&#xA0;test meal version:
F(2,66)&#xA0;=&#xA0;1&#xB7;34, NS). The served dessert was 150&#xA0;g of vanilla ice cream
(Carte D'Or; Unilever; total 1318&#xA0;kJ (315 kcal)).

        Computerised data collection
        Sensory, hedonic and appetite ratings were tracked using the Sussex Ingestion Pattern
Monitor (SIPM version 2&#xB7;0&#xB7;13; University of Sussex), which is comprised of a digital
balance linked to a computer. Participants were asked to complete appetite, sensory,
hedonic and mood ratings using digital visual analogue scales by the SIPM. All ratings
were presented as sentences (&#x2018;How &lt;word&gt; do you feel?&#x2019;) with a left-hand
anchor reading &#x2018;Not at all &lt;word&#xA0;&gt;&#xA0;&#x2019; (coded as 0) and a right-hand anchor
reading &#x2018;As &lt;word&gt; as I have ever felt/experienced&#x2019; (coded as 100).
Instructions on how to use the scale were presented to participants before each evaluation
to ensure compliance. Participants registered their selection by pressing &#x2018;Rating
Complete&#x2019;. Presentation order for each group of visual analogue scale ratings was
randomised.
        When participants were presented with the fixed preload or relevant course they completed
a taste test of the food (familiar, pleasant, salty, savoury, strong and sweet for the
preload, the same excluding sweetness for the pasta and excluding salty and savoury for
the dessert). Following this, appetite ratings of hunger, fullness and thirst after
tasting the relevant course and at the end of the course were completed. At the ad
libitum lunch participants were given a portion of the food with instructions
to &#x2018;Please eat as much (pasta/ice cream) as you like until you feel comfortably full&#x2019;.
Additional (refill) portions of the course being consumed were prompted by the SIPM with
an on-screen message and alert sound which instructed participants to call the
experimenter.

        Procedure
        The research took place over six non-consecutive sessions at the Ingestive Behaviour Unit
(IBU) at the University of Sussex. Participants were asked to consume nothing but water
from 23&#xB7;00 hours the night before each testing session and were provided with the control
breakfast at pre-arranged times (from 09&#xB7;00 hours to 10&#xB7;30 hours) across testing days.
Participants were free to leave the IBU after breakfast with instructions to consume
nothing but water and returned after 3&#xA0;h for the soup preload.
        For all consumption trials (preload and test meal) participants were first asked to
complete a bogus motor skills task (the star motor task, which consisted of tracing the
outline of a star with their non-dominant hand) in compliance with the cover story. Both
the preload (which ran from 12&#xB7;00 hours to 13&#xB7;30 hours) and main course sessions started
with mood and appetite ratings followed by serving of the relevant course. Taste test and
appetite ratings were completed after tasting each course (preload, main course and
dessert) with further appetite ratings when each course was completed. The test meal was
provided 45&#xA0;min after the soup as this was the time when differences in hunger were
maximal between the protein-rich preloads with and without added MSG(
15
). For the pasta course a portion of the pasta in sauce was served with
refills provided in 500&#xA0;g (or 450&#xA0;g) portions after approximately 450&#xA0;g (or 400&#xA0;g)
consumption whilst a portion of ice cream was served with additional 100&#xA0;g portions
provided after 100&#xA0;g ice cream consumption. This ensured that food was always present on
the plate to prevent normative external cues such as an empty plate from influencing meal
intake(
37
,
38
). The session ended after the final set of mood and appetite ratings. A
graphical representation is present in Fig. 1. At
the end of sessions 1&#x2013;5, participants were free to leave but their height and weight was
recorded and they were debriefed before payment on the final test day. Fig. 1.Graphical representation of the timings of the preload and ad
libitum meals and the appetite ratings made on each test day. &#x2193;, Appetite

        Data analysis
        Test meal intake (energy consumed) was contrasted using two-way 3&#xA0;&#xD7;&#xA0;2 repeated-measures
ANOVA with soup type (control, protein or carbohydrate) and MSG condition (MSG+ or MSG&#x2013;)
as variables. Intake was also analysed across the whole test meal and by individual
courses (savoury course and dessert) to determine whether preload conditions made an
impact on intake overall or differed by course. Additional analyses were conducted to
determine energy compensation (COMPX) at the test meal after high-energy (protein-rich or
carbohydrate-rich) preloads across MSG conditions (MSG+ or MSG&#x2013;). COMPX values were
calculated by subtracting test meal intake in the relevant control (low-energy) MSG+ or
MSG&#x2013; condition from the corresponding protein or carbohydrate (high-energy) MSG+ or MSG&#x2013;
condition and expressing this value as a percentage of the actual difference in soup
preload energy between low- and high-energy preloads (protein: 770&#xA0;kJ (184 kcal);
carbohydrate: 741&#xA0;kJ (177 kcal)). The resulting COMPX scores were contrasted using two-way
2&#xA0;&#xD7;&#xA0;2 repeated-measures ANOVA. To control for repeat testing, test order was included as a
factor in all analyses.
        Satiation analyses (pre-meal, post-taste and post-course) were conducted for each eating
episode over time using 3&#xA0;&#xD7;&#xA0;2&#xA0;&#xD7;&#xA0;3 repeated-measures ANOVA assessing appetite (hunger and
fullness) for the preload and separate 3&#xA0;&#xD7;&#xA0;2&#xA0;&#xD7;&#xA0;5 repeated-measures ANOVA assessing
appetite for the test meal due to the hypothesised effects of MSG increasing hunger during
the preload but maintaining satiety over the test meal duration. A separate 3&#xA0;&#xD7;&#xA0;2
repeated-measures ANOVA analysing the preload effects over 45&#xA0;min post-ingestion was also
carried out to assess the hypothesis of a slower return of hunger in protein-rich MSG+
conditions, as found previously(
15
). Hunger and fullness variables during preload satiation were
transformed to track the more subtle changes from baseline over the eating episode.
Sensory evaluations of the soup and test meal were analysed using repeated-measures
two-way 3&#xA0;&#xD7;&#xA0;2 ANOVA. In cases of violated sphericity, Greenhouse Geisser values (&#x3B5;&#xA0;&#x2264;&#xA0;0&#xB7;75)
were adopted. In cases of violated Greenhouse Geisser assumptions (&#x3B5;&#xA0;&#x2265;&#xA0;0&#xB7;75), Huynh&#x2013;Feldt
values were reported. Effect sizes are reported for specific effects using Pearson's
correlation coefficient. Data are shown for all thirty-five participants.

      Results

        Test meal intake
        As expected, energy intake at the test lunch varied between the three soup preloads
(F(1&#xB7;75,59&#xB7;55)&#xA0;=&#xA0;4&#xB7;58; P&#xA0;=&#xA0;0&#xB7;02) with significantly
less energy consumed after the protein-rich soup relative to control
(F(1,34)&#xA0;=&#xA0;7&#xB7;47, P&#xA0;=&#xA0;0&#xB7;01, r 0&#xB7;42;
Table 2). However, although there was a
tendency for lower energy consumption in MSG+ relative to MSG&#x2013; in both the protein-rich
and carbohydrate-rich, but not control, conditions (Table 2), these effects were not significant, nor did any effects of added MSG
emerge from analysis of the two courses of the meal separately. An order&#xA0;&#xD7;&#xA0;condition
interaction effect was found for intake of the savoury (F(10,58)&#xA0;=&#xA0;2&#xB7;41;
P&#xA0;=&#xA0;0&#xB7;02) and sweet (F(10,58)&#xA0;=&#xA0;2&#xB7;05;
P&#xA0;=&#xA0;0&#xB7;04) course, with inspection of the data across test sessions
suggesting that intake was highest in the first session after which consumption was
adjusted to the nutrients ingested in the preload. Table 2.Energy intake of an ad libitum meal after a soup preload

        Compensation for preload energy
        Overall energy compensation at the test meal was significantly better in the protein than
carbohydrate condition (F(1,34)&#xA0;=&#xA0;4&#xB7;19, P&#xA0;=&#xA0;0&#xB7;05,
r 0&#xB7;33; Fig. 2). Notably, the
small effects of added MSG on lunch intake translated into significantly better
compensation for added energy in the protein-rich soup, with 62 % compensation in the
protein MSG+ condition compared with only 24 % compensation in the carbohydrate MSG+
condition (F(1,34)&#xA0;=&#xA0;5&#xB7;45; P&#xA0;=&#xA0;0&#xB7;03; r
0&#xB7;37). This effect was largely driven by differences in savoury course intake
(F(1,34)&#xA0;=&#xA0;5&#xB7;63; P&#xA0;=&#xA0;0&#xB7;02; r 0&#xB7;38) with
51 % compensation in pasta intake in the MSG+ protein condition but only 16 % in the
carbohydrate MSG+ condition. No significant differences in compensation were found when
comparing carbohydrate and protein MSG&#x2013; conditions overall
(F(1,34)&#xA0;=&#xA0;1&#xB7;21; NS; r 0&#xB7;04). Fig. 2.Energy compensation at an ad libitum test meal (pasta main course

(MSG). Values are means, with standard errors represented by vertical bars.
a,b Mean values with unlike letters were significantly different
(P&#xA0;&#x2264;&#xA0;0&#xB7;05; within-subjects Bonferroni-corrected contrasts).

        Rated hunger and fullness during the preload and test meal

          Preload satiation and satiety
          There were no significant spurious differences in rated hunger
(F(2,68)&#xA0;=&#xA0;0&#xB7;06; NS) or fullness (F(2,68)&#xA0;=&#xA0;0&#xB7;68; NS)
before the soup was tasted. Thus, change from baseline hunger and fullness were analysed
to assess the influence of MSG manipulations when the soup was first tasted (assessing
the appetiser effect(
4
)) and immediately after consuming the soup preload (assessing effects
on satiation). A significant condition&#xA0;&#xD7;&#xA0;MSG interaction
(F(2,68)&#xA0;=&#xA0;4&#xB7;10; P&#xA0;=&#xA0;0&#xB7;02) in hunger ratings
immediately after tasting the soup indicated that hunger increased after tasting the
MSG+ control and carbohydrate soups but surprisingly decreased after tasting in the MSG+
protein condition whilst in the MSG&#x2013; conditions, hunger decreased after control and
carbohydrate conditions but increased after tasting the protein-rich soup
(F(1,34)&#xA0;=&#xA0;5&#xB7;70, P&#xA0;=&#xA0;0&#xB7;02, r 0&#xB7;38;
Table 3). No significant effects of soup
preload on hunger (F(2,68)&#xA0;=&#xA0;0&#xB7;31; NS) or fullness
(F(2,68)&#xA0;&#x2264;&#xA0;0&#xB7;001; NS) were found immediately after soup intake across
conditions, indicating that differences in nutrient content did not affect satiation.
Satiety analyses post-preload to pre-lunch revealed an increase in hunger
(F(1,34)&#xA0;=&#xA0;38&#xB7;30; P&#xA0;&#x2264;&#xA0;0&#xB7;001) and decrease in fullness
(F(1,34)&#xA0;=&#xA0;59&#xB7;55; P&#xA0;&#x2264;&#xA0;0&#xB7;001) over the 45&#xA0;min period
as expected. However, there was no effect of MSG and no MSG&#xA0;&#xD7;&#xA0;condition interaction on
hunger (MSG: F(1,34)&#xA0;=&#xA0;0&#xB7;87, NS; condition&#xA0;&#xD7;&#xA0;MSG interaction:
F(1&#xB7;7,57&#xB7;2)&#xA0;=&#xA0;0&#xB7;21, NS) or fullness (MSG: F(1,34)

contrast to what was found previously(

          Test meal satiation
          Changes in fullness and hunger during the test meal were examined separately to see
whether the nutrient and MSG preload manipulations modified the rate of satiation for
the test meal. Over the course of the test meal protein maintained increased satiety
(hunger: F(2,68)&#xA0;=&#xA0;15&#xB7;18, P&#xA0;&#x2264;&#xA0;0&#xB7;001; fullness:
F(2,68)&#xA0;=&#xA0;4&#xB7;01, P&#xA0;=&#xA0;0&#xB7;02) with a significant

        Sensory ratings of the preload and test meal
        There were no significant differences noted for familiarity

or sweetness (F(2,68)&#xA0;=&#xA0;2&#xB7;31; NS) across soup conditions; all soups were
deemed familiar, pleasant and marginally sweet (Table

P&#xA0;&#x2264;&#xA0;0&#xB7;001) and stronger tasting (F(1,34)&#xA0;=&#xA0;12&#xB7;57;

than MSG&#x2013; but MSG+ carbohydrate soups rated as less savoury than MSG&#x2013; conditions (Table 4). This may be due to the ambiguous nature of
the &#x2018;savoury&#x2019; label affecting sensory judgements as trained sensory panels were not
tested. The test lunch items were deemed equally familiar across conditions. There was a
significant difference in savoury course pleasantness (F(2,68)&#xA0;=&#xA0;5&#xB7;93;

protein preload consumption, followed by control and carbohydrate conditions. There were
no significant differences in sensory ratings across conditions for the dessert course.

      Discussion
      The main findings of the study indicate that nutrients received largely as protein in a
soup preload allow for an adequate adjustment of energy consumed at a later ad
libitum meal. Increasing the overall energy content of the test soup mainly with
added protein resulted in a greater reduction in lunch intake, and consequently more
accurate compensation for this added energy, than was seen when energy was increased by
addition of carbohydrate, in line with several recent studies(
23
,
39,

40
). Although the predicted enhancement of protein-induced satiety by the
addition of MSG was not significant based on intake data, the addition of MSG further
improved compensation for added protein energy. However, there were no differences between
MSG or specific macronutrient conditions in rated satiety over the course of testing after
preload intake.
      As predicted, test meal intake after consumption of the protein-enriched preload was lowest
followed by the carbohydrate and control conditions consistent with the broader literature,
suggesting that protein is more satiating than is carbohydrate(
18
&#x2013;
20
). Importantly, compensation became even more accurate when MSG was added
to the protein-rich compared with the carbohydrate-rich preload, with this effect strongest
in the savoury course of the test meal. This compensation effect was evident despite the
relatively small energy difference between low- and high-energy conditions. Indeed, in
previous studies compensation effects have only been apparent with larger energy differences
between preloads(
23
,
40,

41
). This suggests that moderate increases in the energy content of a food
through the addition of protein and MSG, for example as a savoury snack, may reduce the
likelihood of subsequent overconsumption.
      We suggest two possible explanations for how MSG may enhance compensation for energy added
as protein. First, the sensory quality generated by the addition of MSG may have made the
experience of protein more salient, and so enhanced the satiating effects of protein at the
test meal. This idea is supported by recent data showing no significant differences in
compensation at a test meal following high-protein and high-carbohydrate preloads when these
were matched for thickness and creaminess(
28
). Indeed, it may be that the characteristics of MSG are more strongly
associated with protein than are the sensory characteristics of thickness and creaminess
previously identified and thus act as a more reliable cue for protein-based satiety.
Alternatively, this improved compensation of protein in the MSG+ condition could be related
to post-ingestive stimulation of gut glutamate sensors(
15
,
42
) which have been related to enhanced satiety in animals(
43
&#x2013;
45
).
      An appetising effect(
4
,
46
) of MSG was seen in both the control and carbohydrate-rich soups with
added MSG but was not found in the equivalent protein-rich soup. This may be due to the
immediate sensory experience of protein and MSG eliciting lower feelings of hunger in the
protein-rich MSG+ condition; however, as ad libitum intake of the soup
course was not assessed, this remains as speculation. Despite the immediate stimulation of
appetite by added MSG in some conditions, no significant differences in hunger were seen
immediately after ingesting the soup, in contrast to our recent study(
15
). This may be related to volume and hedonic assessments, with
participants expecting each soup to be equally satiating due to the equivalent volumes
consumed(
47
). These predetermined portion sizes may then have influenced hedonic
hunger(
48
). No difference in appetite was also evident immediately before the
ad libitum meal 45&#xA0;min after preload ingestion and may be due to
participants responding in anticipation of the meal to be received(
49
). Hunger also remained stronger at the ad libitum meal
in added MSG control and carbohydrate-rich conditions but was suppressed in added MSG
protein-rich conditions. Such an effect may be indicative of delayed rebound
hunger(
40
), as participants consuming added MSG preloads without the accompanying
protein may have been anticipating stronger satiety due to the MSG protein cue. However, as
a large dose of protein was not delivered, hunger was not as satisfied at the end of the
test meal as when no protein cue was present (in no-MSG conditions). But when added MSG was
presented in combination with protein, the additional protein cue from MSG acted to reduce
feelings of hunger more strongly, suggesting that the added MSG may have increased the
salience of this cue as has been found previously(
15
) and is evident in infants experiencing umami taste in mother's
milk(
29
,
30
).
      The present study also noted that most of the effects of the preload manipulations on lunch
intake were evident for the first (savoury) course whereas intake at the dessert course was
not affected by preload type. This may be due to the high palatability of this course
overriding sensory and energy effects as has been found previously(
41
), as sweet appetite relies less on the experience of
hunger(
50
) and more on the hedonic effects of palatability(
51
,
52
). Thus consumption of a sweet course may be less suppressed by a
previously consumed savoury course(
53
), with the critical impact on behaviour being an earlier switch from
savoury to sweet courses. There were also a number of limitations in the present design that
constrained the conclusions drawn. Due to reformulations of the ad libitum
main course item, the different versions of the main course may have influenced test meal
intake. However, further analyses of intake taking this into account indicated that this was
most likely not the case. Similarly, effects of order on ad libitum intake
indicated that consumption was greater after the first test day but thereafter consumption
was in line with the nutrients ingested, indicating that these order effects should not have
influenced the sensory&#x2013;nutrient interactions reported. Initial power analyses indicated that
the sample tested would yield adequate power; however, although rated appetite and intake
were in the direction predicted they was not found to be significant. This may suggest that
a larger sample would be required to assess the more subtle effects of MSG on appetite. It
must also be noted that some research has claimed that there can be adverse effects for some
consumers when they ingest MSG(
54
) although double-blind studies suggest this may be more due to
expectation than actual effects of MSG(
55
,
56
). Further research is warranted to truly understand such findings in
human subjects.
      Overall, the addition of protein to a soup preload reduced subsequent intake and allowed
for more accurate energy compensation at a test meal and this was enhanced by the addition
of MSG. However, subjective satiety ratings were not influenced by MSG, the nutrients tested
or energy 45&#xA0;min after preload intake. Further research is required to understand the
influence of MSG and protein on sensory and gut responding as well as measures of appetite
hormones during and after intake of the preload conditions assessed to gain a more detailed
understanding of how sensory&#x2013;nutrient interactions influence rated appetite and subsequent
intake.
