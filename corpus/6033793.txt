        Tomato processing industry generates huge waste like tomato skin, seed, and pulp which creates environmental issues. Since tomato pomace contains bioactive compounds and pigments, present study was conducted to investigate the effect of tomato pomace addition on physicochemical characteristics and shelf-life stability of the developed bread and muffin. Refined flour was partially substituted with 35 and 40% tomato pomace in bread and muffin, respectively. Tomato pomace addition in bread and muffin was observed to significantly (p&#x2009;&lt;&#x2009;0.05) increase the dietary fiber, vitamin C, antioxidant activity and minerals (Na, K, Mg, Ca, Fe). The color parameters for bread and muffins were quantified in terms of L* (lightness), a* (redness/greenness) and b* (yellowness/blueness). There was an increase in a* and b*, while L* values decreased. Tomato based bread and muffin were found to possess softer texture as compared to control products. Microbial study has depicted the enhanced shelf-life of tomato based bread and muffin. Shelf life of preservative added tomato based bread was 8&#xA0;days and muffins were 12&#xA0;days. Tomato pomace could be a very useful commodity for incorporation into bread and muffin to have a complete nutritive food product.
