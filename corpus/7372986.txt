is the oldest method of preserving meat
and poultry; it is defined as the addition of salt with nitrite. Nitrite has a
microbiological preservative effect, particularly against Clostridium
botulinum, and it contributes to flavor, color properties, and
inhibition of lipid oxidation in cured meat products (Cassens, 1995; Pegg and Shahidi,
2000; Sindelar and Milkowski,
2011). Nitric oxide reduced from nitrite reacts with myoglobin to form
nitrosyl myoglobin, which is converted to a stable nitrosohemochrome during thermal
processing. However, although nitrite has many benefits, consumer demand for natural
products continues to grow because of perceptions and concerns for health risks
related to the consumption of nitrite in conventionally cured meat products (Sebranek et al., 2012). Thus, many meat
processors have attempted to develop and produce meat products cured with natural
ingredients that meet the needs of consumers by replacing synthetic nitrite with
natural ingredients containing nitrogen compounds, such as celery, spinach, lettuce,
and beets (Bedale et al., 2016; Jeong, 2016; Sebranek et al., 2012). In the food industry, there is now a
&#x201C;clean label&#x201D; trend, which refers to the production of foods without
the addition of harmful ingredients or additives or through &#x201C;natural&#x201D;
production methods, such as organic farming (Asioli
et al., 2017). Some consumers select clean label products that are
labeled as additive-free, preservative-free, natural or organic rather than products
with food additives on the product label, and there are increasing sales and
marketing of these clean label products (Lee,
2015).
      For an alternative meat curing method to replace synthetic nitrite, vegetables with a
high content of nitrate and starter cultures such as Staphylococcus
carnosus and Staphylococcus xylosus are commonly used
(Alahakoon et al., 2015; Li et al., 2013b; Sindelar and Houser, 2009). Currently, celery is the most
widely used as an alternative source of nitrate for curing meat products (Jeong, 2016; Sebranek and Bacus, 2007; Sindelar et
al., 2007a; Sindelar et al.,
2007b). In addition to celery, vegetables, such as spinach, lettuce, radish,
cabbage, and red beet, are known to contain considerable amounts of nitrate (Bahadoran et al., 2016; Siciliano et al., 1975; Tamme
et al., 2006; White, 1975).
Kimchi, which is a traditional Korean fermented food, is primarily manufactured
using Chinese cabbage and radish, which have high nitrate contents, and garlic,
ginger, green onion, and red pepper, which also contain some nitrates (Kim and Shin, 1997). Moreover, kimchi has been
recognized as containing bioactive substances, such as dietary fiber, minerals,
lactic acid bacteria, phenolic compounds, and vitamins, especially vitamin B,
ascorbic acid, and carotene. These substances are effective in preventing cancer,
antioxidant activity, and constipation (Levy,
1981; Park et al., 2014). For
these reasons, it is thought that kimchi has the potential to replace nitrite in
naturally cured meat products. Acerola, which is also called West Indian cherry or
Barbados cherry, has high contents of ascorbic acid and contains antioxidant
compounds, such as carotenoid and anthocyanin, which can be used as functional foods
(de Assis et al., 2001; de Rosso and Mercadante, 2005; Vendramini and Trugo, 2000). Reducing agents
such as sodium ascorbate and sodium erythorbate are commonly used in traditional
meat products to accelerate the rate of nitrite reduction to nitric oxide during
meat curing (Honikel, 2008; Sebranek et al., 2012). Thus, acerola is a good
candidate for replacing such cure accelerators in naturally curing meat because of
its high ascorbic acid content. Terns et al.
(2011) suggested that using cherry powder, with a high ascorbic acid
content, increased the reduction of nitrite to nitric oxide and rapidly decreased
the residual nitrite contents of indirectly cured, emulsified cooked sausages.
Moreover, because of the effects of nutrients, such as ascorbic acid and
polyphenols, in acerola powder, it can play crucial roles in suppressing the
formation of nitrosamines by reducing the residual nitrite content of cooked meat
(Neaud and Laroque, 2015). Lee et al. (2019) showed that kimchi extracts
have the potential to reduce color deterioration and lipid oxidation in ground pork
meat. In addition, Bae et al. (2019) reported
that nitrate ion in fermented kimchi ranged from 1,450 to 1,801 ppm after 1 wk of
fermentation. Kang et al. (2017) also found
that nitrate contents of 2,248.5 mg/kg were detected in commercially available white
kimchi in Korea. However, no information is available about using kimchi as a
natural source for nitrite in indirectly cured, processed meat products. Kimchi is
commonly prepared and fermented Chinese cabbage with varying seasonings including
salt, garlic, ginger, red pepper powder, and other ingredients. However, white
kimchi is produced without red pepper powder. Therefore, white kimchi was selected
in this study to eliminate the confounding effect caused by the red color of red
pepper itself and was dried to increase its nitrate concentrations. Therefore, this
study investigated the applicability of white kimchi powder and acerola powder as
sodium nitrite and sodium ascorbate replacements, and evaluated their effects in
naturally cured meat products by comparing them with conventionally cured products
and products cured with commercially available celery powder.

      Materials and Methods

        White kimchi and kimchi powder preparation
        Chinese cabbages and radishes grown in the five provinces of Korea (Gyeonggi-do,
Gyeongsang-do, Jeolla-do, Chungcheong-do, and Gangwon-do) were purchased,
randomly selected, and used as the main ingredients for the production of white
kimchi in this study. Moreover, Chinese cabbages, radishes, garlic, and ginger
were prepared by trimming, washing, shredding or cutting (Table 1). White kimchi was manufactured using a slight
modification of the standardized recipe for the Korean food (Institute of Traditional Korean Food,
2008). The Chinese cabbages were cut in half and solar salts were spread
on the cut side of them, and then, they were soaked in water for 6 h. After
soaking, the Chinese cabbages were rinsed under running water three to four
times, and the water was drained for 1 h using a strainer. The seasoning
ingredients (Table 1) were prepared and
added to the Chinese cabbages in containers, then, the pickling solution was
poured into the containers. After 2 wk of fermentation in a kimchi refrigerator
(K413SS13, LG Electronics, Changwon, Korea) at 0&#xB0;C, the liquid was
drained from the fermented white kimchi, and it was blended with a cutter (C6
VV, Sirman, Marsango, Italy). The ground white kimchi was vacuum-packed in
nylon/polyethylene bags of about 500 g each and stored in a deep freezer
(HKF-51, HFK, Wonju, Korea) at &#x2212;80&#xB0;C before freeze drying. After
opening the packages, the frozen white kimchi was dried at &#x2212;40&#xB0;C
in a vacuum freeze dryer (PVTFD10R, Ilshinbiobase, Yangju, Korea) for 2 d. The
dried white kimchi was pulverized with a blender (51BL30, Waring Commercial,
Torrington, CT, USA) for 3 min and then screened using a 30 mesh (Test sieve
BS0600, Chunggye Sieve, Gunpo, Korea). The white kimchi powder was vacuum-packed
in nylon/polyethylene bags and stored in a freezer at &#x2212;18&#xB0;C until
further use.

under running water, and then drained of water.

              2)
              Seasoning ingredients were prepared and added to the Chinese cabbages
after the cabbages were soaked.

              3)
              Pickling solution was poured onto Chinese cabbages containing
seasoning in containers, and the white kimchi was fermented for 2 wk
in a kimchi refrigerator at 0&#xB0;C.

        Preparation and processing of ground pork products
        Raw pork ham (M. biceps femoris, M.
semitendinosus, and M. semimembranosus)
muscles and back fat used in this study were obtained from a local meat
processor (Pukyung Pig Farmers Livestock, Kimhae, Korea) at 24&#x2013;48 h
postmortem. After trimming the intermuscular fat and visible connective tissues
from the fresh ham, the lean pork meat was cut into squares. The pork meat and
back fat (total batch size of 20 kg per trial in three trials) were sequentially
ground using a chopper (TC-22 Elegant plus, Tre Spade, Torino, Italy) with an 8
mm and 3 mm plate, respectively. Celery powder (SD00350002KL, Diana Food SAS,
Antrain, France), with a nitrate ion content of 16,889 ppm (equivalent to 23,151
ppm sodium nitrate), starter culture (CS 299, CHR Hansen, Milwaukee, WI, USA),
acerola juice powder (SD00030013LP, Diana Food SAS, Antrain, France), containing
a vitamin C content of 17.1%, sodium nitrite (S2252, Sigma-Aldrich, St.
Louis, MO, USA), and sodium ascorbate (#35268, Acros Organics, Geel, Belgium)
were purchased from commercial suppliers. Different amounts of white kimchi
powder, acerola juice powder, and starter culture were tested to investigate the
suitability of white kimchi powder and acerola juice powder as natural sources
for sodium nitrite/nitrate and sodium ascorbate for meat curing (Table 2). Ground pork meat and back fat
were randomly assigned to a control and five treatment batches. All batches
included 1.5% NaCl and 1.0% dextrose with the ground pork meat
mixture (70% pork, 15% fat, and 15% ice/water). The control
was prepared by adding 100 ppm sodium nitrite and 500 ppm sodium ascorbate. Five
treatments were produced, with different amounts of vegetable powder, acerola
juice powder, and starter culture (Table
2): the control, 0.01% sodium nitrite and 0.05% sodium
ascorbate; treatment 1, 0.2% white kimchi powder, 0.02% starter
culture, and 0.1% acerola juice powder; treatment 2, 0.2% white
kimchi powder, 0.02% starter culture, and 0.2% acerola juice
powder; treatment 3, 0.4% white kimchi powder, 0.04% starter
culture, and 0.1% acerola juice powder; treatment 4, 0.4% white
kimchi powder, 0.04% starter culture, and 0.2% acerola juice
powder; and treatment 5, 0.4% celery powder, 0.04% starter
culture, and 0.2% acerola juice powder. In treatment 5, the usage level
of celery powder was chosen based on the supplier&#x2019;s recommendation to
compare with the white kimchi powder treatments (treatments 1 to 4) because
celery juice and celery powder is commercially available and widely used as a
natural source of nitrate in processed meat products (Sebranek and Bacus, 2007). Moreover, phosphates were not
intentionally added to the samples because the use of phosphates in organic and
natural meat products is limited. To prepare the samples, ground pork meat and
back fat were added to a mixer (5K5SS, Whirlpool, St. Joseph, MI, USA) with NaCl
and sodium nitrite for a control, or NaCl and white kimchi powder or celery
powder for the indirectly cured treatments, and half of the ice/water, and this
was mixed for 5 min. After that, the meat mixtures were added with dextrose,
starter culture, acerola juice powder or sodium ascorbate, and the remaining
ice/water, and then, the mixture was mixed again for 5 min. The meat mixture
from each batch was stuffed into conical tubes in 50 g samples. The stuffed
tubes were then centrifuged at 2,000&#xD7;g for 10 min (Combi R515, Hanil
Science Industrial, Incheon, Korea) to remove any air pockets. After
centrifuging, all tubes were closed with caps and placed on racks. Control
samples were held at 10&#xB0;C for 1 h in a refrigerator (C110AHB, LG
Electronics, Changwon, Korea). Indirectly cured samples were incubated at
40&#xB0;C for 2 h in an incubator (C-IB4, Changshin Science, Pocheon, Korea).
When incubation was completed, all tubes, including the control and treatment
samples, were cooked to an internal temperature of 75&#xB0;C in a 90&#xB0;C
water bath (MaXturdy 45, Daihan Scientific, Wonju, Korea). The temperature was
monitored using a 4-channel digital thermometer (Tes-1384, Ketech Scientific
Instrument, Kaohsiung, Taiwan). After cooking, samples were immediately cooled
for 20 min on slurry ice and stored at 2&#xB0;C&#x2013;3&#xB0;C in the dark
before analyzing. Experiments were performed in triplicate.

        The pH values and cooking yield determination
        The pH of white kimchi powder and cooked meat products was measured using a pH
meter (Accumet AB150, Thermo Fisher Scientific, Singapore) following 5 g of
samples being blended with 45 mL of distilled water for 1 min in a homogenizer
(DI 25 basic, IKA&#xAE;-Werke GmbH &amp; Co. KG, Staufen,
Germany). The weight of each sample in the conical tube was measured prior to
cooking and then again after cooking and cooling to determine the cooking yield
using the following equation:

        CIE color measurements
        Color measurements were taken using a colorimeter (Chroma Meter CR-400,
illuminant C, 2&#xB0; standard observer; Konica Minolta Sensing, Osaka, Japan)
calibrated with a white plate (L* 94.90, a* &#x2013;0.39, b* 3.88). The
Commission Internationale de l&#x2019;Eclairage (CIE) L* (lightness), a*
(redness), and b* values (yellowness) system was used to determine the color of
freshly cut surfaces of each cooked sample immediately after cutting.

        Nitrate and nitrite analysis
        The contents of nitrate ion (NO3&#x2212;) and nitrite ion
(NO2&#x2212;) of white kimchi powder were determined
by the zinc reduction method described by Merino
(2009). Results were reported as parts per million (ppm). The
residual nitrite content in cooked meat products was analyzed according to the
procedure of AOAC (2016). A calibration
curve was prepared using sodium nitrite (S2252, Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO,
USA), and the residual nitrite content was reported as parts per million
(ppm).

        Nitrosyl hemochrome, total pigment, and cure efficiency determination
        Nitrosyl hemochrome and total pigment was determined using a method described by
Hornsey (1956). For nitrosyl
hemochrome determination, 10 g of each cooked sample was blended with 40 mL
acetone and 3 mL distilled, deionized water using a homogenizer (DI 25 basic,
Kinematica AG, Luzern, Switzerland). The samples were kept in the dark for 15
min and filtered through a Whatman No. 1 filter paper, and then, absorbance of
the filtrate at 540 nm (A540) was determined using a
spectrophotometer (UV-1800, Shimadzu, Kyoto, Japan). The nitrosyl hemochrome
concentration (ppm) was calculated as A540&#xD7;290. For the total
pigment measurement, 10 g of each cooked sample was blended with 40 mL acetone,

        Thiobarbituric acid reactive substances (TBARS) determination
        Malondialdehydes (MDA) was measured by 2-thiobarbituric acid reactive substances
(TBARS) values using a distillation method reported by Tarladgis et al. (1960) to determine lipid oxidation. The
TBARS values were reported as mg MDA per kg of cooked samples.

        Statistical analysis
        All experiments were performed in triplicate. Data were statistically analyzed as
a randomized block design with six treatments (control and five treatments)
using the GLM (general linear model) procedure of the SAS program (SAS, 2012). If significance was determined
(p&lt;0.05) in the model, the significance of the means was further
separated by Duncan's multiple range test.

      Results and Discussion

        The physicochemical properties of prepared white kimchi powder
        The white kimchi powder prepared for meat product processing had a pH of 6.33 and
moisture content of 5.37%. In the prepared white kimchi powder, the
nitrate ion content was 16,778 ppm (equivalent to 22,999 ppm sodium nitrate),
nitrite ion content was 0.72 ppm (equivalent to 1.08 ppm sodium nitrite), and
salinity was 27.25%. In preliminary experiments, fermented white kimchi
had nitrate ion contents of 1,247 ppm, nitrite ion contents of 0.31 ppm, and
salinity of 2.07%, suggesting that these components in its powder form
were concentrated following the drying process.

        pH values, cooking yield, and CIE color values
        The indirectly cured products (treatments 1 to 5) had lower pH values
(p&lt;0.05) than the control produced with sodium nitrite and sodium
ascorbate (Table 3). As the addition
levels of acerola juice powder increased in treatments 2 and 4 of the indirectly
cured products, the pH values of the meat products decreased (p&lt;0.05).
This result was probably affected by the lower pH (3.33) of acerola juice
powder. This is in agreement with Xi et al.
(2012), who have reported similar findings of the pH values of
naturally cured frankfurters decreasing as concentrations of cranberry powder,
with a pH of 2.2, were increased. Interestingly, treatment 5 containing celery
powder had lower pH values (p&lt;0.05) than the control and the treatments
with white kimchi powder, except for treatment 2. This result indicates that
celery powder, with a pH 5.07, had an effect on relatively lowering the pH of
treatment 5, compared with the white kimchi powder, with a pH of 6.33. The
cooking yields of the indirectly cured meat products followed the same trends as
the pH results of this study (Table 3).
The control samples had higher (p&lt;0.05) cooking yields compared with the
indirectly cured treatments with white kimchi powder or celery powder. For the
products containing white kimchi powder, treatments 2 and 4 with 0.2%
acerola juice powder had lower cooking yields (p&lt;0.05) than treatments 1
and 3, with 0.1% acerola juice powder. These results are slightly in
contrast to those of Lee et al. (2008),
who reported that incorporating kimchi powder at either 1% or 2%
into breakfast sausages produced significantly higher cooking yields than the
control without kimchi powder. However, unexpectedly, it seems that the effect
of acerola powder on decreasing the pH value and cooking yields of naturally
cured meats was very strong, compared with the conventionally cured meat
products (control). These results are probably a result of phosphate not being
added to the indirectly cured treatments in this study. Sebranek and Bacus (2007) indicated that the addition of
curing accelerators, such as vinegar, lemon powder, and cherry powder, has the
potential to accelerate nitrite reactions in natural or organic meat products.
However, it has been suggested that lowering the pH of these products can result
in the reduction of moisture retention because phosphates and some water binders
cannot be used for them (Sebranek and Bacus,
2007). Consequently, there is a need for a supplementary approach to
increase water binding, which is one of the essential functions of phosphates in
cured meat products. Compared with the products with celery powder (treatment
5), the products with white kimchi powder (treatments 1 to 4) showed higher
(p&lt;0.05) cooking yields (Table 3).
In this study, the cooking yields of treatment 5 (83.46%) were lower than
those reported by Cropp (2018) in bologna
sausages containing celery and cherry powder (91.6%). These results may
be related to differences in product formulations and the celery powder used.
For CIE L* values, the five treatments were not significantly different
(p&gt;0.05) from the control (Table
3). Similarly, Sindelar et al.
(2007b) reported that the addition of celery juice powder to ham,
regardless of the addition level and incubation time, did not significantly
change (p&gt;0.05) the CIE L* values compared with those from the sodium
nitrite control. In this study, the CIE a* values ranged from 10.59 to 10.73,
and no differences were found (p&gt;0.05) between the control and all five
treatments (Table 3), suggesting that the
addition levels of nitrate from white kimchi powder or celery powder have been
shown to be sufficient for developing the cured color of final products. Terns et al. (2011) obtained similar
results for indirectly cured emulsified sausages. These results suggest that
although only a small amount of white kimchi powder and acerola juice powder was
added to treatments 1 and 3, they produced similar effects (p&gt;0.05) on
redness to the control and the other treatments. Therefore, the white kimchi
powder prepared for this study could have the potential to substitute synthetic
nitrite or commercial celery powder as a nitrate source for producing organic
meat products. However, all treatments containing the vegetable powders had
higher CIE b* values (p&lt;0.05) than the control (Table 3), but no difference in CIE b* values (p&gt;0.05)
were found among products with the white kimchi powder or celery powder
(treatments 1 to 5). Similarly, Krause et al.
(2011) found that hams with vegetable juice powder and starter
culture were more yellow (higher b* values) than the control cured with sodium
nitrite. This is most likely because plant-derived powders include plant
pigments (Horsch et al., 2014).

        Residual nitrite, nitrosyl hemochrome, total pigments, cure efficiency, and
TBARS
        The residual nitrite contents were highest (p&lt;0.05) in the control (21.65
ppm) and decreased by 78.4% of the added amount during product
manufacturing (Table 4). This depletion
is higher than the findings of ~65% for dry-cured sausages (Li et al., 2013a) and ~75% for
frankfurters (Xi et al., 2012). The
reduction of residual nitrite is affected by factors, such as the type of raw
meat, pH of the meat, initial nitrite content, cooking temperature, and reducing
agents (Cassens et al., 1978; Honikel, 2008; Xi et al., 2011). Among naturally cured products, when
comparing treatments with the same amount of acerola powder, treatments 4 and 5
had higher residual nitrite contents (p&lt;0.05) than other treatments
(Table 4). It is possible that higher
natural nitrate from vegetable powder along with the starter culture,
Staphylococcus carnosus, which has nitrate reductase
activity, resulted in more reduction of nitrate to nitrite in the meat curing
system. However, as the amount of acerola juice powder increased, the residual
nitrite contents decreased (p&lt;0.05) in treatments 2, 4, and 5. Acerola is
recognized as having high ascorbic acid, which has been found to be a curing
accelerator that helps the conversion of nitrite to nitric oxide, and therefore
is responsible for the faster development of the cured meat color (Sebranek et al., 2012). Gabaza et al. (2013) reported that ascorbic
acid provides reducing conditions that increase the rate of nitric oxide
formation, which accelerates the reduction of residual nitrite content. Sullivan et al. (2012a) and Terns et al. (2011) also found that the
addition of cherry powder, which has high ascorbic acid content, reduces the
residual nitrite content by increasing the reduction rate of nitrite to nitric
oxide in indirectly cured sausages and hams. Thus, the lower residual nitrite of
treatments 2, 4, and 5 could be related to the lower pH and ascorbic acid levels
from the acerola powder added in this study, which was consequently available
for the reduction of nitrite to nitric oxide. This explanation supports the
findings for the nitrosyl hemochrome and total pigment contents (Table 4). The nitrosyl hemochrome and total
pigment contents were higher (p&lt;0.05) in treatments 2, 4, and 5 with
0.2% acerola juice powder than in the control and treatments 1 and 3
containing 0.1% acerola juice powder, regardless of the amounts of white
kimchi or celery powder. These results suggest that cured color could rapidly
develop through the addition of acerola juice powder as a source of ascorbic
acid. Since pH and reductants are known to be the most important factors that
influence nitrite reactions during meat curing (Sebranek, 2009). Especially, the pH can offer the basis for
formulating acidulants to accelerate this process (Fox, 1974; Soltanizadeh and
Kadivar, 2012). According to Fox et
al. (1967) and Sebranek
(1979), a small decrease in pH in the meat curing system can be quite
important, and a pH decrease of 0.2 units can lead to double the rate of cured
color formation because of nitrite&#x2013;myoglobin interaction. The pH
differences between treatments 2, 4, and 5 and the control and treatments 1 and
3 were about 0.16&#x2013;0.39 pH units. Therefore, these pH differences might
explain why treatments 2, 4, and 5 showed lower residual nitrite contents, but
higher nitrosyl hemochrome and total pigment contents compared with the other
treatments. However, cure efficiency was higher (p&lt;0.05) in the
indirectly cured treatments (treatments 1 to 5) than the control (Table 4). Treatment 2 had a higher
(p&lt;0.05) cure efficiency than the control and treatments 1 and 3, but it
was not significantly different (p&gt;0.05) from treatments 4 and 5.
Interestingly, in treatment 2, kimchi powder, celery powder, and starter culture
were added in half the concentrations of treatments 4 and 5, and acerola juice
powder was added in equal concentrations. Such high cure efficiencies are
thought to indicate the possibility that, coupled with acerola juice powder,
prepared white kimchi powder is a very effective substitute for nitrite in an
indirectly cured meat system. Other studies have also found high cure
efficiencies for naturally cured meats. Sullivan
et al. (2012b) found higher cure efficiencies for commercially
available naturally cured brands of frankfurters, hams, and bacons collected
from retail establishments, which were also redder as the cured pigments had
increased. However, these trends on a relationship between redness and cured
pigments were different from those observed in this study, which could have
resulted from differences in nitrite/nitrate content derived from natural
sources. Moreover, Shin et al. (2017)
reported that cure efficiency was more than 80% when pork patties added
with 2% pre-converted nitrite from Swiss chard powder, which was
significantly higher compared with those produced with 2% pre-converted
nitrite from celery powder. Treatments manufactured with white kimchi powder or
celery powder had higher TBARS values (p&lt;0.05) than the control with
sodium nitrite (Table 4), and no
differences (p&gt;0.05) were observed in the TBARS values among the
naturally cured products. Lower TBARS values in the control were expected to be
due to higher residual nitrite contents in this study because nitrite
contributes to antioxidant effects (Pegg and
Shahidi, 2000). Although the addition of vegetable powders was
expected to inhibit lipid oxidation because kimchi, celery, and acerola contain
natural antioxidants, such as several polyphenols, flavonoids, and carotenoids,
as well as high ascorbic acid content (Kooti and
Daraei, 2017; Lee et al.,
2019; Rufino et al., 2010; Woo and Jeong, 2006), this effect against
lipid oxidation did not occur. A possible explanation for the higher TBARS
values in the treatments with vegetable powder appears to be the effect of the
lower pH values. Yasosky et al. (1984)
found that the TBARS values of ground pork increased as pH values decreased.
Kim et al. (2019) reported similar
results for meat products cured with spinach and starter culture and found that
pH values decreased with the addition of 10% spinach extract, whereas the
TBARS values increased. Besides this, the TBARS values in this study were less
than 0.15 mg MDA/kg, which was lower than the 0.5&#x2013;1.0 mg MDA/kg suggested
by Tarladgis et al. (1960) as a threshold
range for detecting off-odor in cooked pork.

      Conclusion
      Although there was a detrimental effect on the cooking yield due to the lowered pH
from the acerola juice powder added to replace sodium ascorbate, there was no
difference in the redness of cured color development when compared with the sodium
nitrite-added control. Furthermore, meat products indirectly cured with white kimchi
powder or celery powder showed higher nitrosyl hemochrome and cure efficiency than
the control. When 0.2% acerola juice powder was added, cooked products with
white kimchi powder (0.2% or 0.4%) had a similar color and cured
pigment qualities than those with 0.4% celery powder which is commercially
available as a source of natural nitrate. Therefore, this study indicates that white
kimchi powder has substantial potential to replace synthetic nitrite for naturally
cured meat products and suggests that when a reductant with a low pH, such as
acerola juice powder, is used for curing reactions with vegetable powder in clean
label products, supplementary ingredients with buffering capacity for pH are
required. In addition, further studies are warranted to reduce lipid oxidation in
naturally cured meat products. The findings of this study indicate that the use of
white kimchi powder in the production of indirectly cured meats could provide a
product that is desirable for consumers who favor clean label products.
