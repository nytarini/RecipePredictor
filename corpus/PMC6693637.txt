We have previously shown that maternal cow’s milk (CM)
elimination results in down-regulation of CM-specific IgA antibody levels in
BM, but not in serum, suggesting that an entero-mammary link may exist for
food-specific antibody-secreting cells.

Objective
We sought to investigate whether food-specific IgA epitope profiles
differ intra-individually between mother’s serum and BM. We also
examined how infants’ food epitope-specific IgA develops in early
infancy and the relationship of IgA epitope recognition with development of
cow’s milk allergy (CMA).

Methods
We measured specific IgA to a series of overlapping peptides in major
CM allergens (αs1-, αs2 -, β-
and κ-caseins and β-lactoglobulin) in paired maternal and
infant serum as well as BM samples in 31 mother-infant dyads within the
first 15 postpartum months utilizing peptide microarray.

Results
There was significant discordance in epitope specificity between BM
and maternal sera ranging from only 13% of sample pairs sharing at
least one epitope in αs1-casein to 73% in
κ-casein. Epitope-specific IgA was detectable in infants’
sera starting at less than 3 months of age. Sera of mothers with a CMA
infant had increased binding of epitope-specific IgA to CM proteins compared
to those with a non-CMA infant.

Conclusion &amp; Clinical Relevance
These findings support the concept that mother’s milk has a
distinct anti-food antibody repertoire when compared to the antibody
repertoire of the peripheral blood. Increased binding of serum
epitope-specific IgA to CM in mothers of infants with CMA may reflect
inherited systemic immunogenicity of CM proteins in these families, although
specific IgA in breast milk was not proportionally upregulated.


   INTRODUCTION
Through the transfer of maternal antibodies, breast milk (BM) presents a
unique opportunity to educate the developing infant mucosal immune system(1). Therefore, these BM-derived antibodies may
have significant implications for the transfer of protection provided against
mucosal pathogens as shown for postnatal mother-to-infant transfer of HIV(2) and possibly against immune-mediated diseases
such as allergies. We have previously shown that high levels of BM total and
specific IgA are associated with protection against cow’s milk allergy (CMA)
(3), which is typically the first sign of
breach in development of oral tolerance. Understanding the origins and the
specificity of BM IgA may provide guidance on ways to enhance the protective
properties of BM.

IgA in serum is mainly monomeric (mIgA), whereas in mucosal fluid, polymeric
IgA is predominant. Mucosal IgA antibodies are produced by plasma cells in the
lamina propria and are transported across epithelial cells by the polymeric
immunoglobulin receptor (pIgR)(4). At apical
site, IgA is released as two mIgA molecules linked by the J chain peptide and the
extracellular ligand binding portion of pIgR, called the secretory component. BM is
a rich source of secretory IgA (SIgA) with lesser amounts of SIgG and SIgM (5). Milk IgA is produced by mammary gland B
cells that have migrated from the mother’s intestine via the
“enteromammary link” (6, 7). This is suggested by animal studies, in
which B cells from Peyer’s patches and mesenteric lymph nodes were shown to
migrate specifically to the lactating mammary gland (8–11). This is controlled
by hormones antepartum(12), and by the
mucosal vascular addressin MadCAM-1, which interacts with the gut homing receptor
α4β7 integrin (13) and mucosa-associated CCL28/CCR10 link (14). Consistent with this, in a rabbit model
oral and inhaled RSV resulted in RSV-IgA production in milk, bronchial and enteral
secretions, whereas systemic immunization did not.(15) Studies in women in late pregnancy (16) showed an increase in plasma cells in milk, but not in saliva or
serum, specific to the non-pathogenic E. coli strain used for oral
immunization. Thereby the antibody specificity of BM reflects the antigenic
stimulation encountered e.g. by the maternal gut. Antibodies in breast milk may also
partly originate from the systemic compartment as suggested by high levels of
dimeric IgA detected in breast milk after systemic passive immunization with broadly
neutralizing HIV antibodies (17). For
food-specific IgA, the presence of an enteromammary link was suggested by our
previous work, which showed that a strict maternal diet eliminating CM was
associated with lower levels of CM-specific IgA in BM than a regular diet containing
CM (3). This implies that the food antigenic
stimulation encountered by the maternal gut acutely directs the antibody specificity
of BM, similar to what has been shown to be the case for IgA responses to microbes
that are constantly modified to reflect the microbiota present in the gut
lumen.(18)

Pioneering work has suggested that IgA production is associated with oral
tolerance (19) and transient IgA deficiency
in infancy seen in serum and saliva has been documented in atopy (20–23). In
CMA, low serum IgA levels to β-lactoglobulin at diagnosis have been shown to
be associated with persistence of CMA (24).
Increases in serum specific IgA and IgA2 have been associated with
development of natural tolerance in egg allergy (23). Antigen-specific serum IgA has been shown to increase in
subcutaneous immunotherapy with aeroallergens (25), in oral immunotherapy (OIT) to egg (26) and in successful CM OIT(27).
Simultaneously, CM allergen binding by serum IgA has been shown to increase over
time in persisting CMA (28). There is some
evidence to suggest that IgA2 may reflect changes in local environments
as indicated by increases in TGF-β from nasal biopsies that correlate with
serum IgA2 levels and by salivary specific IgA that has been shown to be
induced with peanut sublingual immunotherapy.(29) Interestingly, serum IgA may play a role in preventing food-induced
reactions, as seen in mouse models of egg allergy,(30) and in vitro experiments of IgE blocking
activity.(31)

In light of the relative delay in maturation of the total IgA levels in early
childhood, and the possible importance of serum IgA in infants prone to developing
food allergy, we were interested in how infants’ epitope-specific IgA
develops in early infancy. We also investigated whether food-specific IgA epitope
profiles differ intra-individually between mother’s serum and BM, which
would suggest different homing of food-specific antibody-secreting cells (ASC) to
systemic and mammary immune compartments. Our clinical material consisted of banked
mothers’ and infants’ sera and BM samples from dyads recruited for
an allergy birth cohort.

METHODS
Subjects
We utilized stored BM and paired maternal and infant serum samples from
a prospective birth cohort, designed to assess the development of the infant
immune system and association between immunologic factors in human milk and
development of food allergies in breastfed infants. Results for total and
CM-specific IgA in BM of this cohort have been previously published.(32) (3) In brief, mothers volunteered to the study and were recruited
before or shortly after birth from two different populations of differing risk
for food allergy: 1) those who were atopic themselves by report and/or had a
child with food allergy diagnosed by elimination and open food challenge or
other allergic diseases assessed by the investigator (KMJ), and 2) those who had
no atopic diseases or first-degree relatives with atopic diseases. They were
followed prospectively with clinical follow-up visits occurring at 0–2
weeks, 1, 3, 6, 12 and 18 months to assess for any signs or symptoms suggestive
of food allergies. Infants from two groups of differing risks for atopy were
recruited: those with an increased risk of food allergy defined either as
presence of an older sibling with food allergy and those with low risk as
defined by having only non-atopic first degree relatives. Overall, 24 of the
mother-infant pairs were in the group with increased risk of food allergy and 7
in the group with low risk. All infants were born full-term and had no other
chronic diseases. They had diets appropriate for their age. A total of 31
mother-infant pairs had matched infant and maternal serum and milk samples
available. In a given mother, BM and serum samples used in the analysis were
collected at the same time point, between 5 days and 5 months of lactation (mean
54, IQR 31–67.5 days). Paired infant serum samples were collected
between 1 and 18 months of age and the earliest available sample was used for
the analyses (mean 8.5, IQR 4.2–12.6 months). During the follow-up, 9
infants developed IgE-mediated CMA as evidenced by presence of CM-specific IgE
by skin prick testing and/or serum-specific IgE and an immediate-type reaction
(hives, maculopapular rash, swelling, vomiting, and abdominal pain) during an
open CM challenge, and 7 developed non-IgE-mediated CMA, diagnosed by
delayed-type reactions (eczema exacerbation, diarrhea) during CM challenge and
lack of CM-specific IgE. Fifteen infants did not develop CMA.

The initial cohort study was approved by the ethics committees of the
Skin and Allergy Hospital of the Helsinki University Central Hospital and the
City of Helsinki. Written informed consent was obtained from the mothers.
Internal Review Board of the Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai, New York,
NY (HS# 11-01838) approved the use of clinical data and stored and
frozen historical samples for the additional antibody assays.

Samples
BM and serum samples were collected on each clinical follow-up visit if
possible. BM samples were collected in the morning and processed immediately.
Samples were centrifuged (400 g, 15 min), fat was removed, and supernatant
collected, frozen and stored at −80°C. After thawing, samples
were centrifuged at 17 000 g, 10 min at 4°C and the fatty layer was
removed. The samples from mothers who had mastitis during the preceding 4 weeks
were excluded. The serum samples were collected by venipuncture, frozen, and
stored at −80°C.

Measurement of epitope-specific IgA antibodies
Samples were analyzed using a peptide microarray of
αs1-, αs2- β- and
κ-casein and β-lactoglobulin, which are the most common CM
allergens. Each protein represented as a set of 20 amino acid peptides with
offset of 3 amino acids (i.e. overlapping by 17 amino acids) covering the entire
polypeptide (50–65 peptides/protein). IgA binding was detected using
fluor-labeled anti-IgA and quantitated by a microarray scanner. Background
binding was measured from blank spots. Raw fluorescence intensity from three
replicate spots was converted to a Z-score as previously described.(33) Briefly, a Z- score is defined as IgA
binding measured in relation to background binding: (sample intensity –
median blank intensity) divided by median absolute deviation of blank intensity.
In addition to individual peptides Z-scores, total Z-score for a protein is
expressed as a sum of all peptide Z-scores for that protein. Data for the same
CM antigen epitopes for specific serum IgE, IgG4 and IgA have been previously
published (24, 34).

Statistical analysis
Statistical comparison of immunoglobulin levels was by a Wilcoxon rank
sum test for two groups or by a Kruskal-Wallis test for three groups.
Nonparametric methods were used because of non-normality of the measurements.
Statistical significance for contingency tables was assessed using chi-square
tests (or Fisher’s exact test if any cell had less than five counts). On
the box plots the median is represented by a horizontal line within the box
representing the 25th to 75th percentile, and whiskers
show the 5th to 95th percentile.

For comparisons between individuals and between groups, peptide Z-scores
≥3 were considered significant. Each individual sample was filtered for
noise and spurious binding by rejecting Z-scores that did not have a neighboring
signal that was also significant. Statistical significance testing was performed
using R software version 3.2.3 (35).

For comparing epitope recognition between paired BM and mothers’
serum samples, peptide series were grouped to epitopes by calculating Jaccard
distance between each pair of neighboring peptides, and grouping together
peptides with a distance &lt; 0.4. An epitope was then determined to be positive
for binding if any of its constituent peptides were positive (See Table 3). Binding agreement between paired samples
was then assessed using Cohen’s Kappa for inter-rater agreement, with
the two sample types, mother’s milk and serum representing raters.
Cohen’s Kappa measures agreement between two categorical variables
emphasizing agreement beyond that obtained by random chance. It’s values
range between 1 and −1 such that 1 indicates perfect agreement between
the two raters, 0 indicates agreement that is no better than what would be
achieved by random chance, and negative values indicate exclusivity.

RESULTS
IgA to κ, α s2- and β-casein are present
in the majority of BM and serum samples
When IgA response to each protein was measured as a sum of its
individual peptides, κ-casein was the most immunogenic CM protein
followed by αs2- and β-casein. These proteins
elicited IgA responses in 90% of the BM samples and
61–77% of the infant and maternal serum samples (Table 1). In contrast, β-lactoglobulin and
αs1-casein induced specific IgA responses in only
13–19% of the infant serum samples and in about 30% of
mothers’ serum and BM samples (Table
1). In general, BM samples had IgA antibodies to the most numerous CM
proteins and infant serum had IgA to the least numerous CM proteins. However, up
to 87% of infant sera had IgA against at least one CM protein.

The same IgA-binding epitopes are generally immunogenic in BM,
mothers’ and infants’ sera
IgA binding areas in most CM proteins coincided between BM and serum
samples, although β-lactoglobulin had distinct patterns of recognition
that varied between BM and serum (Fig. 1).
This distinction was most noticeable in recognition of β-lactoglobulin
epitopes 1 and 3 that were only recognized by milk samples but not by serum
samples (8/1/1 and 5/1/1 positive in milk only/serum only/both, respectively)
(Fig 2 and Table S1). On the contrary, epitope
2 on β-lactoglobulin was predominantly recognized by serum samples, and
only by a small number of BM samples (2/6/1 positive in milk only/serum
only/both).

IgA specificity is distinct between paired samples of mother’s milk
and serum and infant’s serum
Because the same epitopes were generally immunogenic between BM and sera
in the whole cohort, we were next interested in comparing epitope recognition
patterns within a mother infant-pair. When IgA peptide binding profiles were
compared between mother’s milk and serum, it was noted that there was
significant discordance. Although some epitopes were recognized by IgA
antibodies in the same individual’s milk and serum samples, many were
bound by BM IgA or by mother’s serum IgA but not by both (Fig. 2, Table S1). The percentage of
mothers with both milk and serum IgA recognizing the same epitope varied
depending on the protein, ranging from 13% in
αs1-casein to 73% in κ-casein (Table 2). The most immunogenic epitopes in α
s1-, β- and κ-casein, epitopes 8, 10, 15 and 18
were recognized by IgA in both mother’s BM and serum (kappa
0.23–0.43, see table
S1), whereas most epitopes were recognized by BM or serum IgA, but
not both (kappa &lt; 0.2).

IgA-binding epitopes in mothers’ and infants’ sera were
also discordant (Fig
S1b) as were epitopes between breast milk and infant serum (Fig S1c). Only a minority
of epitopes were recognized by both infant’s and mother’s sera
within the dyad.

Infants who develop CMA have mothers with elevated serum CM-specific IgA
binding
In the next step, we sought to assess the impact of the infant’s
age on the production of CM allergen-specific IgA in all three sample types
(Fig. 3). We noted that in infant sera,
IgA reactivity was present even in the earliest (1 month) samples, and varied
throughout the entire range of ages with no significant correlation with age
(data not shown). Stratifying the data by infants’ future CMA status did
not affect the distribution or age correlation of composite IgA score (data not
shown). We did not detect a statistically significant difference in specific IgA
levels between dyads in infants with IgE-mediated and non-IgE-mediated CMA and
thus data from all CMA were treated as one group. There was no significant
correlation between infant’s age and IgA reactivity in BM or
mother’s serum (data not shown). However, we noticed that IgA from sera
of mothers with a CMA infant appeared to have more IgA epitope binding.

We then compared Z-score sums for individual proteins between mothers
with an infant that develops CMA and those that did not (Fig. 4) and noted that mothers with CMA infants had
significantly elevated levels of IgA to all of the CM proteins (p &lt; 0.05). No
difference was seen in their BM or infant serum CM-epitope-specific IgA levels
between CMA and non-CMA dyads.

DISCUSSION
In the present study we have shown that epitope specificity of BM IgA
significantly differed from that of the paired maternal serum for each assessed CM
allergen. This suggests that distinct pools of food-specific IgA ASCs home to
mucosal and systemic immune systems. It is possible that these mammary gland ASCs
represent B cells that originate in the gut, similar to what has been described for
the entero-mammary link of pathogen-specific IgA ASCs (13). This could be further assessed by comparing IgA
epitope-specificity in BM to that of the salivary IgA from the sublingual
compartment, which has recently been suggested as a novel noninvasive proxy for
intestinal immune induction.(36)
Alternatively, this could result from distinct epitopes being presented to mucosal
and systemic T and B cells. We also found that epitope-specific IgA was detectable
in infants’ sera as early as 3 months of age. Lastly, sera of mothers with a
CMA infant had increased binding of epitope-specific IgA to CM proteins compared to
those with a non-CMA infant.

In serum, there is a relative delay in the development of total IgA seen
until about 2 years of life, and there is a dramatic increase in the number of
peripheral blood CD27+IgA+ memory B cells, consistent with T
cell-dependent development within the first 18 months of life (37). In the current study, we showed that
epitope-specific IgA was detectable in infants’ sera starting at a
relatively young age of less than 3 months. Plasma cells producing IgA are only
generated after birth to provide SIgA to the lumen and therefore infants’
mucosal IgA production is considered compromised at least for the first month of
life (38–40). Normally, Peyer’s patch, mesenteric lymph
node and mucosal lamina propria B-cells convert IgM to IgA via class switch
recombination (CSR).(41) Two pathways for
producing IgA, T-cell dependent (TD) and T-cell independent (TI) pathways, both
utilize plasma B-cell CSR but involve different upstream factors.(38) Therefore, delayed TI responses may contribute to the
delayed induction of intestinal IgA during early infancy. Given breast milk IgA does
not cross the infant gut barrier, the early serum specific IgA production reflects
the infant’s own mucosal production of IgA to antigens such as cow’s
milk, which are among the first foreign proteins introduced to the infant gut. We
did not have samples to assess the development of mucosal IgA, nor did we have
samples prior to one month of age to assess when epitope-specific IgA responses were
initially seen.

Interestingly, we also show that mothers of CMA infants had significantly
increased binding of serum IgA, but not breast milk IgA specific to CM epitopes,
compared to mothers with a non-CMA infant. However, utilizing conventional ELISA, we
and others have shown that milk from mothers of CMA infants have lower levels of
total and CM-specific IgA than those with healthy infants. The significant
difference between these methods is that ELISA detects both sequential and
conformational epitopes (32, 42) whereas the current method detects sequential
epitopes only. In our previous study, we found that maternal diets eliminating CM
are associated with lower specific IgA levels in BM.(3) In light of the findings of the current study, another possibility is
that the low BM IgA production is due to an inability to produce mucosal IgA
antibodies, with simultaneous upregulation of systemic antibody responses. Although
the mothers in the present study were tolerating CM, their systemic IgA responses
were increased similarly to what has been reported in persistent CMA (28). Because avoidance of CM was seen in most
mothers with CMA infants, the present study was too small in number to dissect out
at the epitope level whether low BM IgA in mothers with a CMA infant is due to an
inability to produce mucosal IgA or due to lack of stimulation by CM exposure.
Nevertheless, strategies to increase production of mucosal (breast milk) IgA
production may aid in prevention of food allergies.

Other limitations of the study include limited amounts of infant serum
available to examine production of other immunoglobulin classes, including
IgA1 vs predominantly mucosally-derived IgA2, as well as
systemically prevalent IgG, which would have been of interest. Furthermore, we
investigated IgA binding only to linear, not conformational epitopes, which
certainly play a major role in CMA (43). The
strengths include the access to paired mother-infant samples at a young age, prior
to the development of established CMA.

The function of BM IgA antibodies is not completely understood.(44, 45)
By reinforcing the epithelial barrier, SIgA inhibits inappropriate immune activation
by microorganisms and antigens in the lumen of the intestinal and respiratory
tracts.(46) This immune exclusion could
mediate tolerance by providing protection against excessive and uncontrolled antigen
influx. Our previous data using cell culture transcytosis assays support the view
that BM plays a role in immune exclusion preventing excess antigen uptake in
enterocytes.(3) Alternatively, BM
antibodies could favor focused antigen uptake, e.g. via M cells as immune complexes,
which could target the antigen for presentation favoring tolerance development. This
is suggested by studies of Rey and Corthesy (47) who showed that SIgA was targeted to Peyer’s patch dendritic
and T cells after transport by intestinal M cells, via a so-far unknown IgA receptor
as described by Mantis.(48) This possibility
is supported by our findings of facilitated peanut uptake to Peyer’s patches
in the presence of peanut-specific antibodies in mice.(49) Lastly, it is known that BM antibodies play a role in
gut homeostasis by shaping the gut microbiota.(50)

In summary, we show that the mammary gland IgA antibody repertoire to CM
proteins is distinct from the systemic immune compartment, which may be due to
specific homing of mucosa-associated ASCs to mammary glands. Mothers who have an
infant with CMA show increased systemic immunogenicity with CM proteins as denoted
by epitope-specific IgA in their serum but not in their BM, which may play a role in
development of CMA. The regulation of the BM IgA repertoire and levels of antibodies
are an important part of the mucosal immune system in the mammary gland, and may
have implications to the specific immune imprinting of the infant’s immune
system by BM. Strategies to increase mucosal (breast milk) IgA production may aid in
prevention of food allergies.
