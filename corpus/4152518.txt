        Edible coatings can extend the shelf-life of many foods, controlling moisture and solute migration, gas exchange and oxidative reaction rates. Besides, edible coatings can be used as carriers of bioactive compounds to improve the quality of food products such as antioxidants, antimicrobials, flavors and probiotics. These approaches can be useful to extend shelf-life as well as provide a functional product. When edible coatings are used as a matrix holding bioactive compounds remarkable benefits arise; off odors and flavors can be masked, bioactive compounds are protected from the environment, and controlled release is allowed. In this sense, the present review will be focused on analyzing the potential use of encapsulation with edible coatings to incorporate bioactive compounds, solving the disadvantages of direct application.
