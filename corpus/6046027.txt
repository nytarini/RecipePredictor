Jaggery (Gur) is a natural sweetener made by concentration of sugarcane juice, contains all minerals and vitamins present in sugarcane juice. In order to utilise jaggery in place of sugar, muffins were prepared by replacing 84% sugar with 42, 63 and 84% jaggery. Different levels of eggs namely 42, 63 and 84% were also tried for jaggery muffins. The results showed that muffins prepared with 84% each of jaggery and eggs had acceptable quality characteristics. Effect of jaggery in comparison with sugar on the pasting characteristics of wheat flour, physico-sensory and storage characteristics of muffins were studied. Addition of jaggery and sugar increased pasting temperature and peak viscosity. Higher increase in pasting temperature with jaggery and in peak viscosity with sugar were observed indicating differential influence on pasting characteristics of wheat flour. The muffins with jaggery had lower pH, overall quality score and higher aw than muffins with sugar. During 21&#xA0;days storage period, pH and aw decreased and titratable acidity increased for both the muffins. Even though the muffins with jaggery were less soft, showed lower overall quality score than the muffins with sugar, muffins with jaggery were acceptable and both the muffins were found to be microbiologically safe, as shown by the microbial load (total mesophilic count and yeast and mold count) in the range of 66&#x2013;89&#xA0;CFU/g. Hence, it can be concluded that it is possible to replace sugar with jaggery in muffins without affecting the properties of the product.
