        A major corn-related mycotoxin, fumonisin B1 (FB1), continues to attract
attention of researchers as well as risk-assessors due to the diverse
toxicological characteristics, including distinct target tissues in different
animal species and opposite susceptibility in males and females in mice and
rats. More than thirty years passed since the structure identification as a
sphingoid-like chemical, but the causal mechanism of the toxicity remains
obscure in spites of extensive studies. Considerable amounts of knowledge have
been accumulated on the biochemical/toxicological actions of FB1, but the
influence on lipid dynamics and mobilization in the body has not been focused
well in relation to the FB1-mediated toxicity. Considerable influences of this
toxin on mobilization of sphingolipids and phospholipids and also on adaptive
changes in their compositions in tissues are implicated from recent studies on
FB1-interacting ceramide synthases. Accumulated patho-physiological data also
suggest a possible role of hepatic phospholipid on FB1-mediated toxicity. Thus,
a mechanism of FB1-mediated toxicity is discussed in relation to the
mobilization of phospholipids and sphingolipids in the body in this context.
