ons typically have higher intakes of
added sugars relative to white and economically advantaged groups.1 Public housing residents are a low-income group&#x2014;approximately 1.1 million US households2&#x2014;and recent analyses have demonstrated that minorities are overrepresented in
this population&#x2014;45% are African American.3 Public housing residents&#x2019; diets often do not meet recommendations for
limitations on added sugar.4,5
The American Heart Association (AHA) recommends that adults limit their added sugar
intake to 6 to 9 teaspoons (tsp) per day.6 In one study, the median added sugar intake among predominantly African
American public housing residents in Baltimore, Maryland, was over 21 teaspoons per day.5 A survey of public housing residents in Montgomery County, Maryland, reported
58% drank at least 1 sugar-sweetened beverage (SSB) daily.4
      Health disparities have been previously documented for public housing
residents.7,8
For example, obesity is pervasive among adults living in public housing, where the
prevalence is over 50%7 relative to a third of US adults during a similar period.9 During the &#x201C;Moving to Opportunities&#x201D; (MTO) project, public housing residents
were randomized to receive a voucher to move to a higher income neighborhood. The
MTO 10-year outcomes suggested that residents randomized to receive this voucher had
reduced prevalence of class II/III obesity and type 2 diabetes mellitus as compared
with residents without this opportunity.7 These results suggest that living in low-income neighborhoods confers an
increased risk of chronic disease to public housing residents. The mechanisms
contributing to this risk are likely multifactorial; however, social networks&#x2014;the
connections among people within a community&#x2014;might have a role.
      An ecologic framework hypothesizes that the environment&#x2014;including social networks&#x2014;may
influence diet and weight status.10 An individual&#x2019;s social networks may modify dietary behaviors through social
influence, such as social norms and behavior modeling.11 The AHA deemed social networks to be potentially powerful interventions and
has encouraged networks research focused on cardiovascular disease.12 Prior research suggests a link between social networks and obesity.13 Some studies have examined diet and social networks&#x2014;Dietary intake is
correlated among family members (Feunekes, 1998).14,15,36 In our prior research among
African American public housing residents, residents suggested that networks of
family and neighbors could support behavior changes to improve diet.15 We also found a significant relationship between residents&#x2019; added sugar
intake and exposure to SSB consumption within their social network.5
      Given our prior results, we designed and tested a social network&#x2013;oriented behavior
change intervention to decrease added sugar intake among overweight, adult public
housing residents by encouraging reduced SSB consumption in a feasibility study. We
hypothesized that a social network intervention would be feasible and decrease added
sugar intake. A comprehensive framing of feasibility has identified 8 areas of focus
for feasibility studies.16 Considering this framework, our feasibility outcomes included acceptability,
implementation, and limited-efficacy testing on added sugar intake using a
previously validated assessment. Secondarily, we also explored whether (1)
participants changed their intake of specific food items high in added sugar, and
(2) the intervention decreased perceived SSB intake among public housing residents&#x2019;
social network members broadly.

      Methods

        Study design
        We conducted a 6-month nonrandomized trial of a network-oriented intervention to
reduce SSB consumption&#x2014;Sugar Champ&#x2014;in 2 public housing developments in
Baltimore, Maryland (NCT02138240). We considered SSBs to include both regular
soda that included sugar and fruit-flavored drinks with added sugar (ie, sports
drinks, Tampico, Sunny D, Kool-Aid, Hi-C, cranberry cocktail, Twister). As this
was a feasibility study, we elected a single-arm design given preliminary nature
of the work. The Johns Hopkins School of Medicine Institutional Review Board
approved all study protocols.

        Intervention development
        Recent meta-analyses found that interventions to reduce SSB consumption produced
significant decreases among children and adolescents, but no significant effects
among adults.17 Interventions that aim to reduce adult SSB consumption may therefore need
to employ additional methods beyond individual-level behavior change strategies.
A meta-analysis found that social network interventions promote and sustain
behavior change,18 and network interventions may be an efficient strategy as intervening on
one individual might produce behavior change among a group.19 In addition, our prior research supported a high added sugar intake among
public housing residents, as well as demonstrated significant associations
between added sugar intake and consumption of high added sugar foods (ie, SSB
and sweets) among social network members.5,15
Supplemental Figure 1 displays a timeline of intervention
development activities.
        We created a preliminary version of a small-group curriculum by combining (1)
behavior change techniques to reduce added sugar intake with (2) a theory-based
peer outreach approach to engage the social network. To promote reduction in
added sugars, we used behavior change techniques employed by the Diabetes
Prevention Program (DPP) and adapted DPP modules for the Sugar Champ curriculum.
The DPP&#x2019;s key features include a goal-based behavioral intervention delivered by
lifestyle coaches,20 and uses behavioral techniques including goal setting, problem-solving,
self-monitoring, and social support. Sugar Champ content included
self-monitoring of added sugar by tracking total intake daily, devising
strategies to reduce added sugar intake, as well as understanding food cues and
strategies to stay motivated to limit added sugar intake.
        To promote peer outreach, we modified a theory-based network intervention to
prevent HIV&#x2014;Self-Help in Eliminating Life-Threatening Diseases
(SHIELD).21,22 The SHIELD intervention is based on social cognitive
theory, social identity theory, cognitive dissonance theory, and social
influence theory. In brief, SHIELD trained individuals at high risk for HIV to
be &#x201C;Peer Educators&#x201D; who shared information and risk reduction strategies with
other individuals in their social network also at high risk for HIV. As a Peer
Educator, participants learned risk reduction information and skills. They also
learned communication skills to prepare them for peer outreach. While peer
outreach is often done with the community at-large or with strangers, the peer
outreach in the SHIELD program was focused on people in their social network&#x2014;the
group of people who the Peer Educator knows well or feels very comfortable with,
such as drug or sex partners, family, friends, and support group members. Peer
Educators were trained in a small-group setting where structured intervention
sessions focus on communication and risk reduction, and every session includes
training activities such as role-play and problem-solving. The SHIELD approach
is effective at increasing safe sex practices and decreasing high HIV-risk drug behaviors.21 In Sugar Champ, we similarly trained public housing residents as Peer
Educators by applying the same principles and strategies used in SHIELD. Our
content included describing the health risks associated with diets high in added
sugar intake, training on communication skills through education and role-play,
and problem-solving. All sessions included a focus on developing Peer Educator
communication and counseling skills, which then Peer Educators used with their
social network members.
        Next, we conducted a series of 3 focus groups with public housing residents from
2 communities to understand demand for and acceptability of the curriculum to
reduce added sugar intake. Demand determines the extent that the intervention is
likely to be used, and acceptability determines to what extent the intervention
is suitable to participants.16 The first group presented the results of our cross-sectional survey and
assessed demand for a program to reduce added sugars in the community. In the
subsequent 2 groups, residents were tasked with implementing a specific aspect
of the intervention in between groups (eg, calculating their added sugar intake
each day) and returned the following week to share the acceptability of their
experience and provide suggestions for improvement. In the third group, we also
obtained feedback regarding information that might increase demand for the
program. A detailed description of the focus group methods is in Supplemental Materials 1 and moderator guides are in Supplemental Materials 2. Based on these groups, we revised the
proposed Sugar Champ intervention in several ways. First, residents had
difficulty attempting to track total added sugar intake daily. They recommended
focusing just on reducing SSB, which they identified as a primary source of
added sugars in their community. The numeracy and mathematic skills required to
track added sugars presented a particular challenge for many residents, so we
developed a simplified method to track SSB intake that relied on circling
pictograms (Supplemental Materials 3). Second, many residents had less
knowledge about the health risks of added sugars relative to other nutrients
such as sodium, and residents were unsure whether reducing added sugar intake
should be a priority for the community based on information regarding health
risks alone. We shared information regarding the evidence of how advertising
practices have targeted their communities with unhealthy foods.23,24 Residents
felt that this information was key to share during the intervention, as it
created a sense of priority and empowerment for them to reduce added sugar
intake.
        The final Sugar Champ curriculum included a total of 9 group sessions
(60-90&#x2009;minutes)&#x2014;6 core sessions delivered weekly for 6&#x2009;weeks, then 3 booster
sessions delivered every other week for an additional 6&#x2009;weeks (total
intervention duration 3&#x2009;months). Table 1 describes the learning
objectives, and lists the module origin and behavior change techniques employed
based on a previously described taxonomy.25 Peer Educators received a $300 gift card to compensate them for their
time in training. A master&#x2019;s-level interventionist was trained to deliver this
curriculum to Peer Educators. Our Peer Educators communicated information and
shared skills learned during the group sessions with their social network
members. Peer Educators were encouraged to share information and skills with
their network members, although 1 specific network member participated in the
study with them (termed as their &#x201C;Sidekick&#x201D;). Peer Educators and their Sidekicks
worked to reduce SSB together. Sidekicks received no information or training
from the research team&#x2014;Any intervention content they received was from their
Peer Educator. Sidekicks only interacted with the study team during recruitment
and data collection.

        Recruitment, eligibility criteria, and data collection
        We recruited public housing residents to become Peer Educators by mailing
invitations to all residences in 2 public housing developments in Baltimore,
Maryland. We followed up these mailings with door-knocking attempts. We then
screened potential participants for eligibility. The study took place between
March and September 2017.
        To be eligible, we required that potential Peer Educators live in 1 of the 2
public housing developments, be at least 18&#x2009;years old, and be English-speaking,
consume SSB at least twice a day. Given the excess burden of overweight/obesity
among public housing residents and the health consequences of this condition, we
required Peer Educators to have a body mass index (BMI) in the overweight range
(&#x2A7E;25&#x2009;kg/m2). In addition, Peer Educators had to recruit one of
their social network members to participate in the study as their Sidekick; they
had to have in-person contact with the Sidekick at least once during the past
month. Potential Peer Educators were given an informational letter to share with
potential Sidekicks, which directed the Sidekick to call the research team to
determine their eligibility. Eligibility criteria for Sidekicks were
age&#x2009;&#x2A7E;&#x2009;18&#x2009;years, English-speaking, and consume SSB at least twice a day. We did
not require Sidekicks to live in public housing, as we found that residents&#x2019;
networks often extend outside their neighborhood in our prior studies in this population.5 We excluded individuals who had health conditions for which dietary
change or weight loss is contraindicated, such as pregnancy, recent myocardial
infarction, or cancer.
        We collected data from Peer Educators and Sidekicks during visits to the Peer
Educators&#x2019; homes at baseline and 6&#x2009;months, and all participants received a $50
gift card as compensation for data collection at these time points. We used
software to facilitate data collection (EgoNet, MDLogix).

        Primary outcomes
        Our primary outcomes included acceptability, implementation, and limited-efficacy
testing of the Sugar Champ intervention based on previously defined elements of
a comprehensive framing of feasibility.16
        Acceptability determines to what extent the intervention is suitable to participants16 and can include assessments of satisfaction and intention to refer
others. We assessed these elements at 6&#x2009;months. We asked all participants
&#x201C;Overall, how satisfied were you with the Sugar Champ program?&#x201D; (very satisfied,
somewhat satisfied, somewhat dissatisfied, very dissatisfied) and &#x201C;How likely
would you be to recommend to a friend that they participate in the Sugar Champ
program?&#x201D; (very likely, somewhat likely, somewhat unlikely, very unlikely).
Among Peer Educators, we asked &#x201C;How satisfied were you with the training that
you received as a Sugar Champ Peer Educator?&#x201D; (very satisfied, somewhat
satisfied, somewhat dissatisfied, very dissatisfied).
        Implementation determines the extent that the intervention can be successfully
delivered to participants16 and can include degree of execution. We examined Peer Educator attendance
at group sessions, the percentage of Peer Educators attending at least 6 of the
9 group sessions, and study retention for 6-month data collection among all
participants. We also assessed self-reported participation in intervention
activities outside the group sessions. At 6&#x2009;months, we asked &#x201C;During the 3-month
Sugar Champ Program, how often did you and your Sidekick/Peer Educator discuss
or work on activities from the program?&#x201D; and &#x201C;Since completing the 3-month Sugar
Champ Program, how often did you and your Sidekick/Peer Educator discuss or work
on activities you learned from the program?&#x201D;
        Limited efficacy determines whether the intervention shows promise of being successful,16 for which we focused on added sugar intake. We collected information on
dietary intake by having respondents complete the National Health Interview
Survey (NHIS) 5-factor dietary screener26 at baseline and 6&#x2009;months. We used this information to estimate median
added sugar (tsp/day) by using standard methods that combine reported intakes of
regular sodas, fruit-flavored drinks, pastries, and desserts to create
variance-adjusted estimates recommended by NHIS. We also used information from
the NHIS 5-factor dietary screener to estimate median fruit &amp; vegetable
intake excluding fried potatoes (servings/day) as a control outcome (ie, outcome
where we did not expect change). Of note, NHIS recommends that dietary estimates
from their 5-factor screened be calculated as medians and interquartile ranges
(IQR).

        Secondary outcomes
        We also examined change in intake of food items high in added sugars: (1) regular
soda (&#x201C;During the past month, how often did you drink regular, carbonated soda
or soft-drinks that contain sugar?&#x201D;); (2) fruit-flavored drinks with added sugar
(&#x201C;How often did you drink fruit-flavored drinks with sugar?&#x201D;); (3) pastries
(&#x201C;During the past month, how often did you eat doughnuts, sweet rolls, Danish,
muffins, or pop-tarts?&#x201D;); and (4) desserts (&#x201C;How often did you eat cookies,
cake, pie, or brownies?&#x201D;). For each of these food types, we categorized as
&#x201C;never&#x201D; if response was never, &#x201C;monthly&#x201D; if 1 to 3 times last month, &#x2018;weekly&#x2019; if
1 to 2 times/3 to 4 times/5 to 6 times per week, or &#x201C;daily&#x201D; if 1/2/3/4/5 or more
times per day.
        Given that Peer Educators were encouraged to share Sugar Champ information and
skills with other network members beyond their Sidekick, we also examined their
perceived SSB intake among their social network members broadly at baseline and
6&#x2009;months using a methodology we have employed previously.5 Participants completed an egocentric social network inventory where they
generated a list of 15 people with whom they had contact with in the past year,
which obtains a diverse group in terms of relationships and interactions. We
then ascertained behaviors of these individuals as perceived by the participant.
Participants were asked how often each person drank (1) regular soda with sugar
and (2) fruit-flavored drinks, sports or energy drinks with added sugar (daily,
weekly, monthly, yearly/never), which we dichotomized as &#x201C;daily&#x201D; versus &#x201C;not
daily.&#x201D; We then calculated the proportion of their network members whom they
perceived consuming (1) soda daily and (2) fruit-flavored drinks daily.

        Other baseline measures
        We collected other information including demographics (age, gender, race),
socioeconomic factors (educational attainment, employment status, food insecurity27), and health status (self-reported medical history, depressive symptoms28). We calculated BMI from measured height and weight. We determined other
lifestyle habits including smoking status, physical activity,29 and cognitive restraint for eating.30

        Analyses
        We conducted descriptive analyses of all variables. We compared baseline
characteristics between Peer Educators and Sidekicks using t
tests, &#x3C7;2 tests, or Mann&#x2013;Whitney tests, as appropriate.
        For our feasibility outcomes, we determined the percentage of individuals that
endorsed varying levels of satisfaction with Sugar Champ, self-reported
participation levels, and number retained for data collection at 6&#x2009;months. Among
Peer Educators, we calculated the median number of group sessions attended and
percentage that attended at least 6 group sessions. Finally, we compared the
median added sugar intake at baseline and 6&#x2009;months using Wilcoxon signed rank
sum tests. We also used Mann&#x2013;Whitney tests to compare added sugar intake between
Peer Educators and Sidekicks at each time point.
        We examined direction and magnitude of change for the frequency of regular soda,
fruit-flavored beverage, pastries, and desserts intake by each individual
participant. We also compared baseline and 6-month network exposure to daily
regular soda and daily fruit-flavored beverage intake using t
tests.

      Results
      We recruited 17 public housing residents to be Peer Educators along with 17 of their
network members as Sidekicks. Overall, mean age was 45.7&#x2009;years (SD = 12.0), 79.4%
were women, 97.1% were African American, and mean BMI was 32.1&#x2009;kg/m2 (SD
= 6.7). While we do not have access to demographic information of nonresponding
households, our sample characteristics are similar for other studies of public
housing residents in Baltimore City (Supplemental Table 1). There were no statistically significant
differences between Peer Educators and Sidekicks at baseline (Table 2). We note that these two groups had
similar demographics and health status indicators; however, food insecurity and
being a current smoker was more common among Peer Educators than Sidekicks (Table 2).

among Peer Educators (9 total sessions in Sugar Champ), and the majority of Peer
Educators met our participation threshold of attending 6 or more group sessions.
All participants were retained for follow-up data collection. Individuals
reported participating in Sugar Champ activities outside the group sessions both
during and after the program ended.

        Figure 1 displays the
change in dietary intakes. Overall, baseline median added sugar intake was 38.0
tsp/day (IQR: 28.3-47.5) and median added sugar intake declined to 17.2 tsp/day
at 6&#x2009;months (IQR: 11.2-27.8) (P&#x2009;&lt;&#x2009;0.001). Baseline median
added sugar intake was higher among Peer Educators than Sidekicks, 42.4 versus
37.0 tsp/day, respectively (P&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.62). There were no
significant differences between groups in median added sugar intake at 6&#x2009;months,
Peer Educator 17.4 versus Sidekick 16.9 tsp/day (P&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.84). As
expected, there was no significant change in fruit &amp; vegetable intake (Figure 1).

          Figure 1.

            Median daily intake of added sugar and fruit &amp; vegetables at baseline
and 6 months among sugar champ participants (n&#x2009;=&#x2009;34). Median intakes of
added sugar (teaspoons per day) and fruit &amp; vegetable (servings per
day) estimated from the National Health Interview Survey (NHIS) 5-factor
dietary screener at baseline and 6&#x2009;months. We used standard methods to
create variance-adjusted estimates as recommended by NHIS. We compared
median intakes at these time points using Wilcoxon signed rank sum tests
to calculate P values.
            M indicates month; tsp, teaspoon.

        Secondary outcomes
        Overall, 64.7% reported drinking daily regular soda and 50.0% fruit-flavored
drinks (Table 2).
Daily intake of other foods high in added sugar was also common&#x2014;35.3% consumed
pastries daily and 38.2% consumed desserts daily. Sidekicks had a relatively
lower intake of fruit-flavored drinks than Peer Educators at baseline, and
relatively higher intakes of pastries and deserts (Table 2). Table 4 presents the changes in regular
soda, fruit-flavored drinks, pastries, and desserts by each individual
participant. Over half of all participants had a reduction in their regular soda
intake, and interestingly, 12 out of 17 Sidekicks decreased soda intake at
6&#x2009;months. Fewer participants reduced fruit-flavored drinks. The Sugar Champ
intervention did not specifically focus on limiting other foods high in added
sugars, and fewer participants reduced intake of these foods (ie, pastries and
desserts) (Table
4).

              Number of arrows indicates the magnitude of change. For example, a
1-category change (eg, daily to weekly or monthly to never) would
have a single arrow, whereas a 3-category change (eg, daily to
never) would have 3 arrows. Abbreviations: M, month; &#x2206;, change;

              We report the 4 food types that comprise the estimated of added sugar
intake in the National Health Interview Survey 5-factor dietary
screener&#x2014;regular soda, fruit-flavored drinks with added sugar,
pastries (eg, doughnuts, sweet rolls, Danish, muffins, or
pop-tarts), and dessert (eg, cookies, cake, pie, or brownies).

        On average, daily intake of regular soda was perceived to be common among
participants&#x2019; social network members (44.9%, SD = 30.9%), which was not
significantly different between Peer Educators and Sidekicks (Table 2). The mean
proportion of network members perceived to drink regular soda daily
significantly decreased to 27.3% (SD = 29.1%) at 6&#x2009;months
(P&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.02). The mean proportion of network members perceived to
drink fruit-flavored beverages daily was 23.4% as baseline (SD = 22.2%), which
remained unchanged at 6&#x2009;months (22.0%, SD = 23.1%)
(P&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.80).

      Discussion
      In this feasibility study, we found that the Sugar Champ social network intervention
was feasible with respect to acceptability, implementation, and produced a
clinically meaningful and statistically significant decrease in added sugar intake
at 6&#x2009;months among adult public housing residents and their social network members.
Most participants appear to have achieved this reduction by decreasing their regular
soda intake, although some participants also reduced their intakes of fruit-flavored
drinks, pastries, and desserts. While we could only directly estimate added sugar
intake for Peer Educators and 1 of their social network members, participants
perceived a significant decrease in the proportion of their other social network
members who drank regular soda daily during the study period. These results may
imply that the strategy employed by Sugar Champ intervention promoted reduction in
SSB consumption throughout participants&#x2019; networks. These preliminary results
demonstrate promising acceptability, implementation, and efficacy.
      Prior research has proposed a link between social networks and diet, although much of
this evidence has been cross-sectional. For example, family members&#x2019; dietary intakes
are highly correlated (Feunekes, 1998).14,15,36 In our own prior
cross-sectional research among African American public housing residents in
Baltimore, Maryland, we found a significant association between residents&#x2019; added
sugar intake and higher network exposure to daily SSB consumption.5 These prior findings prompted the design of the Sugar Champ intervention.
While prior network interventions have been developed to address behaviors such as
HIV risk reduction and smoking cessation,21,31 Sugar Champ is the first
social network intervention to target dietary change&#x2014;reduced SSB consumption.
      In examining results by beverage type&#x2014;regular soda or fruit-flavored
drinks&#x2014;participants reduced regular soda more often than fruit-flavored drinks.
Prior research has found that fruit-flavored drinks have similar amounts of sugar as
regular soda.32 These findings prompted us to reexamine the Sugar Champ curriculum and all
materials to determine whether we may have emphasized reduction in regular soda more
than fruit-flavored drinks. In this review, we found that the beverages displayed in
program images and described during role-play scenarios were more often soda than
fruit-flavored drinks, which may have inadvertently emphasized soda. This factor may
have been critical given that prior research has demonstrated that adults do not
perceive fruit drinks to be unhealthy.33 Future studies of Sugar Champ should ensure that images and role-play
scenarios are balanced between regular soda and fruit-flavored drinks to promote a
reduction in both.
      Our study has several limitations. This was a feasibility study with a small sample
size and used a single-arm trial design where outcomes were examined post or
pre-post. The small sample size may have limited power to detect statistically
significant differences between Peer Educators and Sidekicks; however, reporting
limited efficacy outcomes by these groups is important to ensure that the changes
identified were not driven by the Peer Educators alone. Prior network studies have
identified greater intervention effect among participants trained as
educators.21,22,34 We note differences in baseline characteristics between Peer
Educators and Sidekicks, and further investigation is needed to understand the
implications these differences. Additional trials of Sugar Champ are needed, such as
an RCT within a larger sample that compares outcomes over time between an
intervention and appropriate comparator group, before Sugar Champ should be
disseminated. In addition, we used a brief dietary screener to estimate added sugar
intake, which was the preferred instrument in regard to length and comprehension
when we shared options with community members prior to study start. This measure
captures most SSB; however, it is important to note that energy drinks and flavored
coffees were not included among the examples provided. While the measure used is a
validated instrument, future studies should consider using more comprehensive and
rigorous dietary assessment methods. In addition, our assessment of satisfaction was
brief, and findings may be inflated. We also were not able to quantify how often
Peer Educators reached out to their Sidekicks or other social network members, and
therefore, cannot determine whether these network members received adequate exposure
to the intervention through their Peer Educator. Future studies should consider
comprehensively assessing acceptability by augmenting survey measures with
semi-structured interviews. Finally, the compensation provided to study participants
for data collection and for Peer Educators to take part in training may have
influenced our feasibility outcomes, particularly satisfaction and
implementation.
      In conclusion, our results demonstrate that a social network intervention reducing
SSB consumption is acceptable, can be implemented, and produces significant
decreases in added sugar intake among adult public housing residents trained as Peer
Educators and their social network members. Although public housing residents are a
highly impoverish population with high levels of food insecurity,35 this study demonstrates that they can make significant dietary changes. Sugar
Champ may have been effective due in part to focusing on a few salient behaviors and
utilizing the natural social supports in the environment. These findings warrant
further investigation of social network interventions to promote dietary change in
an RCT.
