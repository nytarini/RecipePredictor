t and/or nutritional ingredient for the
manufacture of many food products (Erbay et al.,
2015; Pisecky, 2005). For the
production of cheese powder by spray drying process, it is necessary to prepare the
liquid form of cheese, described as cheese emulsion. This is mainly prepared by
melting the cheese with water and emulsifying salts using heat (Koca et al., 2015; Varming et al., 2014). The production of cheese emulsion
resembles the production of spreadable processed cheese, but the expectations from
emulsion differ due to the requirements of the spraying process. The main target is
to prepare homogeneous, uniform, stable and pumpable emulsion for a fine atomization
(Kelimu et al., 2017; Urgu et al., 2018; Varming et al., 2014).
      Milk fat has the ability to improve texture, acts as a flavour carrier and modifies
the visual characteristics of dairy products (Koca
and Metin, 2004). The fat reduction cause some undesirable changes in
textural, functional and sensorial quality of dairy products such as excessively
firm, rubbery, poor meltability, undesirable color and flavour. The removal of fat
from casein matrix causes a much tighter para-casein network, resulting in an
increase in viscosity of cheese emulsion system. This can cause problems during
atomization, but can be tackled by changing the formulation of cheese emulsion e.g.,
addition of fat replacers. Fat replacers are used to substitute or mimic the
functions of fats in dairy products. Microparticulated whey protein is a
water-dispersible fat replacer; manufactured from whey protein concentrate in a
process that primarily involves thermal aggregation at intensive shearing and low pH
(Singer et al., 1990). The small size and
round shape of MWP provide fat mimicking properties and improve creaminess of the
products (Liu et al., 2016). Addition of MWP
to the cheese can help to reduce the hardness due to the weakening of the casein
structure and improve meltability and flowability characteristics (Aryana and Haque 2001; Koca and Metin, 2004; McMahon
et al., 1996). When used in emulsion systems, it can be helpful to
enhance emulsification and stabilization, as well as to contribute creaminess,
mouthfeel and opacity. Although studies on cheese emulsion have been increased in
recent years (Hougaard et al., 2015; Kelimu et al., 2017; Ray et al., 2016; Varming et
al., 2014), fat reduction and also addition of MWP in cheese emulsion
system has not been studied yet. The current study investigated the effects of using
MWP for imitation of fat in reduced-fat formulation. Therefore, variations in the
stability, rheology, microstructure and sensory of reduced-fat cheese emulsions were
compared to full-fat cheese emulsion.

      Materials and Methods

        Materials
        Reduced-fat and full-fat white-brined cheeses were supplied by Pinar Dairy
Company (Izmir, Turkey). Cheese samples were packaged in rectangular aluminium
packages with brine and used to prepare emulsions after one month storage at
4&#xB0;C. The average moisture, protein, fat contents and pH values of
full-fat and reduced-fat cheeses were 53.51%, 13.87%,
26.50%, 4.72 and 64.98%, 19.46%, 11.13%, 4.88,
respectively. Simplesse&#xAE;, the microparticulated whey protein
(0.01&#x2013;3 microns particle size, 3.9% fat, 53% protein,
5% ash, 6.49 pH and 1.31% acidity) as fat replacer (CP Kelco Co.,
Lille Skensved, Denmark), and JOHA&#xAE; emulsifying salt were provided by
Azelis Company (Istanbul, Turkey) and Kipa Chemical Company (Istanbul, Turkey),
respectively.

        Cheese emulsion preparation
        Cheese emulsions were prepared with ground white cheese, water and emulsifying
salt of 3% (based on cheese weight) by using the same procedure according
to Koca et al. (2015). According to this
procedure, the ingredients were heated by adding hot water at 80&#xB0;C and
sheared in a blender (model LB10S, Waring, Torrington, CT, USA) at 6,000 rpm for
1 min. Subsequently, the slurry was heated in a water bath to 80&#xB0;C, then
sheared again at 6,000 rpm for 10 min. Authors found the suitable DM to be
25% for full-fat white-brined cheese emulsion for the pilot plant spray
drier. So, in this research, the highest dry matter content of cheese emulsion
was 25% considering the increasement in viscosity of RF. Dry matter
contents of RF were 15%, 20%, and 25% (excluding
emulsifying salt). In the preparation of RF with fat replacer, MWP was added
directly to replace 5%, 10%, 15%, and 20% of cheese
dry matter. The quantities of MWP were chosen based on manufacturers
recommendation and our preliminary experiments. FF was also prepared with
25% DM for comparison. Cheese emulsions were prepared in triplicate.

        Compositional analysis
        Moisture, fat and protein contents of cheese emulsions were determined by
gravimetric (IDF, 1982), Van-Gulik (IDF, 1981) and Kjeldahl (AOAC, 2007) methods, respectively. Ash
content was carried out using gravimetric method (AOAC, 2007). pH value was measured by using a digital pH meter (pH
320, WTW, 82362 Weilheim, Germany), and titratable acidity was expressed as
percent lactic acid (AOAC, 2007). All the
measurements were performed in triplicate.

        Emulsion stability
        Emulsion stability was determined by the centrifugation method according to Hougaard et al. (2015) with slight
modifications. 30 mL of emulsion was centrifuged at 1,600&#xD7;g for 5 min.
Emulsions were described as stable if no phase separation was observed after the
test. Instability was observed as separation into three phases. In instable
groups, each separated phase was measured and compared to their weight. The
effects of the holding time on stability were all evaluated using the same
procedure in which the samples were placed in a water bath at 45&#xB0;C for 60
min. All measurements were done in triplicate.

        Rheological properties
        Rheological properties were measured using a rotational cylinder viscometer
(Haake 550 Viscotester, Thermo Scientific, Waltham, MA, USA) fitted with a
SV-DIN sensor. The thermostatic bath (Haake DL 30 Thermo, Electron Corporation,
Waltham, MA, USA) was used to regulate the temperature at 45&#xB0;C during the
measurements. The viscosity and shear stress of samples were recorded by
increasing shear rates from 1 to 1,000/s in 360 s. The shear stress values were
plotted against the shear rates from the average measurements of 3 trials. The
average apparent viscosity results were reported at 250/s. In addition, average
the shear stress versus shear rate for stable emulsions were used to analyze
flow properties by fitting to the Power Law model (Eq. 1). The rheological model equation was:

          (1)

            &#x3C4;
            =
            K

              &#x3B3;
              n

        where &#x3C4; is the shear stress (Pa), &#x3B3; is the shear rate (1/s), K is
the consistency index (Pa.sn) and n is the flow behavior index.
        The root square mean error (RSME) and chi-square (&#x3C7;2) values
were also determined by using Equations
2 and 3,
respectively.

        Color evaluation
        The color of the samples was measured using a Hunter Color Flex colorimeter
(Hunter Associates Laboratory, Reston, VA, USA) and expressed as
L* (lightness), a* (greenness and
redness) and b* (yellowness and blueness).

        Microscopic evaluation
        Microscopic evaluation was carried out using a motorized light microscope (PSARON
Floptik HPTS 150, AIV Labs, Ankara, Turkey) which has &#xD7;4, &#xD7;10,
&#xD7;40, and &#xD7;100 objective lenses for imaging. Emulsions were
carefully dropped in the centre of a glass microscope slide and examined at room
temperature.

        Sensory evaluation
        The sensory evaluation was performed in agreement between three trained assessors
that have been working on cheese emulsion for years. Grittiness, mealiness,
graininess, flowability, mouth coating, glossiness and color were determined
using scales from 1 (representing none for grittiness, mealiness, graininess,
glossiness, flowability / watery for mouth coating / extremely white for color)
to 7 (representing very high degress of grittiness, mealiness, graininess,
glossiness, flowability / high consistency for mouth coating / dark yellow for
color).

        Statistical analysis
        Statistical data analyses were performed using SPSS version 20.0 for Windows
(SPSS Inc., Chicago, IL, USA). Significant differences between the means were
evaluated by analysis of variance (ANOVA) and Duncan post hoc test. Statistical
significance between mean values was set at p&lt;0.05.

      Results and Discussion

        Chemical composition
        The fat reduction in cheese is compensated by the increase in both protein and
water contents (Koca and Metin, 2004).
Therefore, the protein content of reduced-fat white cheese emulsion was higher
compared to that of full-fat counterpart (Table
1). Although the addition of MWP at different levels slightly
decreased the protein content of reduced-fat emulsion in a specific dry matter,
it was not significant (p&gt;0.05). The added fat replacer was whey
protein-based. Therefore, in the emulsion the amount of whey protein will
increase whereas the casein amount will decrease. On the other hand, fat levels
of emulsion decreased as the addition of MWP increased due to the lower cheese
amount added to emulsion formulation. Due to the similar reason, pH values of
the reduced-fat cheese emulsions (5.16&#x2013;5.42) showed a slight increase
with an increase in fat replacer, whereas the acidity levels decreased because
of the high pH value (6.49) of MWP.

        Emulsion stability
        Stability refers to the ability of cheese emulsion to resist phase separation
over centrifugation and holding time. The phase separation after centrifugation
was not observed for RF 25 and RF 20 as well as FF 25 and they remained stable
during 60 min holding time, whereas RF 15 was not stable at any stages (Table 2). In other words, to have a stable
emulsion of reduced-fat white cheese, it was necessary to prepare an emulsion
with at least 20% DM. These data confirm the results in previous study on
cheese emulsion reported by Urgu et al.
(2018). In fact, proteins are the primary emulsifiers in the cheese
emulsion system and responsible for the resistance to the changes during
centrifugation (Cernikova et al., 2017;
Lobato-Calleros et al., 2006). The
casein-dominated matrix of reduced-fat cheese improved the degree of
emulsification and caused high degree of cross-linking in the network exhibiting
high resistance to the changes during centrifugation. On the other hand, a
decrease in DM resulted in a decrease in protein level in the system which
lowered the emulsifying ability. The addition of MWP did not have any
considerable effects on improving the stability in RF 15. Moreover, increasing
the amount of MWP had also no effect on stability. In contrast to our result, it
is reported that whey proteins are generally used to stabilize emulsions due to
their capability to adsorb at the oil and water interface (Sun et al., 2015). It is difficult to compare our results
with emulsion or dispersion systems studied, because the emulsion system in
cheese emulsion is more complex. The stability of the cheese emulsions depends
on the casein content, pH, ionic strength and temperature and their effects on
the molecular interactions of the adsorbed protein. In present study, MWP was
added to replace of cheese dry matter, so the addition of MWP caused a reduction
in the casein content of emulsion, which is the primary emulsifiers in the
cheese matrix. The cheese emulsion is as a stable oil-in-water emulsion
supported by a gel network of emulsified casein proteins. So, the casein amount
is also important for the reactions between emulsifying salt and protein during
melting process.

              Means with the different letter in the column for reduced-fat cheese
emulsion sample group with 15% DM having different MWP are
significantly different (p&lt;0.05).

              MWP, microparticulated whey protein; FF 25, full-fat cheese emulsion

DM; RF 15, reduced-fat cheese emulsion with 15% DM.

        Rheological measurements
        Rheological properties in cheese emulsion is a key factor for a fine atomization
in the spray drying process. Rheological measurements were applied to stable
emulsions (FF 25, RF 25, and RF 20 with different MWP concentration), because
the instable emulsion (RF 15) should not be used as a feed during atomization.
In addition, our pre-experiments showed that instable emulsions had very low
viscosity because of insufficient emulsification, which causes misconception for
comparison. The fat reduction caused significant increases in the shear stress
and average apparent viscosity values of the samples (Fig. 1 and Table 3).
Reduction in DM from 25% to 20% decreased apparent viscosity, but
RF 20 had still higher apparent viscosity (0.405 Pa.s) when compared to FF 25
(0.138 Pa.s). In reduced-fat cheese, a high level of protein that tends to make
the cheese firm and difficult to melt caused an increase in shear rate and
apparent viscosity. The protein content of RF 20 had still higher than that of
FF 25 (Table 1). Besides, the dry matter
of a reduced-fat emulsion should not be decreased to 15% due to its
instability problem. The reduction of fat content in cheese emulsion had an
adverse effect on flowability and resulted in problems in pumping and droplet
formation during atomization due to their high viscosity. Both RF samples
without MWP having higher shear stress values were observed as too viscous for
atomization. Our hypothesis was that addition of MWP can decrease stress values
and increase flowability of reduced-fat emulsions. MWP particles have good
lubrication properties due to small particle size and spherical shape which
called as a ball-bearing mechanism (Liu et al.,
2016). Aryana and Haque (2001)
reported that microparticulated protein imparts discontinuity to the protein
matrix, just as milk fat globules do in full-fat cheese, which results in softer
low-fat cheese. Fortunately, the use of MWP had positive effects on the
viscosity and flowability of samples. It was able to interrupt the continuity of
the firm para-casein network, to improve creaminess and to reduce the viscosity.
Shear stress values of RF dramatically decreased even with the addition of the
lowest level of MWP (5% based on DM). In our study, one of the aims was
to find the optimum amount of MWP which imitates the flow behavior of FF 25. In
earlier studies, FF 25 was found suitable for feeding to pilot plant spray drier
(Erbay et al., 2015; Koca et al., 2015). The reduced-fat samples
with 25% DM in all concentrations of MWP had higher apparent viscosity
values than that of FF 25. With respect to 20% DM, the use of more than
10% MWP based on DM showed similar values to FF 25. In addition, RF 20
containing more than 15% MWP had relatively low viscosity compared to FF
25. These results showed that the amount of MWP used was very important for the
feeding properties of emulsion used for cheese powder production.

        The shear stress versus shear rate profiles clearly indicated that samples had
non-Newtonian rheological properties. All the stable emulsions exhibited
pseudoplastic (shear thinning) behavior (n&lt;1) (Table 3), meaning that resistance to flow decreases with the
increase in shear rate and the change in viscosity was independent of time.
Rheological parameters were changed with the fat reduction and the MWP addition
amount. RF 25 showed higher K and lower n values, but increasing amount of MWP
added to the sample helped to decrease in K values, indicating lower consistency
of the reduced-fat cheese emulsions. Thus, the addition of MWP to reduced-fat
cheese emulsion system helps to reduce the consistency and increase the flow
behavior. The rheological parameters of RF 20 with MWP more than 10% were
found similar to full-fat emulsion. Kelimu et al.
(2017) reported that the addition of some dairy ingredients (sodium
caseinate, butter milk powder and their combinations) had a significant change
in the rheological parameters of Cheddar-soft cheese emulsion system, higher K
and lower n values were obtained in samples with the emulsifying salt, whereas
the opposite tendency was observed with the addition of sodium caseinate.

        Microscopic evaluation of white cheese emulsions
        The micrographs of FF 25, RF 25, RF 20, and RF 20 with 15% MWP were shown
in Fig. 2. The microscop image of FF 25 was
chosen for the indication of the stable and pumpable white cheese emulsion and
RF 20 with 15% MWP which gives the similar rheological properties with FF
25 was represented as an indication of a fat replacer effect. RF 20 was also
given as a control sample for evaluating the effects of fat replacer. Images
were recorded from &#xD7;10 objective lenses of the microscope. Higher
magnification lenses could not be used for imaging due to the compact structure
of stable emulsions. Fat content had a major influence on the visual properties
of emulsion. RF 20 had a more compact and uniform network that consisted of less
fat globules (Fig. 2c) compared to FF 25
(Fig. 2a). Fat globules in FF 25 showed
a more open network with more space between protein aggregates. The higher
protein amount in RF 20 covered the fat globules and resulted in an increase in
the interactions between the protein chains. This was more obvious for the
samples RF25 having very compact and uniform structure (Fig. 2b). The addition of MWP in RF 20 resulted in the
formation of porous structure similar to FF 25, having fat globules entrapped in
the protein structure (Fig. 2c). Therefore,
MWP addition to reduced-fat formulation helps to imitate microstructure to
full-fat counterparts.

        Color evaluation of white cheese emulsions
        Color characteristics were significantly affected by dry matter, fat content and
the addition of fat replacer (Table 4).
Lightness was found higher in FF when compared to RF due to the high light
scattering ability of fat globules, whereas high amount of caseins in RF cheese
caused a negative effect on light scattering attributes. Addition of MWP
significantly improved light scattering ability of RF (p&lt;0.05), because
of breaking the casein network in the same manner as fat globules. Similar to
our results, Chung et al. (2014) stated
that the addition of MWP to suspensions increased the lightness of the samples
which was attributed to the influence of the protein particles on light
scattering. Yellow color of dairy products generally increases as the fat
content increases. This was noted in the white-brined cheese emulsion system.
The increasing in MWP concentration also increased b* values.
This could be attributed to the small size of MWP particles providing fat
mimicking properties. All the cheese emulsion samples had a negative
a* (greenness) values. Lower fat and dry matter contents,
as well as higher amount of MWP contributed the green color of the samples.

        Fat content and addition of fat replacer had significant effects on glossiness,
flowability and mouth coating (Table 5).
RF 25 and 20 had lower flowability and glossiness scores, and higher mouth
coating scores compared to those of FF 25. The addition of MWP to reduced-fat
formulation significantly increased the sensory scores of glossiness and
flowability and decreased the scores of mouth coating. However, addition of MWP
more than 15% concentration to RF 20 could result in higher flowability
than FF 25, but the same smooth mouthfeel. MWP can soften the cheese texture
(Koca and Metin, 2004) and gives a
creamy and smooth mouthfeel (Liu et al.,
2016) that may help to soften the reduced-fat cheese emulsion
structure. Sensory results of the emulsions were in line with the rheological
results.

        The grittiness, mealiness and graininess were also evaluated by assessors (data
not shown). These characteristics, which are not desired in cheese emulsion due
to the clogging of the atomizer, were not detected in all samples. It was also
noted that foreign flavor was not detected even in the samples with maximum
amount of MWP. The instable emulsions were also evaluated, and these samples
were perceived as too grainy. These particles can cause atomization problems and
to form scorched particles in the drying chamber.

      Conclusion
      The stability, rheological properties and microstructure of cheese emulsion are key
characteristics for the efficiency of spray drying and final powder quality. Fat
reduction in white-brined cheese emulsion significantly increased the apparent
viscosity that caused atomization problems during the spray drying process. The
ability of MWP on improving the rheological properties and stability of reduced-fat
white-brined cheese emulsions were investigated. The use of MWP significantly
reduced the apparent viscosity, and reduced-fat cheese emulsions with 20% dry
matter and more than 10% of MWP based on cheese dry matter had closer
apparent viscosities to full-fat cheese emulsion with 25% dry matter. Our
results showed that using MWP in reduced-fat formulation may be a good alternative
to obtain pumpable emulsion by softening the structure and providing low apparent
viscosity. MWP could not improve the stability of the instable emulsion whereas the
stable emulsions kept their stability. This investigation provided valuable
information about the emulsions made from reduced-fat brined-cheese by filling the
research gap in this field. On the other hand, the amount of MWP used for cheeses
having different composition and properties could change. Therefore, the optimum
amounts need to be determined for different kinds of cheeses. In addition, further
researches are necessary to investigate the effects of reduced-fat cheese emulsions
with MWP on cheese powder characteristics and to compare them with the
characteristics of full-fat cheese powders for the benefit of end-users.
