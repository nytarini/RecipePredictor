   The flip side of Natural American Spirit™ cigarette packs now align the brand with “Respect for the Earth,” a corporate social responsibility (CSR) campaign. It champions a “100% zero-waste-to-landfill” manufacturing facility, “earth-friendly tobacco”, easier pack recycling, and “U.S. grown tobacco” (Figure 1). Such marketing appeals to biospheric values with emphasis on the intrinsic value of the ecosystem, implying a moral imperative to act pro-environmentally.[1–3] Biospheric values inspire consumers to pay a premium for products perceived as eco-friendly, such as energy efficient appliances and organic foods.[3] Notably, the market share for premium-priced Natural American Spirit™ increased by more than 400% since 2002,[4] even as the number of cigarette smokers in the US declined to a record low.[5]

In reality, biospheric values are entirely incompatible with smoking cigarettes of any brand. Mass production of tobacco involves significant environmental costs, including deforestation.[6–7] Cigarette butts are the leading form of litter globally,[8] have a slow rate of decomposition [9] and release toxic chemicals that are harmful to mammals, insects and marine life.[10–11] Cigarette smoke contains more than 7,000 chemicals, at least 250 of which are known to be harmful (i.e., ammonia, hydrogen cyanide),[12–13] and secondhand smoke is a leading cause of poor indoor air quality.[14–15] In addition, a growing literature on thirdhand smoke indicates that volatile organic compounds and carcinogens remain in carpet, upholstery, and on other surfaces.[16]

Natural American Spirit™ is manufactured by Santa Fe Natural Tobacco Company™ (SFNTC), which is a subsidiary of Reynolds American™, the company that markets Camel™ and Pall Mall™ among other popular brands in the US. SFNTC and Reynolds have a history of promoting CSR campaigns with an emphasis on “greenwashing” the tobacco supply chain.[8, 17–19] Since 1999, SFNTC campaigns have advertised planting trees, recycling cigarette butts, and using wind power in its manufacturing facilities.[17–18, 20] However, we believe that the “Respect the Earth” campaign is the first example of CSR advertising on the pack itself. On-pack advertising is a particularly compelling channel as pack-a-day smokers would view the CSR campaign upwards of 7,300 times per year.

The new CSR advertising on cigarette packs highlights an important gap in tobacco control research and policy. Although the US Food and Drug Administration warned SFNTC about its intent to regulate potentially deceptive labeling of Natural American Spirit™ as “additive-free” and “natural,” the warning does not extend to the on-pack CSR messages.[21] Research is needed to determine whether exposure to the “Respect for Earth” campaign exacerbates consumer misperceptions of reduced harm that several studies have demonstrated for Natural American Spirit™.[22–25] In addition, media advocacy is needed to counter CSR campaigns and tobacco marketing that appeal to biospheric values. For example, Marlboro’s (recent/2016) “Stand for a Million” sweepstakes encouraged consumers to enroll by using the brand website to vote on where to plant a tree.[26] Tobacco education campaigns that highlight the environmental harms of tobacco production and tobacco waste (see for example: http://tobaccofreeca.com/environment/cigarette-butts-are-toxic-to-the-environment/) are essential to counter tobacco industry efforts to portray themselves and their products as environmentally friendly. Future research should test whether such countermarketing could reduce the appeal of marketing efforts to portray the world’s deadliest consumer product and its manufacturers as friends of the earth.
