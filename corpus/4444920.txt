        The ability of button mushroom (Agaricus bisporus) in changing physical, chemical, microbial and sensory properties of fish patties prepared from sutchi catfish (Pangasius hypophthalmus) was investigated. Two batches of fresh patties were prepared, one batch was treated with 15&#xA0;% button mushroom (TP) and other batch was a control (CP) without mushroom. The patties were packed in polythene bags and stored under refrigerated condition (6&#x2009;&#xB1;&#x2009;2&#x2009;&#xBA;C) without adding any preservatives for the estimation of storage stability. The analyses of patties were conducted at regular intervals of 3&#xA0;days. The results showed that, Peroxide value, Thiobarbituric acid value, Free fatty acids increased significantly in CP at the end of 12&#xA0;days whereas the TP was within the acceptable limit up to 16&#xA0;days. Total volatile base nitrogen and Trimethylamine nitrogen also showed a similar trend. The Total plate count and Aerobic spore formers showed an increasing trend in CP when compared to TP. The sensory scores showed that the overall acceptability of CP were lower than TP, which was acceptable even after 16&#xA0;days of storage. The present study showed that, the quality and storage stability of TP were observed to be in good condition up to 16&#xA0;days and started deteriorating 20th day onwards, whereas the CP were acceptable only up to 12&#xA0;days. Therefore it can be recommended that, addition of 15&#xA0;% of button mushroom to sutchi catfish patty not only increases the nutritional quality but also increases the shelf life of patties under refrigerated storage.
