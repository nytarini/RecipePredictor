d constituent of a daily diet.
Change for consumers&#x2019; demands and increased market competitions have induced
a requirement for improving the quality of meat products as beef patty by developing
their nutrient values and advantageous-health qualities (Lopez-Lopez et al., 2011). Nevertheless, fresh meat and meat
products are highly responsive to quality deterioration because of the higher
nutrient constitution (Shah et al., 2014).
Frozen storage has been allowed as the most efficient procedure for preserving the
attribute for meat products over an extended period of time. The meat quality can be
deteriorated because of the physico-chemical process and, consequently, various
researches have been presented that the oxidation of lipid is a prime cause for
losing the qualities for several types of meat plus processed meats during frozen
storage (Ozer and Saricoban, 2010). In
addition, auto-oxidation is occurred broadly leading to a reduced functional quality
of meats and meat-based products throughout frozen storage (Mielnik et al., 2003).
      One of the important factors for meat quality deterioration is the oxidative process
which affects lipid, protein, carbohydrate, vitamins, and pigments. Oxidative
deterioration induces mainly lipid oxidation and results in loss of nutritional
quality and sensorial attributes and reduction of shelf-life for meat-based products
(Soriano et al., 2018). Lipid originated
reactive oxygen species and oxidizing myoglobin by-products lead to meat oxidation
and dramatically decrease quality properties such as color, flavor, and nutrient
value of meat products (Seo et al., 2019).
Moreover, protein oxidation results in a change for amino acid structure,
tenderness, and water-retention capability for meats and processed meats causing a
decrease in meat products quality (Turgut et al.,
2016).
      The uses of antioxidants supplements have been proven to be an efficient plan for
delaying or preventing the oxidizing procedures. Therefore, ascorbic acid (AA) is
usually employed as an antioxidant supplement during processing of meats. AA is
soluble in water, employed as the additives based on the rule of &#x2018;proper
amount&#x2019; to hinder deterioration of meat product quality, and is regarded for
having no toxic impacts for the consumer (Carballo et
al., 2018; Ozer and Saricoban,
2010). Moreover, Butylated hydroxytoluene (BHT) is a widely utilized
artificial antioxidant which is efficient to purify peroxyl radical and restrain the
origination of free radical. This is allowed to incorporate into meat and meat
product to slow or inhibit the oxidation and expand the storage stability (Kumar et al., 2015). Nonetheless, consumer
interests and requirements on naturally originated antioxidant substances have been
increasing owing to the antinutritional and toxicological impacts for synthetically
antioxidant substances like BHT, butylated hydroxyanisole (BHA) or propyl gallate
(Carballo et al., 2018; Shah et al., 2014).
      Clove (Syzigium aromaticum L.), is belonged to the Myrtaceae family,
is a dried-up flower bud and is largely utilized in the food products as it
possesses a specific aroma and effective health attributes. Clove contains phenolic
constituents like tannins, sesquiterpenes, and triterpenoids which can show
antioxidant activities (Ramadan et al., 2013;
Zhang et al., 2017). Clove extract (CE)
acquired from the entire clove bud has been widely examined to show high antioxidant
actions in meat products (Shi et al., 2014).
In that context, CEs as natural antioxidant have been employed for meats and
meat-based products to increase lipid and protein stability against oxidization,
enhance color stabilization and sensorial properties, and lengthen the shelf-life at
the storage time (Shi et al., 2014; Zhang et al., 2017).
      The uses of natural antioxidant have been expanded for improving the oxidizing
stability for meats and meat-based products over the past years (Armenteros et al., 2016). Zhang et al. (2016) has recorded that CE as a natural
antioxidant has been used potentially in meat products for improving the oxidizing
stability. However, it has been utilized BHT and AA as antioxidants in the meat
industries (Carballo et al., 2018; Cunha et al., 2018). Considering this, fresh
beef patties were formulated with BHT, AA, and CE, and it was examined the
comparison for the impacts of abovementioned antioxidants on oxidizing stability,
color stableness, and heme iron content for fresh beef patties. Nonetheless, no
comparative analysis has been conducted for the antioxidative effect of CE with AA
and BHT on the stability of fresh beef patties, especially at frozen storage.
      The purpose for the existing study was to determine the antioxidative effect of CE
compared to AA and BHT on the stability of fresh beef patties. Cooking loss, pH,
lipid oxidization, protein oxidization, heme iron level, and color values of fresh
beef patties were evaluated during 6 months of frozen storage. Fresh beef patties
with added no antioxidants were employed as the control.

      Materials and Methods

        Formulation of clove extract
        Clove was purchased from the domestic market. The clove powder extract was got
utilizing the method of reflux extraction. After grinding of clove, the powder
was mixed into the distilled water (w/v, 1:5 ratios) and carried for extraction
at 85&#xB0;C for 7 h. Likewise, the extraction for residue was conducted using
distilled water (1:5 ratios) for 14 h at 85&#xB0;C. The extracted two
solutions were filtrated with filter paper of Whatman No. 1. The eventual CE was
collected after condensing the solution through a void rotating evaporator at
85&#xB0;C. The CE was preserved at &#x2212;60&#xB0;C to continue
analysis.

        Chemicals
        BHT, AA, 2-thiobarbituric acid (TBA), perchloric acid (PCA), sodium dodecyl
sulfate (SDS), tris (hydroxymethyl) amino methane (TRIS) buffer, and
5,5&#x2032;-dithiobis (2-nitrobenzoic acid) (DTNB) were obtained from Sigma
Aldrich (St. Louis, MO, USA). The whole chemicals utilized for the current
research was of the highest purities of analyzed properties.

        Formulation of fresh beef patties
        Fresh beef loin and beef back fat were acquired from the domestic market and
ground independently utilizing a meat grinder (GG-22, German Knife, CA, USA)
consisting of a plate set in 8-mm diameter holes. The study included 4
treatments, and three batches for each treatment were conducted 3 times for each
storage month (mon). The preparation of all fresh beef patties was performed
employing the same formulations. The beef loin, back fat, and all fresh
constituents were combined absolutely in the correct proportion employing a
patty mixer (5K5SS, KitchenAid, Michigan, MI, USA). The primary formulations
contained 90.8% beef loin, 8.0% back fat, and 1.2% sodium
chloride. The fresh beef patties (4) were prepared as control (without BHT, AA,
and CE), added with 0.02% BHT (BHT), 0.05% AA (AA), and
0.1% CE (CE). The patties (45 g) were structured through a hand held
patties maker. After packaging in the polyethylene packets, the fresh patties
were kept at frozen (&#x2212;21&#xB0;C) storage for 0, 2, 4, and 6 mon to
conduct the whole experiments in the laboratory of Meat Processing.

        pH and cooking loss
        The pH value of beef patties was assessed employing an electronic pH meter
(MP230, Mettler Toledo, Greifensee, Switzerland). The distilled water (30 mL)
mixed patties (3 g) were homogenized utilizing an electronic homogenizer (T25
Ultra-Turrax, IKA, Germany) for 25 s. For evaluating the pH of the patties, the
pH meter was calibrated through standard buffers of pH 4.01, 7.00, and 9.21 at
21&#xB0;C.
        The cooking loss (%) for fresh beef patties was measured by the
calculation of weight difference between uncooked and cooked patties as
followed:

        Lipid oxidation
        Thiobarbituric acid reactive substances (TBARS) of beef patties were assessed to
measure the lipid oxidation employing the minor modified method adopting from
Cherian et al. (2007). Fresh beef
patties (3 g) were homogenized through 3.86% perchloric acid (27 mL) and
stored for 1 h at 5&#xB0;C. The homogenate was centrifuged (1736R, Labogene,
Seoul, Korea) at 2,100 g for 10 min. After filtrating the supernatant, filtrate
(2 mL) was admixed into 20 mM TBA (2 mL) and allowed to stay at room-temperature
for 14 h. The absorbance was evaluated at 531 nm spectrophotometrically (Cary 60
UV-Vis, Agilent Technologies, Santa Clara, CA, USA). The TBARS values were
stated as mg malondialdehyde (MDA)/kg patties.

        Protein oxidation
        Thiol content for different patties was determined for measuring the protein
oxidization using the method described by Vossen
and De Smet (2015) with some modifications. The patties (2 g) were
homogenized through 27 mL of 5% SDS in 0.10 M Tris buffer and transferred
to the water-bath at 80&#xB0;C for 30 min. The coolness formed homogenate was
centrifuged at 6,000 g for 20 min. The filtrated supernatant (0.5 mL) was added
to 2 mL of 0.1 M TRIS buffer (pH 8.0) and 0.5 mL of 10 mM DTNB
(5,5&#x2032;-dithiobis (2-nitrobenzoic acid) in 0.1 M TRIS buffer to evaluate
the thiol content. Filtrated supernatant (0.5 mL) was incorporated into 0.1 M
TRIS buffer (2.5 mL) to evaluate the protein content. Moreover, the reagent
blank was formed by mixing 5% SDS in TRIS buffer (0.5 mL), 10 mM DTNB
(0.5 mL), and 0.1 M TRIS buffer (2.0 mL). All solutions were allowed for
reacting in the dark place at 5&#xB0;C for 30 min. Absorbance for thiol
content was then read at 412 nm. The calculation for thiol content was done
employing the Lambert-Beer equation of &#x3B5;412
= 14,000 M&#x2212;1 cm&#x2212;1, and the result was
indicated in nmol of thiol/mg of protein. Protein content was determined at 280
nm utilizing a BSA standard curve.

        Heme iron measurement
        Heme iron content of beef patties was measured employing the method explained by
Ozer and Saricoban (2010) with minor
modification. Beef patties (1 g) were added to 5 mL of acidified acetone
solution (acetone:distilled water:HCl=90:8:2) in polypropylene tube. The
tube was closed with a cap and permitted for standing in darkness condition at
room-temperature for 1 h. The tube content was filtrated using Whatman GFA as
glass filter paper, and the absorbance was evaluated at 640 nm.
        The calculation for heme-iron content was performed by calculating the whole
pigment as hematin employing the following formulas:

                  Whole&#xA0;pigment&#xA0;

                    (

                      mg/kg

                    )

                  =
                  Whole&#xA0;pigment&#xA0;

                    (

                      mg/kg

                    )

                  /
                  100.

        Color value
        Color values like lightness (CIE L*), redness (CIE a*), and yellowness (CIE b*)
for several patties were determined utilizing a colorimeter (Konica Minolta
CR-400, Tokyo, Japan). The standard white plate (Y=81.2; x=0.3191;
y=0.3263) was employed for calibrating the colorimeter, and each patty
was measured twice. The measurement for chroma (C*) value and hue angle
(h&#xB0;) value was carried out utilizing two equations of {(a*
+ b*)1/2} and
{tan&#x2212;1(b*/a*)}, respectively.

        Statistical analysis
        The experiments contained a sum of 48 observations (four treatments&#xD7;three
batches&#xD7;four storage periods) to conduct statistical analysis. All data
were exhibited as mean values of 3 replications with the standard error of
means. The data were examined utilizing a statistical software of Statistical
Analysis System (SAS) containing 9.3 version. One-way analysis of variance
(ANOVA) accompanied by Duncan&#x2019;s multiple range tests (p&lt;0.05) was
utilized to assess significant differences among different categories for fresh
beef patties and to assess the effect of storage period.

      Results and Discussion

        pH and cooking loss
        The measurement of pH and cooking loss was conducted for 6 mon of frozen storage
and is displayed in Table 1.
Non-significant change for pH value was noticed amongst all fresh beef patties
throughout frozen storage times (p&gt;0.05). Nonetheless, the pH value in
all beef patty samples was significantly increased (p&lt;0.05) from the
first to last time of frozen storage. Ozer and
Saricoban (2010) recorded that pH value for meat products increased
significantly during frozen storage. This increasing for pH value is due to the
production of ammonia arising from amino acids deterioration as protein
denaturation in meat products. The results are in accordance with Mokhtar and Youssef (2014), who noticed
that the beef burgers treated with BHT/BHA and CE showed no significant changes
for pH values compared with the control during storage.

        The cooking loss considers the loss of moisture and fat after cooking of meat
products. The insignificant difference (p&gt;0.05) for cooking loss was seen
among all patty samples at all storage periods. Nevertheless, the cooking loss
in all patties showed no significant changes among all storage times
(p&gt;0.05). It is reported that all antioxidants and storages times had no
negative effects in cooking loss. No cooking loss in beef patties formulated
with BHT, AA, and CE can be related to no fat and moisture loss. Non-significant
change for cooking loss in chicken nugget was seen after formulation with
antioxidants of sage, rosemary, and tea catechin (O&#x2019;Sullivan et al., 2004). Basanta et al. (2018) also reported that patties sample with
added plum pulp showed non-significant change for cooking loss in comparison to
the control sample.

        Lipid oxidation
        Lipid oxidization for fresh beef patties was assessed by measuring the TBARS
value at frozen storage, and the findings are exhibited in Fig. 1. Incorporated antioxidants and storage months
presented substantial (p&lt;0.05) effect on TBARS values. Maximal TBARS was
shown in control beef patties throughout the storage months; nonetheless,
antioxidants formulated patties exhibited obvious reduction for TBARS values.
TBARS value for all kinds of beef patties was significantly (p&lt;0.05)
increased from mon 0 to mon 6 of storage. The antioxidants like BHT, AA, and CE
formulated fresh beef patties revealed significantly lower TBARS values during
whole frozen storage periods when compared with the control (p&lt;0.05). The
findings noted that added antioxidants presented a positive effect on the
oxidative stability for beef patties. The increase for TBARS value for the
control could be due to the origination of increased MDA that has been
considered as secondary products for lipid oxidization (Zhang et al., 2016). However, non-significant change for
TBARS value was observed amongst BHT, AA, and CE contained beef patties for all
storage periods (p&gt;0.05). Ozer and
Saricoban (2010) reported that chicken patties with added AA had
significantly reduced TBARS value compared to the control patties. The
substantial decrease for TBARS values was found in CE treated pork patties
(Kong et al., 2010), chicken meat
sample (Zhang et al., 2016), buffalo
patties (Tajik et al., 2014), beef
burgers (Mokhtar and Youssef, 2014), and
pork sausages (Zhang et al., 2017). The
current study is in agreement with such results and indicates that the natural
antioxidant like CE can have been employed for enhancing the shelf-life for any
meat product. This antioxidant effectiveness of CE has been performed owing to
the phenolic constituents and the capacity for the hydrogen molecule donation to
deactivate free radical (Baghshahi et al.,
2014).

        Protein oxidation
        Protein oxidation of fresh beef patties was measured by the evaluation of thiol
contents, and the findings are presented in Table 2. The significant decline for thiol content in whole beef
patty samples were observed from mon 0 and 2 to mon 4 and 6 of frozen storage
(p&lt;0.05), indicated the proteins oxidization. A similar result has been
found by Feng et al. (2016), who revealed
that proteins oxidization caused diminished thiol content for pork sausage at
storage time. From first to last time of storage, the reducing rate for thiol
content in CE treated beef patties were lower compared to AA supplemented beef
patties and the control. The decline percentages for thiol content were shown by
ascending: control&gt;AA&gt;CE&gt;BHT (12.31%&gt;
11.20%&gt;9.51%&gt;8.72%, respectively). At the end
of the storage, thiol content reduction of 12.31% was seen for the
control patties; however, thiol content reduction for BHT, AA, and CE treated
beef patties (8.72%, 11.20%, and 9.51%, respectively) was
lower than the control patties. After mon 4 and 6 of storage, BHT and AA
contained beef patties presented significantly higher thiol content by comparing
with CE contained patties and the control patties (p&lt;0.05), nevertheless,
no significant change (p&gt;0.05) for thiol content was found between BHT
and AA contained beef patties. The CE formulated fresh beef patties presented
significantly lower thiol content than all other patties for all storage months
(p&lt;0.05). The outcomes are similar to the research analyzed by Zhang et al. (2017), who observed that the
significant reduction for thiol content was seen for CE formulated pork sausages
compared with the control, and this occurrence might be done because of the
balancing of the antioxidants and pro-oxidants effect for phenolic components in
CE. Jongberg et al. (2011) stated that
white grapes extracts led to a reduction in thiol contents for beef patties, and
it might be occurred owing to the presence of ortho-phenolic substances in
extracts. This thiol content reduction in beef patties by the addition of CE was
presented because of the ortho-phenolic component (eugenol), which could react
with thiol contents and produce thiol-quinone admixture; as a result, thiol
content was decreased (Zhang et al.,
2017). Nonetheless, silver carp fillet formulated with CE was seen to
hinder the decline of thiol contents (Shi et
al., 2014).

        Heme iron content
        Meats and meat-based products are important sources for heme iron connected to
protein. Heme iron content for fresh beef patties at frozen storage is presented
in Fig. 2. The significant decrease
(p&lt;0.05) of heme-iron content was seen for all types of beef patties at
frozen storage time from mon 0 to mon 6. The heme iron content in CE treated
patties was significantly increased (p&lt;0.05) when compared to the control
and BHT treated beef patties at all storage times, whereas non-significant
changes for heme iron contents were found between AA and CE treated beef patties
(p&gt;0.05). On mon 6, the beef patties formulated with AA showed
significantly increased heme iron content in comparison to BHT formulated
patties and the control (p&lt;0.05). The results specified that AA and CE
prevented the free of iron from heme-iron. The increase in heme-iron content for
antioxidant contained patties could have been due to the increased level of
soluble heme pigments and the contribution for increased extractability of heme
pigment (Ozer and Saricoban, 2010). The
reduction of heme-iron content occurred because of the releasing of iron caused
by disruption of heme and the increase of frozen storage times (Benjakul and Bauer, 2001; Ozer and Saricoban, 2010). Purchas et al. (2003) stated that the drips
freed from meat throughout storage comprised a substantial quantity of iron,
especially soluble heme-iron. Moreover, Buzala et
al. (2016) reported that heme-iron is mostly located in meat protein,
is involved in the contribution of the bright red color in meat and meat
products.

        Color evaluation
        Color is a precious quality mostly of meat products and makes influencing the
consumer for instant purchasing or refusing the meat products through
observation (Soriano et al., 2018). The
color values of fresh beef patties were evaluated for all storage months and are
shown in Table 3. From mon 0 to mon 6,
CIE a* and C* values were significantly reduced for all kinds of beef patties
(p&lt;0.05), nevertheless, non-significant change (p&gt;0.05) in CIE L*,
CIE b*, and h&#xB0; values was seen for all beef patties. The CIE L* value for
all patties presented non-significant variation (p&gt;0.05) throughout the
storage. The patties formulated with CE showed significantly increased
(p&lt;0.05) CIE b* value compared to the control at the final storage, while
the non-significant change (p&gt;0.05) for CIE b* value was observed in BHT
and AA processed patties compared with the control. This result is in accordance
with Radha Krishnan et al. (2014), who
reported that the CIE b* values of the spice extract incorporated chicken meat
samples were substantially higher in comparison with the control. After
4th and 6th mon for frozen storage, BHT, AA, and CE
supplemented patties showed significantly increased (p&lt;0.05) CIE a* and
C* value by comparing with the control patties. Moreover, a significant decline
(p&lt;0.05) for h&#xB0; value was seen for BHT, AA, and CE incorporated
beef patties as compared to the control on mon 4 and 6. The lowered h&#xB0;
value has been linked to a lowered decline for red color (Yousuf and Srivastava, 2017), indicated that BHT, AA, and
CE processed beef patties revealed lowered color decline compared to the
control. The result indicated that added antioxidants (BHT, AA, and CE) showed
preventative effects on discoloring for beef patties during frozen storage
moment. This might have been related to a reduction for lipid oxidization by the
addition of BHT, AA, and CE, since reduced lipid oxidization can cause reduced
discoloration. The previous studies showed that lipid oxidization for meat
products caused redness degradation (Hayes et
al., 2011; Jung et al., 2012).
The significant increase for CIE a* value was also observed in CE incorporated
pork patties (Kong et al., 2010), chicken
meat sample (Zhang et al., 2016), and
pork sausages (Zhang et al., 2017).
Moreover, Falowo et al. (2014) stated that
a preventative impact for natural plant extract on discolorization for meats and
meat-based products was found because of the antioxidative action of phenolic
substances.

      Conclusion
      The incorporated BHT, AA, and CE in fresh beef patties prompted a significant decline
of TBARS and h&#xB0; values and increase of CIE a* and C* values at frozen storage
for 6 mon as compared with the control (p&lt;0.05). Inclusion of AA and CE led
to significantly increased (p&lt;0.05) heme iron content in beef patties when
compared to BHT treated patties and the control. Moreover, BHT and AA added patties
and the control showed significantly increased (p&lt;0.05) thiol content
compared to CE treated patties. Nevertheless, the percentage in a decrease for thiol
content of CE treated patties was lower than the control and AA-treated patties from
first to last time of storage. It is definitely seen that BHT, AA, and CE showed the
antioxidant effect on fresh beef patties. The antioxidant impacts for three
antioxidants were more pronounced for lipid oxidizing than protein oxidizing. In
Sum, the inclusion for CE could have been employed as a safe and substitution of
artificial antioxidants in beef patties preparation to efficiently prevent lipid
oxidation and increase heme iron content and color stability. Therefore, the results
can be concluded that CE can replace the application of AA and BHT when the
formulation of fresh beef patties at frozen storage.
