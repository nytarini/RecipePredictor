a significant influence on colon cancer risk. Identifying chemopreventive
agents, dietary constituents, practices and/or diet supplements that promote gut
health and reduce the incidence of intestinal neoplasias and CRC could
significantly impact public health. Sphingadienes (SDs) are dietary
sphingolipids found in plant-based food products. SDs are cytotoxic to colon
cancer cells and exhibit chemopreventive properties. The aim of the present
study was to develop a sensitive and robust ultra-high performance liquid
chromatography tandem mass spectrometry (UHPLC-MS/MS) method for quantifying SDs
in food products and biological samples. The assay was linear over a
concentration range of 80 nM to 50 μM and was sensitive to a detection
limit of 3.3 nM. Post-extraction stability was 100% at 24h. SD content
in soy oils was approximately 10 nM. SDs were detected transiently in the plasma
of adult mice 10 minutes after gavage delivery of a 25 mg/kg bolus and declined
to baseline by 1 hour. SD uptake in the gut was maximal in the duodenum and
peaked 1 hour after gavage delivery. Disappearance of SDs in the lower
gastrointestinal tract suggests either rapid metabolism to yet unidentified
products or potentially luminal export.

   1.0. Introduction
Colorectal cancer (CRC) is diagnosed in over a million people each year
(1). Worldwide, CRC represents 10%
of all cancers (2). In the US, it is the
3rd leading cancer diagnosis and cause of cancer death. CRC develops
slowly from pre-malignant colon adenomas and usually occurs in those over 50. The
long latency between development of colon adenomas and progression to CRC creates a
window of opportunity for chemoprevention in patients with CRC risk factors (3).

Epidemiological and preclinical evidence suggest that dietary habits affect
CRC incidence (4-10). CRC rates rise in developing nations as they adopt
“western” diets high in fat and low in antioxidants (11). Sphingolipids are ubiquitous membrane lipids found
in our bodies and many constituents of the human diet, including meat, dairy and
whole soy products, which contain approximately 600 pmol sphingolipids/ gram soy
(12-14). The average consumption of sphingolipids is about 0.3-0.4 grams per
day. All sphingolipids contain a long chain amino base backbone, which in mammalian
cells is sphingosine. Sphingolipid metabolism is a major activity of gut enterocytes
(15). Sphingolipids in mammalian food
products are degraded in the gut lumen by enzymes located in the brush border,
resulting in the release of sphingosine, which is actively taken up by enterocytes.
There, it is either utilized in lipid biosynthesis or converted to the bioactive
sphingolipid, sphingosine-1 -phosphate (S1P)(16). S1P is mitogenic and promotes colitis and CAC via STAT3-dependent
mechanisms that promote cell transformation, an early step in carcinogenesis (17-19).
Further, human colitic bowel exhibits genetic changes that favor S1P formation and
reduce its degradation by S1P lyase (SPL), leading to S1P accumulation (17).

Soy and other plants such as rice and wheat brans contain a unique family of
sphingolipids called sphingadienes (SDs) that contain two double bonds at C4 and
C8-positions (16). Desaturation of SD at the
C8-position are synthesized by Δ8-sphingolipid desaturase, which leads to
the formation of cis- and trans- isomers C18-sphinga-(4E,
8Z)-dienes (20). Higher
order animals can incorporate SDs from plants by direct absorption as the free
sphingoid base or by liberating SDs from intestinal breakdown of glucosylceramides
that contain SD as a constituent (20,21).

Metabolic fates of SD remain incompletely understood. The presence of
SD-derived sphingoglycolipids, sphingomyelin (SM) and ceramides in human breast milk
(22), plasma (23,24), animal
meats (25), and mouse brain (26) suggest that SDs may be in part metabolized to more
complex sphingolipids. However, little is known regarding metabolic role(s) of SD
and their downstream metabolic products.

We and others showed in cells and in vivo that
phytosphingolipids such as SDs exert chemopreventive effects in the gut and
attenuate tumorigenesis initiated by chronic inflammation (17,27-30). We discovered that oral administration of
SDs at a dose of 25 mg/kg bw reduces colon cytokine levels, upregulates SPL
expression, reduces S1P levels in colon tissues, and suppresses spontaneous
intestinal tumor formation, colitis and CAC in mouse models of CRC (17,31). We have
also shown that SDs reduce cell proliferation and induce autophagy and apoptosis in
CRC cells through inhibition of AKT, WNT and STAT3 signaling pathways (27,31).

Although SDs hold promise as chemopreventive agents, we are unaware of any
reports describing detailed methodology for their quantitation in food products and
biological samples. We have developed a facile assay to quantitate SDs with a
single-phase liquid extraction system which is followed by a rapid UHPLC-MS/MS
analysis. We show the utility of our assay for quantifying soy-type C18 (4E,
8Z) SDs in soy oils, tofu and human plasma and characterize the uptake
of SDs into murine intestinal tissues and plasma over time after administration of
an oral bolus.

2.0. Materials and methods
2.1. Chemicals
4E,8Z-Sphingadiene (SD), and
sphingosine (d17:1; C17-SO) were purchased from Avanti Polar Lipids Inc (AL,
USA). Purity of these standards were greater than 98%. Ammonium formate,
sucrose, potassium chloride, Tris-Cl, Ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (EDTA),
phosphate-buffered saline tablets (pH 7.4), diethylenetriaminepentaacetic acid
(DTPA) and formic acid were purchased from Sigma Aldrich and were of the highest
reagent grade (MO, USA). Isopropanol (HPLC grade), ethyl acetate (reagent
grade), chloroform (reagent grade) and methanol (LCMS grade) were purchased from
Thermo Fisher Scientific (MA, USA). Chelex 100 Resin was purchased from
BioRad.

2.2. Sample preparation
2.2.1. Standard stock preparations
Stock solutions of SD were prepared by dissolving 1 mg SDs in 1 ml of
methanol and diluting to desired working concentrations with methanol.
C17-SO internal standard was prepared by dissolving 2.86 mg in 10 ml of
methanol. Solutions were aliquoted into amber glass vials and kept in
-20°C until analysis.

2.2.2. Calibration curve
The calibration curve of SD consisted of eleven levels of
calibrators (0.08, 0.25, 0.6, 1.5, 2.5, 5, 10, 20, 30, 40, 50 μM).
The calibration curves were prepared in either PBS or in human plasma. Metal
free PBS buffer was prepared by dissolving five PBS tablets (Sigma Aldrich)
in 1L of milliQ water. To this solution, 3 g of Chelex-100 resin was added
and stirred overnight and filtered using a 0.45 μm filter. DTPA (100
μM final) was added to filtered PBS solution. Briefly, 100
μl of the calibrator solutions were added to either 100 μl
of PBS or human plasma and were extracted using the protocols below:

2.2.3. Extraction and homogenization buffers
Extraction buffer for liquid samples (biological fluids, medium or
buffer) consisted of Isopranol:ethyl acetate solutions (15:85 v/v).
Extraction buffer for tissues or other solid samples consisted of a mixture
of isopropanol:water:ethyl acetate (30:10:60 v/v/v). Homogenization buffer
for tissues consisted of 50 mM Tris-HCl (pH 7.4) buffer containing 0.25 M
sucrose, 25 mM potassium chloride and 0.5 mM EDTA.

2.2.4. SD extraction from biological fluids or buffers
Samples or standard solutions (200 μl) were mixed with 1.8
ml of PBS in borosilicate glass tubes (13 × 100 mm). To these
solutions, 10 μl of internal standard (C17-SO, 5 μM) was
added and briefly vortexed. Appropriate extraction buffer (2 ml) was added
and briefly vortexed. These samples were centrifuged at 3000 RPM at
4°C for 10 min. The upper organic phase was transferred into a new
glass tube with a glass Pasteur pipette. Concentrated formic acid (3
μl) was added to the bottom layer and briefly vortexed. Acidified
samples were re-extracted with the addition of 2 ml of extraction buffer
followed by brief vortexing and centrifugation at 3000 RPM at 4°C
for 10 min. The upper organic phase from the second extraction was combined
with the previously collected samples and vortexed. A two-ml aliquot of the
samples was transferred into a new glass tube and dried down completely
either under a constant stream of nitrogen or by using the speedvac under
ambient temperature (Thermo Savant SpeedVac system SPD1000). Dried samples
were reconstituted with 200 μl of Mobile Phase B (described in
section 2.3). and transferred into a HPLC vial with glass
inserts for injection.

2.2.5. SD extraction from solid tissues, cells or tofu samples
Frozen tissue sections (∼20 mg) were weighed and transferred
into a 2 ml tube containing 1 ml of pre-chilled homogenization buffer
(described in section 2.3.3). To these samples, glass beads were added to
each tube and homogenized using the FastPrep FP120 tissue disrupter system
(Thermo Fisher Inc.) with a setting of 5 for 30 sec. Samples were taken out
and vortexed, and the FastPrep homogenization step was repeated for an
additional 30 sec. Homogenized samples were centrifuged at 20K RPM at
4°C for 5 min. Supernatant was transferred to a new 1.5 ml tube, and
a 30 μl aliquot was taken for protein measurements.

For extraction of SD, 200 μl of tissue extracts were mixed
with 1.8 ml of PBS in borosilicate glass tubes (10 × 13 mm). To
these samples, 10 μl of internal standard (C17-SO, 5 μM)
were added and briefly vortexed. Two ml of extraction buffer (described in
section 2.3) were added and briefly vortexed. These samples were sonicated
in an ice chilled water bath for 30 sec. This sonication step was repeated 3
times. Following sonication, samples were centrifuged at 3000 RPM for 10 min
at 4°C. The upper organic phase was transferred to a new glass tube.
To the bottom aqueous phase, 3 μl of concentrated formic acid were
added and briefly vortexed. These samples were re-extracted with the
addition of 2 ml of extraction buffer, vortexed and centrifuged at 3000 RPM
for 10 min at 4°C. The upper phase from the second extraction was
combined together with the first, and a 2 ml aliquot was dried down to
completion using a speedvac. Dried samples were reconstituted with 200
μl of Mobile phase B and transferred into HPLC vials with glass
inserts for storage and injection.

2.2.6. Extraction of SD from soy oil samples
For extraction of SD from oil samples, 200 μl of oil samples
were mixed with 3 ml of chloroform:methanol (2:1 v/v) in boroscilicate glass
tubes. Internal standard (C17-SO) was added (3 μl). To these
samples, 1ml of PBS was added and briefly vortexed, followed by
centrifugation at 2000 RPM for 5 min. The bottom chloroform layer was
transferred to a new glass tubes. To the remaining top layer, 3 μl
of concentrated formic acid were added, and samples were re-extracted with
the addition of 2 ml of chloroform. Samples were vortexed and centrifuged at
2000 RPM for 5 min. Bottom fractions were collected and combined and dried
in a speedvac under ambient temperature. Dried samples were reconstituted in
200 μl of mobile phase B and transferred into a HPLC vial with glass
inserts for storage and analysis.

2.3. LC-MS/MS settings
A 1290 ultra-high performance LC (UHPLC) system coupled to an Agilent
6490 Triple Quadrupole (QqQ) MS equipped with Agilent Jet Stream
(AJS)-electrospray ionization interface was used. The instrument was operated by
Mass Hunter Workstation software. Precursor and production ion selection and
optimization of collision energies were performed manually by flow injection of
analytical standards. A Zorbax SB C18 UHPLC column (5 μm 2.1 ×
50 mm; PN 860975-902; Agilent, CA, USA) maintained at 50°C was used. A
binary gradient of mobile phase A (1 mM ammonium formate in water containing
0.2% formic acid) and B (1 mM ammonium formate in methanol with
0.2% formic acid) was delivered at a constant flow rate of 1 ml/min. The
total run time was 4 min. Initial gradient condition was maintained at
80% B and a linear gradient to 100% B within 2 min and was
returned to baseline condition at 2.1 min to allow for ∼ 2 min column
re-equilibration.

Mass detection was used in the positive electrospray ionization
(ESI+) mode with multiple reaction monitoring (MRM). The MRM transitions
used for SD detection were 298.2→280.2 [collision energy (CE); 8
V], and the transitions for C17-SO were 286.5→268.3 (CE 4 V).
The general source settings in the positive ionization modes were as follows:
gas temperature 200°C; gas flow, 14 Lmin-1; nebulizer 20 psi; sheath gas
temperature 250°C; sheath gas flow 11 L min-1; capillary voltage 3000 V;
and nozzle voltage; 0V. The fragmentor voltage of 380V and a dwell time of 15 ms
were used for all mass transitions, and both Q1 and Q3 resolutions were set to
nominal mass unit resolution.

2.4. Human plasma
Human plasma was obtained by percutaneous phlebotomy of pediatric
patients undergoing endoscopy to rule out inflammatory bowel disease. All
samples were obtained from patients with no evidence of gross pathology on
endoscopic inspection and no evidence of microscopic pathology on biopsy
samples. Blood was collected in EDTA tubes, and plasma was isolated by low speed
centrifugation at 4°C. Samples remained in -80°C until use.
These studies were conducted in accordance with an approved Institutional Review
Board (IRB) protocol. Human plasma was used for testing matrix effects, recovery
and precision of our SD assay.

2.5. Oral SD absorption time course study
To determine the time course of SD uptake in the gut tissues and plasma,
SD solutions (4mg/ml) were prepared in 0.5% methylcellulose (w/v)
dissolved in pH 4.0 water. Solutions were kept in 4°C for 2 hours to
allow SD to be solubilized in methylcelluose solution. This dose of SD was used
based on our prior evidence of efficacy in lowering gut inflammation in mice
(27). C57/BL6 wild type mice of 8-12
weeks of age were weighed, and SD was delivered by oral gavage at a dose of 25
mg/kg body weight. Baseline samples were obtained from mice (n = 3)
administered vehicle (0.5% methylcellulose solution without SD).
Additional groups of mice were euthanized at each specified time point by
CO2 asphyxiation (n = 3 per time point), followed by
exsanguination with cardiac puncture to obtain blood. Duodenum, jejunum, ileum,
and colon sections were separated, flushed with cold PBS, and flash-frozen in
liquid nitrogen. Samples were stored in -80°C until analysis. All animal
care, husbandry, euthanasia and tissue harvest in this study were performed in
accordance with approved Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee
protocols.

2.6. Data analysis
2.6.1. Matrix effect
MS/MS areas generated from known amounts of standards (A) in PBS
were compared with those obtained from plasma samples spiked with the same
amount of analyte (B). The ratio (B/A × 100) is defined as the
absolute matrix effect (ME%). A value of 100% indicates that
there is no absolute matrix effect. There is signal enhancement if the value
is &gt;100% and signal suppression if the value is
&lt;100%. For comparisons of ME across different biological
backgrounds, signals generated from C17-SO was used to quantify ME.

2.6.2. Precision and accuracy
The precision and accuracy studies were performed by calculating the
relative standard deviation (RSD) and recoveries obtained from the QC
samples. Intra-day precision (each n = 3) was evaluated by analysis
of QC samples at different times of the same day. Inter-day precision (n
= 3) was determined by repeated analysis of QC samples three times
over a 2-day period.

2.6.3 Linearity, limits of detection and limits of quantification
calculations
A 13-point calibration curve was generated for SD within the
concentration ranges of 0.08 μmol/L to 50 μmol/L. Linearity
was assessed by plotting the area ratios of SD over the internal standard
against the known concentrations of SD spiked into the plasma or PBS prior
to extraction. Linear regression analysis was performed to calculate the
slope and the intercept of the best-fit line. Limits of detection were
estimated by: LOD = 3Sa/slope of curve. Limits of
quantification were estimated by: LOQ=10Sa/slope of
curve. Sa is defined as standard deviation of response estimated
by Y-residuals.

2.6.4. Time course of SD absorption
SD concentrations quantified at each of the time points were
compared by one-way ANOVA, with Turkey's post-hoc tests.
P&lt;0.05 was considered statistically significant. Differences between
the total amount of SD absorbed in different gut sections were determined by
one-way ANOVA with Tukey's post-hoc analysis.

3.0. Results and Discussion
3.1. Optimization of detection parameters
A few mass spectrometry-based profiling methods to identify SDs as part
of structural components of complex sphingolipids in plants, animal tissues and
biological fluids have been reported (20,22,26). However, quantitative validation and
optimization of these methods for detecting SDs in food matrixes and in human
biological samples have not been described. As reviewed by (32), extraction methods using classic Bligh and Dyer
protocol for traditional lipidomic analysis are inefficient in recovering more
polar O-phosphorylated species such as sphingosine1-phosphate and possibly
SD-1-phosphate compounds. An alternative single step liquid-liquid extraction
procedure that preserves polar O-acylated SPLs and phosphorylated bases have
been described (33). In this paper, we
describe an adaptation of this procedure for quantitative assay for SD
screening.

Extraction efficiency is critical for detecting SD which is a low
abundant compound in plasma and tissues. We initially compared extraction
efficiencies of traditional two step Bligh-Dyer and a single phase extraction
with ethyl-acetate:isopropanol:water system that was described previously (33). Relative to chloform:methanol:water
system, the ethyl acetate:isopropol:water system afforded higher and more
reproducible recoveries of SD, other sphingoid bases (e.g. sphingosine) and
internal standards (data not shown). Extraction efficiencies, recovery and SD
and other sphingoid bases (SB)

To optimize a facile methodology for SD detection, a combination of
formic acid (FA) and ammonium formate (AF) were used as mobile phase modifiers
to improve separation and sensitivity of detection. Figure 1A shows the structure of SD with the dotted
line showing the fragmentation that yields loss of –OH group. Figure 1B represents the product ion scan of
SD, and it shows the protonated quasi-molecular parent ion
[M+H+] of SD at m/z of 298.4 and
a pre-dominant product ion m/z of 280.4, which is generated by the loss of OH
group. We also observed the presence of m/z 262.2 fragment specific for the
d18:2 backbone of SD, as reported by others (22). However, as shown in Figure
1B, the signal intensity for m/z of 280.4 was much higher and
therefore, we chose m/z 298.4 → 280.4 transition for quantifying SD. We
did not observe any significant in-source fragmentation of SD (data not shown),
and the fragmentor and collision energies were optimized to yield highest
intensity for detecting m/z 298.4 -→ 280.4 transition. For the
quantitative assay of SD, d17:1 sphingosine (C17-SO) was chosen as an internal
standard, as it is not a naturally occurring sphingolipid, and it shares similar
chemical structure and chromatographic behaviors as SD.

For chromatographic separation of SD, a Zorbax SB C18 UHPLC column was
chosen as a stationary phase. We initially compared the performance of this
column versus Phenomenex Luna 3μ C18(2) HPLC column but found that higher efficiency of UHPLC separation
method allowed rapid separation of solvent front and our analytes of interests.
As shown in Figure 1C, SD and C17-SO
co-elute at a retention time of 0.9 ± 0.07 min (mean ± SD).
Chromatographic gradient conditions were optimized to detect SD and C17-SO
internal standard within a 4-min run time. Additional equilibration time
afforded greater reproducibility in peak retention time when analyzing &gt;
40 samples in a single batch run (data not shown).

3.2. Determination of absolute matrix effect (ME)
Matrix effects, or ion suppression, can be defined as the change in
response observed for a given concentration of target analyte in the presence of
other sample components. To determine whether our internal standardization was
effective in compensating for the matrix effects, we determined the matrix
effects of plasma using the strategy applied by Matuszewski et al (34). As shown in Table 1, ME% of plasma was approximately
85.5 % across concentration ranges of 5-40 μmol/L tested.
Coefficient of variances of signal intensities in plasma was in general higher
than that observed in PBS (Table 1).
Variances observed in SD were closely matched with C17-SO internal standard
(Table 1). Matrix effects in other
complex sample backgrounds such as tissues and tofu homogenates were also tested
(Figure 1). Results showed similar MEs
in the different matrix tested, indicating that the extraction procedures
removed potential ion suppressing agents across the different biological
backgrounds with similar efficiency (Figure
2). Because the general recovery and signal intensities of our
internal standards were closely matched with SD, the mean accuracy after
adjusting for internal standard was similar in both PBS and plasma matrix. These
results suggest that our choice of internal standard optimized the detection
accuracy of SD in complex matrices.

To test for the linearity of the assay, a 13-point calibration curve was
generated with SD over the concentration ranges of 0.08 to 50 μM in PBS
and in plasma. As shown in Figure 3, the
linearity of SD standard curve was excellent with r2 &gt;0.99
for both PBS and plasma-spiked standards. The slope of the linear fit line for
PBS was 0.36 ± 0.003 (mean ± SD) and was similar to the slope
calculated for plasma-spiked standards (0.35 ± 0.004; mean ±
SD), suggesting that the correction of recovery variance made from the C17-SO
internal standard largely corrected the higher variances seen in plasma spiked
samples.

To estimate the limits of detection, a separate 4-point curve was
generated within the ranges of 5 nmol/L to 100 nmol/L. Slope of the curve at
these lower ranges were 0.18 ±0.005 and Y-intercept of 0.11 ±
0.0002 (r2=0.9987; p&lt;0.0001). Using the slope and the
standard deviation of this Y-intercept, we estimate the limits of detection to
be 3.3 nmol/L and limits of quantification to be 11 nmol/L.

3.3. Precision, accuracy and stability
Table 2 shows the precision,
accuracy, intra- and inter-day variances of SD quantification in plasma matrix.
Both intra- and inter-day measurements show excellent concordance. Precision,
expressed as relative standard deviations of measurements, were between 4.2 to
11% for intra-day and 4.3 to 15.3% for the inter-day
measurements (Table 2). Accuracy for the
lowest amount of SD spiked (0.2 μmol/L) was 81.8% and 86.4 for
intra- and inter-day measurements. Post-extraction stability of SD was tested by
re-analyzing the freshly extracted samples following 24 hrs in autosampler set
at 4°C. As shown in Figure 4, no
loss in signal intensity was observed for SD or C17-SO under these analytical
conditions.

3.4. SD quantification in soy oil and tofu
Soy oil and tofu products are physiological relevant dietary sources of
SD. To quantify amounts of SD that may available from these products, three
different soy oils and three different tofu products were analyzed for SD
content. Oil matrix required modification of extraction procedure, and SDs were
extracted from soy oil using the standard chloroform:methanol extraction
procedure as described in Methods. Comparisons of three soy oil products showed
a range of values from 4.2 ± 0.5 nmol/L to 18.7 ± 3.5 nmol/L of
SD (Figure 5A). Analysis of three readily
available commercial tofu products showed similar values across all products
tested with average values of 10.2 ± 3.5 mg of SD per kg wet weight. In
human breast milk, approximately 7% of SM contains SD bases, and we
estimate that ∼ 1.8 mg of SD can be derived from 1 Kg of dried breast
milk (22). Others have reported that
approximately 5% to 7% of SM from beef and pork is composed of
SD. Based on the total amount of 470 mg/Kg wet weight, we estimate that
meat-derived SM may supply ∼24 mg of SD per kg (25). Based on our calculations, the amount of SD in
tofu is comparable to amounts found in meat and therefore represent an excellent
source of SD.

3.5. Time-course of SD absorption in mice
Thus far, only two studies have examined the relative uptake
efficiencies of SD versus SO in cells and in mice (20). In human Caco-2 cells, accumulation of SO is
preferred over that of SDs and was found to be limited by the higher rate of
apical SD excretion by MDR1 encoded P-glycoprotein (35). In mice, SDs supplied as a component of
maize-derived glucosylceramide were absorbed into the lymphatic fluids at a
level that is approximately ten-fold less than SO (20). Although these two studies establish the
potential dietary absorption of SD, in vivo kinetic parameters
of SD uptake, including specific regions where gut-absorption may occur and the
rates of plasma absorption have not been directly addressed. To fill this gap, a
time course analysis of SD absorption in the gut and plasma was performed
following oral gavage with SDs (25 mg/kg body wt.). Absorption determination in
the gut tissue necessitated use of independent sets of mice at each time point
to ascertain approximate rates of absorption of SDs. Because of limitation of
this study design, fundamental pharmacokinetic parameters such as AUC, T1/2,
Tmax and Cmax were not assessed.

To determine, relative absorption across the small intestine, temporal
changes in SD content in duodenum, jejunum, and ileum were measured. Baseline
concentration of SD in the, duodenum, jejunum, and ileum were 230 ± 64,
130 ± 18 and 269 ± 66 pmol/mg proteins, respectively. Following
oral gavage, the highest increases in SD were observed in the duodenum section
at the 1 hr time point (38.8 ± 20.8 nmol/mg protein; p&lt;0.001)
and subsequently decreased to 1.3 ± 0.7 nmol/mg protein at 24 hrs.
Second highest accumulation was observed in the jejunum section. In this
section, the highest accumulation of SD was detected at 2 hrs, but the absolute
concentration was significantly less than that observed in the duodenum (0.3
± 0.08 nmol/mg protein; p&lt;0.001). Interestingly, concentrations
of SD in the ileum section remained unchanged following oral gavage, suggesting
that most SD absorption occurs in the duodenum. Measurement of SD in the colon
also showed lack of significant uptake over time (Figure 6D).

Uptake of SDs as a free base may be different than SDs absorbed as
components of more complex sphingolipids, such as SM and Cer. Others have
reported the presence of alkaline sphingomyelinases and ceramidases in the gut
that can hydrolyze and release SDs from more complex sphingolipids (36-38). Interestingly, the expression levels of both sphingomyelinase
and ceramidase have been shown to be highest in the duodenum and jejunum
sections of the small intestines (36-38). Our data along with
these previous observations suggest that duodenum and jejunum may be significant
sites of sphingoid base absorption in vivo. It is interesting
to note that the stable accumulation of SD was not observed in any sections of
the gut. This may be due to rapid apical excretion of SD by P-glycoporin, as
observed in studies with human intestinal cells (39). Small amounts of SD may be metabolized to other complex
sphingolipids.

The time course of SD absorption is shown in Figure 7. Baseline plasma concentration of SD was 0.30
± 0.001 μM (mean ± SD). Following oral gavage with SD,
plasma SD increased to 0.57 ± 0.06 μM within 10 min (0.16 hr;
p&lt;0.0001) and decreased to baseline levels within 1 hr (Figure 7). Considering the temporal patterns of SD
uptake we observed in the different sections of the small intestine, the acute
increase in plasma SD at 10 min may be more related to para-cellular leakage due
to bolus delivery of SD solution by gavage.

Anti-inflammatory and chemopreventive effects of SDs are garnering
interest in them as potential preventative agents against the development of
colon cancer. Despite promising data showing their anti- inflammatory and
carcinogenic effects, the exact mechanism of action of cytotoxic SDs are
incompletely understood. The bioactivity of SDs may be due to direct
interactions with unknown cellular targets. It is also possible that SDs
incorporated into more complex sphingolipids including Cer or SM may exert their
own independent anti-inflammatory effects. Evidence for apical secretion of SDs
in the Caco-2 cell system also suggests a possibility that SDs may modulate gut
mucosal cell populations. Apical excretion and accumulation of SDs in the
luminal side of ileum and colon or retention of SDs within the luminal contents
of the ileum, cecum and colon may allow for interactions with the gut microbiome
that may be protective against the development of inflammation in these regions.
In support of that notion, a spate of recent studies provides evidence that long
chain sphingoid bases and other sphingolipids may provide protection against
bacterial invasion and biofilm formation in vivo (40-43). In the future, it will be interesting to establish whether SDs
act at least in part by impacting and/or remodeling the gut microbiota.

4.0. Conclusions
We have developed a facile method for SD quantification that can be used for
food and biological sample analysis. Our SD extraction procedure and the use of a
C17-SO internal standard minimize the matrix effects of complex tissues samples.
Excellent recovery, precision and accuracy were observed. Linearity is preserved
over nM to high μM ranges of expected physiological levels of SDs.
Availability of this method will be helpful to other investigators seeking to
quantify SDs for nutritional chemoprevention studies.

Figure 1 Optimization of SD detection
Panel 1A shows the structure of C18
sphinga-(4E,8Z)-diene (m/z 298.4), the SD
used in the development of the assay. Panel 1B shows the mass spectrum of
collision-induced dissociation fragmentation pattern obtained with C18
(4E, 8Z)-sphingadiene. Please note the precursor ion m/z of
298.4 for the parent. Loss of water yields a major product ion of m/z 280.4. For
detection and quantification of SD, mass transition of 298.4 →280.4 was
used. Panel 1C show the total ion chromatogram and extracted ion chromatograms
for SD and C17-SO, which is used as internal standard for quantification.

Figure 2 Comparisons of matrix effects of different biological backgrounds
ME of plasma, tissue and soy homogenates were calculated as described in methods.
Average matrix effects were 87.8 ± 10.0, 78.3 ± 14.6, 97.6
± 17.5% in plasma, tissue and soy, respectively (Average of 6
replicates) and were similar across the different bioological matrices.

Figure 3 13 point-calibration curve for SDs in PBS and plasma
The linearity of SD assay over the concentration ranges of 80 nM to 50 μM
are shown. In panel A, the standard curve was created in PBS. Panel B shows the
identical curve generated in human plasma matrix. Extraction procedure involves
a simple liquid extraction with ethyl-acetate:isopropanol:water mixture followed
by collection and drying down of the organic phase. Dried samples are simply
reconstituted in methanol. Excellent linearity and similar slope and intercept
was observed for both conditions, indicating that the matrix effects of plasma
was negligible. The Inset shows the linearity of the assay over the lowest
concentration ranges tested.

Figure 4 Post-extraction stability of SDs in plasma
To determine the post-extraction stability of SDs, analyzed samples were kept in
4°C for 24 hours and reinjected. Panel A shows the extracted ion
chromatograph of SDs and C17-SO internal standards. Table shows the stability of
SD compounds spiked in plasma and as shown, minimal loss is detected at 24
hrs.

Figure 5 SD concentrations in common soy-based food products
Panel A shows ranges of SDs quantified in soy oil products ranged from 4.7 to
17.4 μM. Each brand was analyzed in duplicate. Panel B shows ranges of
SDs detected in tofu products.

Figure 6 Time course of SD absorption in the small intestine and colon
sections
To determine the uptake characteristics along the small intestine and to locate
major sites of absorption, intestinal segments were obtained from mice
euthanized at specified times following oral gavage with 25 mg/kg SDs.
Time-dependent SD uptake in the duodenum (panel A), jejunum (panel B), ileum
(panel C), and colon (panel D) are shown. Results are mean and standard
deviation of three mice per time point.

Figure 7 Time course of SD appearance in mice plasma
To determine oral bioavailability of SDs in vivo, C57/B6 mice
were administered 25 mg/kg SDs by gavage, and 3 mice were sacrificed at each of
the specified time points to obtain blood and tissue samples. A small but
significant increase in plasma SD concentration was observed within 10 min
following oral gavage and levels returned to baseline within an hour post
gavage.
