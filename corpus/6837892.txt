 of meat, and the OECD predicted that
global pork meat consumption in 2025 will be 12.54 kg carcass weight
equivalent/capita/year (OECD/FAO, 2016). Pork
is nutritious and contains high-quality protein and various bioactive compounds.
Regular supplementation of small amount of pork improves body growth, physical
activity, cognitive function, and immunity (Iannotti
et al., 2017; Kim et al., 2017;
Neumann et al., 2003).
      Currently, concerns regarding the safety of fresh meat and meat products are
increasing. Food safety, but not food tenderness or freshness, is the most important
aspect guiding consumers&#x2019; decision of purchasing meat (Loureiro and Umberger, 2007). Pork is vulnerable to microbial
contamination and is easily perishable as it is a nutrient-dense medium ideal for
colonization by various pathogens and spoilage microbes (Kim and Jang, 2018). Furthermore, pork can be contaminated at
many steps during processing such as bleeding, evisceration, skinning, and washing.
Improper storage and distribution during meat processing may result in contamination
with spoilage microorganisms and foodborne pathogens, which constitute the highest
meat safety risks (Domenech et al., 2015).
Previously, trichinosis was a health hazard associated with consumption of
undercooked pork, which prompted overcooking of pork to avoid the risk. However,
incidences of trichinosis have not been reported in commercial pork since 2010 owing
to evolution of strict hygiene systems. Scientists have attempted to ensure pork
meat safety by applying the HACCP system and enforcing nationwide biosecurity
measures. Ministry of Food and Drug Safety (MFDS) in Korea reported that the hygiene
of pork meat distributed in Korea was managed well during the monitoring period, as
the percentage of pork samples exceeding the aerobic plate count (APC) guidelines
was less than 1% between 2010 and 2014 (Kim and
Jang, 2018).
      Most consumers prefer to eat pork meat well-done or even overcooked to the point of
appearing burnt, rather than medium-rare or medium with slight pink color in the
inside. This is because of reports of pork contamination by the parasitic worm
Trichinella and food poisoning-related pathogens in the last
few decades. Several decades ago, the Korean government had promoted the consumption
of well-done pork to eliminate cases of infection by Trichinella
and similar pathogens. However, the incidence of Trichinella
contamination in pork is no longer reported and it has been eradicated in Korea
(Jang et al., 2018). In addition, most
pork meat in Korea is produced under strict hygiene conditions according to the
HACCP system. Therefore, pork meat does not have to be cooked till it is well-done
or overcooked to avoid the risk of Trichinella infection. The
United States Department of Agriculture (USDA) listed guidelines and recommendations
for safe pork cooking in 2011, which suggests 62.7&#xB0;C as the safe temperature
for cooking pork cuts; however, ground pork should be cooked at 71&#xB0;C for
safety. Owing to persisting concerns regarding pork safety, pork meat is still
overcooked to avoid microbial poisoning. This results in the consumption of dry,
burned, and unsafe pork steak, as exposure of pork meat to high temperature and long
cooking time induces the formation of several carcinogens such as polycyclic
aromatic hydrocarbon and heterocyclic amines. Pork meat thickness is also an
important factor determining the doneness as most Korean people eat 1.5 cm-thick
pork rather than 2.0 cm-thick pieces, while most western people consume 2.0 2.5
cm-thick pork as steaks. However, there is a lack of information to show microbial
safety and quality characteristics of pork meat of various doneness of different
thickness in Korea.
      Therefore, the present study aimed to evaluate the effect of doneness on the
microbial and nutritional property, and quality changes of pork steak of different
thicknesses (1.5 cm and 2.0 cm, as these are the common thicknesses of pork steak
consumed in Korea) for elucidating the safety and wholesomeness of pork steak of
different doneness.

      Materials and Methods

        Pork neck meat cooking conditions and doneness
        A loaf of pork neck meat was obtained from the local meat packing center within
24 h after slaughtering and was cut into 1.5 cm and 2.0 cm thicknesses and
packed in LLD-PE wrap. The wrapped pork meats were stored at 4&#xB1;2&#xB0;C
for 7 10 d until APCs reached 5.51 6.50 Log CFU/g, after which it was cooked on
a frying pan with surface temperature of 200&#xB0;C for different doneness
under the conditions mentioned in Table
1. Also inside meat color of pork steaks with doneness was shown in Fig. 1.

        Microorganisms
        For APCs and Escherichia coli/coliform counts, 10 g pork neck
was added to a sterile stomacher bag filled with 90 mL sterile water. The
contents were homogenized for 2 min using a stomacher (Bag Mixer 400,
Interscience, St. Nom, France). A serial dilution was prepared with sterile
water, and 1 mL of the diluent was seeded onto Petrifilms for APC and E.
coli/coliform count plate (3M Microbiology, St. Paul, MN, USA). The
films were incubated at 37 C for 48 h and APCs and E. coli
counts were determined according to the manufacturer&#x2019;s instructions.

        Proximate composition and total calorie
        The proximate compositions of pork neck were evaluated according to the methods
of Association of Official Agricultural Chemists (AOAC, 1997). Moisture content was analyzed using oven drying at
105&#xB0;C, and crude protein content was analyzed using the Kjeldahl method.
Crude fat content was determined using solvent extraction, and crude ash was
analyzed via ashing using a furnace at 550&#xB0;C. The total calories of pork
steak were determined by multiplying the protein and fat contents per gram of
pork by 4 kcal/g and 9 kcal/g, respectively (Rhee et al., 1993).

        Minerals
        To analyze the mineral contents (K, Fe, and Zn) of pork of different doneness, 2
g minced pork neck meat was placed in the furnace at 550&#xB0;C-600&#xB0;C
for 12 h. After cooling, the sample was digested with 10 mL of 50% HCl solution
overnight and filtered using a filter paper (Whatman No.6). The solution was
analyzed using an inductively coupled plasma emission spectrophotometer (OPTIMA
7300 DV, PerkinElmer, Shelton, CT, USA).

        True retention of minerals
        The changes in the weight of meat before and after cooking were recorded to
compensate for the weight of drippings, cooking water, or other discard. The
true retentions (TR) of minerals with cooking were determined using the method
of Murphy et al. (1975) as mentioned
below.

        Cooking loss
        Pork neck steak of 1.5 cm and 2.0 cm thicknesses were placed in a polyethylene
bag. The packages were heated in a water bath at constant temperature until the
core temperature reached 75&#xB0;C, after which it was cooled for 20 min to
23&#xB0;C. The cooking loss percentage was determined using steak weights
taken before and after cooking.

        Meat color
        The color of the pork neck on the surface and inside was determined using a
Minolta colorimeter (CR-400 Minolta Co., Osaka, Japan), and the Commission
Internationale de l&#x2019;Eclairage (CIE) color values of L* (lightness), a*
(redness), and b* (yellowness) were determined in triplicate. The instrument was
calibrated using a white standard plate before analysis with Y=93.60, x=0.3134,
and y=0.3194.

        Warner-Bratzler shear force
        The core temperature of pork neck steak reached 62.8&#xB0;C, 71.1&#xB0;C, and
76.7&#xB0;C according to the doneness for medium-rare, medium, and well-done
pork, respectively. The pork steaks were cut into 1&#xD7;2&#xD7;1.5 cm or
1&#xD7;2&#xD7;2 cm pieces and used for measurement of shear force using a
texture analyzer (TA 1; Lloyd Instruments, Berwyn, PA, USA). The texture
analyzer was set to a 50 kg load cell, 50 mm/min trigger speed, 50 mm/min test
speed, and 10 gf trigger force.

        Texture analysis
        Pork neck meat was cut into 1&#xD7;1&#xD7;1.5 cm or 1&#xD7;1&#xD7;2 cm
pieces and texture profile analysis was performed thrice using Texture Analyzer
TA 1 (LLOYD instruments, Berwyn, PA, USA). The test conditions were as follows:
compression speed, 20 mm/min; wait time, 5 s; trigger force, 10 gf; 50 mm,
diameter probe; sample compressed, 70%.

        Statistical analysis
        All analyses were performed at least thrice. One way analysis of variance (ANOVA)
was performed using the general linear model procedure of the SAS software (SAS
Institute Inc., Cary, NC, USA), followed by Tukey&#x2019;s test to analyze
significant differences among mean values at p&lt;0.05. Data were expressed
as means and SEM.

      Results and Discussion

        Microbial change
        Changes in APC and coliform content of pork steak of different doneness are shown
in Table 2. The APC decreased
significantly from medium-rare and medium to well-done steak, showing 4.58 CFU/g
APC, 2.36 CFU/g APC, and not detected, respectively, all of which were lower
than the APC of 1.5 cm-thick raw pork. The microbial inhibition rates of
medium-rare steak of 1.5 cm and 2.0 cm thickness were 58.26% and 51.70%,
respectively. Interestingly, the inhibition rate of medium pork steak of either
thickness was 100%, which was significantly higher than that of the medium-rare
steak (p&lt;0.05). The inhibition rates of medium and well-done steaks did
not differ significantly irrespective of the thickness. E. coli
was not detected in raw or cooked pork steak (data not shown). After cooking,
the coliforms were not detected in steak irrespective of thickness. According to
the MFDS in Korea, the APC level of pork meat should be below the
5.0&#xD7;106 CFU/g (6.70 Log CFU/g). This indicated that medium
and well-done pork steak of 1.5 and 2.0 cm thickness met the APC standards.
Several groups have investigated the relationship between cooking and microbial
safety of meat. Shao et al. (1999) showed
that compared to 3.14 Log CFU/g APC in original raw meat, the APC in 2.0
cm-thick raw emu steaks was reduced to 1.55, 1.79, and 3.14 Log CFU/g by cooking
when the internal temperature reached 60&#xB0;C, 66&#xB0;C, and 75&#xB0;C,
respectively. McKinley and Avens (1981)
observed that 3.4 Log CFU/g APC in raw ground turkey was reduced to 2.18 Log
CFU/g after cooking for 7 min in an electric frying pan, when the internal
temperature reached 71&#xB0;C&#x2013;77&#xB0;C, and microorganisms were not
detected in 46% of the samples. When mutton chops cooked at different end point
temperature (51&#xB0;C&#x2013;79&#xB0;C), APC levels of them was decreased
from 3.73 Log CFU/g up to 1.75 Log CFU/g (Sen et
al., 2014).

        Nutritional property
        The proximate composition and total calories of pork steak of different doneness,
from raw to well-done, are shown in Table
3. The water content of raw pork steak was significantly higher than
those of medium and well-done pork steak of either thickness (p&lt;0.05).
Compared to that of raw pork, the water content of medium and well-done pork
steak was reduced to 22.04% and 28.50%, respectively. In contrast, the crude
protein, crude fat, and crude ash contents of well-done pork steak were
significantly higher than those of raw pork of either thickness (p&lt;0.05).
Crude protein, crude fat, and crude ash were condensed due to reduction in the
water content with pork doneness. The total calories of 1.5 cm and 2.0 cm-thick
raw pork steak were 139.50 and 162.82 kcal/100 g, respectively. However, the
total calories of well-done pork steak of 1.5 cm and 2.0 cm thickness were
643.61 kcal/100 g and 675.00 kcal/100 g, respectively, which were significantly
higher than those of medium-rare and medium pork steak. This increase was also
due to elevation in the content of crude protein and crude fat, and decrease in
water content with doneness. Similar to our results, as the increase in endpoint
temperature of beef steaks, percent of fat and protein increased and the
calories consequently increase (Smith et al.,
2011). Rhee et al. (1993)
reported that the total energy of cooked ground pork meat containing 10% 20% fat
was higher (210 270 kcal/100 g) than that of raw ground pork meat (150 190
kcal/100 g). This indicated that higher calories were obtained from consumption
of well-done pork steak than from raw, medium-rare, and medium pork steak.

        The mineral content and mineral retention ratio of pork steak changed with
doneness as shown in Table 4. Pork is an
abundant source of minerals, which can change during cooking. Cooking is
essential to make meat palatable and safe. However, heat treatment can decrease
the nutritional value, mainly due to loss of minerals and vitamins (Gerber et al. 2009). Potassium (K) and zinc
(Zn) are major two minerals in pork meat. Also, iron (Fe) plays essential
minerals to human because when its deficiency causes several hindrances,
particularly disturbs normal development of child (Williams, 2007). K helps the human body to maintain the
acid-base balance, metabolism, and muscle building, and Zn required for the
immune system, helping in cell growth and wound healing, as part of many enzymes
(Williams, 2007). The Fe, Zn, and K
contents of medium-done pork steak of 1.5 cm and 2.0 cm thickness were
significantly higher than those of raw and medium-rare pork. In addition, the
mineral content of well-done pork steak was significantly higher than that of
1.5-cm thick steak of other doneness. Interestingly, the Fe and K contents of
medium-done pork steak were higher than those of well-done 2.0-cm thick steak
(p&lt;0.05), while the Zn of medium-done and well-done steak did not differ
significantly. This indicated that the Fe and K contents of 2.0-cm thick pork
steak increased with doneness from raw to medium, whereas they were low in
well-done steak. The increase in mineral content with doneness were in agreement
with the results reported by Tomvic et al. (2015) who showed that cooking pork
loin (1.5-cm thick) at endpoint temperatures of 51&#xB0;C, 61&#xB0;C,
71&#xB0;C, 81&#xB0;C, and 91&#xB0;C significantly increased mineral
content (magnesium, calcium, zinc, iron, copper, and manganese) compared to that
of raw meat. This increase in mineral content of meat can be explained as a
consequence of moisture loss due to cooking (Lawrie and Ledward, 2006), as we observed that the nutrient contents
in cooked pork did not increase but rather decreased after calculating the
retention ratio of nutrients. The mineral retention ratio in pork steak was also
affected by doneness as shown in Fig. 2.
When the mineral content of raw pork steak was 100%, the retention ratio for Fe
and K in well-done steak was significantly lower than those of medium and
medium-rare steak of either thickness (p&lt;0.05). The Zn content of 2.0-cm
thick well-done pork steak was also lower than that of raw and medium-rare pork
steak. This indicated that the mineral content of meat decreased and the total
calories increased upon overcooking.

        Meat quality
        The colors of both the surface and inside of pork steak of different doneness are
shown in Table 5. In the meat surface and
inside, the CIE L* and CIE b* values of medium-done steak were higher than those
of medium-rare pork of 1.5 cm thickness (p&lt;0.05). However, the CIE L*
values of medium and medium-rare steaks of 2.0 cm thickness were not
significantly different. The CIE a* values of steak decreased significantly with
doneness for both thicknesses and ranged from 6.91 to 8.36 for surface color,
and from 7.66 to 13.93 for internal color. Most consumers consider the color of
cooked meat as a reliable indicator of safety and doneness (Suman and Joseph, 2013). A brown pigment of
denatured metmyoglobin is formed when pork meat is cooked, resulting in higher
b* value. Meat cooked at different end point temperatures show reddish color as
all the pigment is not affected at the same time or to the same extent (Boles and Pegg, 2010). In this study, we
observed that the b* value of both surface and internal pork steak increased
significantly with doneness irrespective of thickness (p&lt;0.05). In
medium-done pork steak, the b* value ranged from 12.38 to 12.52 in the surface
and from 11.54 to 11.66 in the inside.

        Cooking loss, Warner-Bratzler shear force (WBSF), and texture analysis such as
springiness and chewiness of pork steak can change with doneness (Table 6). Cooking loss is highly related to
juiciness of meat and depends on cooking time and temperature (Winger and Fennema, 1976). Cooking loss of
the well-done steak was significantly higher than that of medium-rare and
medium-done steaks of either thickness (p&lt;0.05), which corresponded to
the water content loss of the steak (Table
1). Cooking time and temperature can strongly affect the tenderness
of pork meat (Bouton and Harris, 1972).
The WBSF of medium-rare and medium-done steak did not vary, while that of the
well-done steak was significantly higher than that of medium-rare steak of
either thickness (p&lt;0.05). The springiness of steaks of different
doneness did not vary significantly when the thickness was 1.5 cm. However, the
springiness of well-done steak was lower than that of medium-rare and
medium-done steaks of 2.0-cm thickness (p&lt;0.05). The chewiness of the
well-done and medium-done steaks was significantly higher than that of
medium-rare steak of either thickness (p&lt;0.05). This indicates that
well-done cooking makes meat dry, tough, and unpalatable. This observation is in
agreement with the sensory evaluation by 85 panelists (data not shown). The
panelists opined that the juiciness and tenderness of well-done pork steak was
significantly lower than that of medium-rare and medium-done steaks
(p&lt;0.05). In agreement with these results, medium-rare or medium-done
steaks were found to be preferred by consumers (Lorenzen et al., 1999); in addition, these steaks were more tender
and showed low cooking loss than well-done steak (Aaslyng et al., 2003; Chiavaro et
al., 2009). This indicated that the panelists found the well-done
pork steak dry and tough. Interestingly, however, some of the panelists
preferred the tough and chewy well-done pork steak. Therefore, we observed that
the well-done pork steak of 1.5 and 2.0-cm thickness was tough and contained
high calories and low mineral content.

      Conclusion
      Some Korean consumers prefer consuming overcooked pork with Maillard reaction
flavors. However, consumption of overcooked pork meat adversely affects health.
Therefore, meat consumption habits have to be changed and medium or medium-rare pork
should be preferred to well-done or overcooked meat, as the former provides more
benefits to consumers without compromising the microbial safety of meat. This is the
first study to show microbial safety and nutritional benefits of medium - done pork
meat of 1.5 and 2.0 cm thickness compare to those of well-done pork meat in
Korea.
