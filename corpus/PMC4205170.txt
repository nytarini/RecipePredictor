To examine the variability of food portions served and consumed by preschoolers in African-Americans and Hispanic-Americans attending Head Start (HS).

Design
Cross-Sectional.

Setting
Food consumption by preschoolers (n=796) enrolled in 16 HS centers in Houston, Texas (51% boys, 42% African-American, mean age 4 years) were assessed during three days of lunch meals using digital photography. Descriptive statistics and multi-level regression models, adjusting for classroom and school clustering effects, were determined.

Subjects
HS preschoolers 3–5 years.

Results
Mean amount served was 2428 kilojoule (kJ) (580 kilocalories [kcal]), and 572 grams. Mean intake was 1421 kJ (339 kcal), and 331 grams: 20% protein, 46% carbohydrate, 34% fat. Plate waste was 43% (range: 38% [fruit] to 61% [vegetables]). Mean coefficient of variation (CV) of food served was 29%: 33% entrée, 44% vegetables, 60% fruit, and 76% starches. Mean CV of food consumed was 46%: 58% entrée, 86% fruit, 96% vegetables, and 111% starches. Total gram amount of food served was positively correlated with consumption (r = 0.43, p&lt;0.001).

Conclusion
Plate waste and variation in amounts served and consumed was substantial; amounts served were associated with amounts consumed. Large portion sizes may contribute to pediatric obesity by promoting excessive intake at meals. Understanding factors influencing portion sizes provide insight about specific intervention strategies that can be used in obesity prevention programs.


   INTRODUCTION
Childhood obesity is a major public health problem. The National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey 2009–2010 data were used to show that nearly 15% of children 2–5 years (y) were overweight, while 12% were obese(1). Key contributing factors to overweight and obesity in children have not been determined; however, most experts agree that weight gain occurs when dietary intake exceeds energy expenditure. Children’s eating patterns are initiated early in life (i.e., 2 to 5 y) suggesting that the preschool period is a pivotal developmental time point during which healthful eating patterns may be fostered(2–6).

Child-care settings are an increasingly important social environment in which food-related behaviors develop, since up to 60% of young children are cared for in these settings and, thus, eat outside of their parents’ care(7). Head Start (HS) is a federal child-care program that provides comprehensive services to preschool-age children and their families who have income below the federal poverty level(8). Head Start programs are expected to encourage family-style meal service to allow children to: 1) identify and be introduced to new foods, tastes, and new menus; 2) choose the amount of food they want to have on their plate; and, 3) practice good table manners and new skills with their hands and fingers(9).

Child-care feeding practices have important implications for the development of eating patterns, including practices involving portion size; however, little is known about the characteristics of the eating environment and its potential effect on weight status(10). Young children demonstrate self-regulation of short-term energy intake; however, environmental cues regarding food intake can override this ability(11–13). Exposure to large portion sizes is one strong environmental cue that is positively associated with increased energy intake in population-based and experimental studies of children(11, 14–20).

Large portion sizes may contribute to the high prevalence of overweight among children by promoting excessive intake at meals(11, 17–21). Studies have shown that increased portion sizes of energy dense foods promoted increased intake of those foods and were positively related to body weight(14, 16, 22). The effects of large portions on intake may extend to fruits and vegetables (FV) and encourage increased consumption(23, 24). Children’s intake of FV remains low and does not meet the daily recommendation(25, 26). That FV intake has been inversely related to body weight in some adult studies, suggests that low intake might also place children at increased risk for obesity, as well as for cancer and other chronic diseases later in life(27).

More studies are needed to better understand factors that influence portion sizes of a variety of foods, in an effort to decrease the excessive intake of energy dense foods and increase the consumption of FV(28–30). Little is known about food portions served and the amount of plate waste in meals served to young children in day care. It is unknown whether variations in FV portion sizes have a beneficial effect on children’s intake of those foods. The primary goal of this study was to examine the variability in the portions of foods served and consumed by African-American (AA) and Hispanic-American (HA) preschool aged children attending HS. A secondary goal was to examine whether child characteristics were associated with the amount of total food served and consumed by the children at the lunch meal.

EXPERIMENTAL METHODS
Lunch Meals at Head Start
All participating HS Centers provided family-style lunch meals where children served themselves the food offered at that meal. In rare occasions the teacher helped with serving the food to the children. The kinds of foods served at the lunch menu were required to meet minimum standards recommended in the Child and Adult Care Food Program (CACFP)(31) meal pattern requirements. Given that the children served themselves, the amount of food served and consumed by each child varied. Thus, the amounts served reflected the self-service amounts.

Food Consumed
Digital photography(32) was used to measure three days of lunch meal intake for each child participating in the study. To examine the types of foods that were offered and consumed, foods were categorized into six different food groups (entrées, starches, vegetables, fruit, beverages, and condiments). Prior to lunch, the children were briefly told that the research staff would be taking pictures of the food on their plate. For the diet assessment, the plate of food was photographed with a digital camera, and any second servings and plate waste were also photographed during or after the meal. The foods were photographed with a digital camera mounted on a tripod with the lens two feet above and two feet away from the center of the meal plate with a camera angle of 45 degrees. A place mat with marked regions for placement of the meal plate was fixed to the table supporting the camera tripod to ensure optimal visibility of the meal plate. The same camera angle and distance from foods were used throughout so that the apparent size of all foods remained constant across the photographs. While in the dining location, photographs of weighed reference portions of the food choices available to the children on each day of data collection were also taken(33). The reference portion of foods was the standard used to determine the amount of foods that were on the filed plates.

In the laboratory, a computer application was used to simultaneously display the digital photographs of the reference portions and meal plate showing either food selection or plate waste. Trained research staff estimated the percent of the reference portion of the food selections, any second helpings, and plate waste.

The trained estimators were not the same staff who did the nutrient coding. To derive the energy and nutrient content for each food served in the HS centers during this study, foods were coded using the Nutrition Data System-Research (NDSR) (NDS version 2006, Nutrition Coordinating Center, University of Minnesota). The HS staff provided recipes, labels and preparation of food items. For mixed dishes, an attempt was made to match the food to a similar food item in NDSR. If no match was available, the components of the recipe were coded. The food groups used in this study reflect the CACFP meal pattern requirements(31) for those specific food groups. For each food item, the nutrient content was expressed per gram (g) and was multiplied by the gram weight for portion size, plate waste, and food intake for each child. Results for macronutrients in each food’s portion size, plate waste, and intake were downloaded and merged with other variables in the master database.

The digital photography method has been found to be reliable and accurate when used to measure the food intake of preschool children. Mean differences between directly weighing foods and the digital photography method ranges from &lt;6 g to 11 g and agreement was consistently high among the research staff who estimate portion sizes and overall portion size estimates highly correlate with weighed portion sizes (r values ranged from 0.77 to 0.96)(33).

Anthropometrics
Duplicate heights and weights were obtained following a standardized protocol which included quality control procedures(34). Heights and weights of the teachers and children were obtained by trained research staff at the HS center and the average values were used in the study.

Demographics
A demographic questionnaire (e.g. age, ethnicity) was completed by the teachers at the HS center. For the children, both the research staff and the teachers mutually completed the demographics questionnaire for each child participant.

Statistical Analyses
All statistical analyses were run using the Statistical Analysis Software (SAS) (version 9.2, SAS Institute Inc Cary, NC, 2008). Weight and height status of the children were measured and body mass indices (BMI) were calculated as weight [kg]/height [m2] and converted to age and gender appropriate BMI z-scores or percentiles from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention Reference Standards(35).

Means and standard deviations, as well as frequency distribution of participant characteristics, and the amount of food served, plate waste, and the amount of food consumed were calculated and then averaged for each food group (fruits, vegetables, entrées, milk, condiments, and starches) and for all foods together. Energy density was defined as mean calorie content per weight of food (kJ/g) consumed at the lunch meal. Post hoc comparisons for total energy from food intake and total amount of food consumed were examined across energy density tertiles. Plots and histograms of residuals were used to investigate homogeneity of variance and normal distribution of variables. A p&lt;0.05 was considered statistically significant. A Bonferroni correction was used to adjust the significance level for multiple comparisons.

Multi-level modeling was necessary to account for cluster effects and to provide greater efficiency because the children were nested within teachers/classrooms, and teachers/classroom was nested within schools/centers. Three-level hierarchical models were performed to assess whether selected demographic characteristics of the children were associated with the amount of food served, plate waste, and intake. Demographic characteristics included gender, ethnicity/race, age, and BMI z-score as first level (children), while teachers’ characteristics included ethnicity/race, age, and BMI as second level, and schools/centers as third level.

RESULTS
The study included preschool children (n=796) attending HS (51% boys, 42% AA and 58% HA). Thirty-nine percent of the children were overweight or obese. The children were recruited from 149 classrooms within 16 HS centers in Houston, Texas. Consent forms were sent home with the children for parents to sign for their child (passive consent). Active consent was received for the teachers participating in the study.

The mean amount of food in lunch meals served and consumed by food type is shown in Table 1. The mean amount of food/milk served was 572 (58% food). The mean amount of food/milk plate waste was 240 g; thus, 331g were consumed. The mean amounts of food/milk served to preschoolers at the lunch meal was comparable to the CACFP requirements(31): 2.54 ounces for the entrée (meat/meat alternate), 0.77 ounces for the starch (grains/bread), 0.59 cups for the vegetables, 0.54 cups for the fruit, and, 1.07 cups for the milk food components (data not shown). However, the CV of the amount of food/milk served by food type varied considerably: 44% vegetables, 76% starch, 8% milk, 33% entrée, and 60% fruit. Only 57% of the total food served was actually consumed. Plate waste was highest for vegetables (61%) and lowest for fruit (38%) and entrée (39%). The energy density of the food served and consumed was highest for entrées and starches and lowest for fruit and milk.

The macronutrient composition of the lunch meal served and consumed is shown in Table 2. The mean energy intake from the lunch meal was 1421 kJ (339 kcal). The macronutrient percent of total energy was: 21% protein, 46% carbohydrate, and 34% fat. Figure 1 shows a distribution of the total amount of food served with the total amount of food consumed. There was a significant (p&lt;0.0001) linear increase in the food served and the amount of food consumed (Figure 1). This was true for all food categories. There was a significant (r=0.43, p&lt;0.001) correlation between the total amount served and amount consumed ranging from 0.71 (vegetables, p&lt;0.0001) to 0.80 (starches, p&lt;0.0001).

There were significant linear relationships between total energy intake from food, energy density, and the amount of food consumed by the children at the lunch meal (Figure 2). For the lowest tertile of energy density of total food consumed, there was a significantly lower total energy intake from food (p&lt;0.0001) and a significantly higher total amount of food consumed (p&lt;0.0001), compared to the middle-to-upper energy density tertiles.

There were several child characteristics associated with the amount of total food served and consumed at the lunch meal (Table 3). African-American children served themselves more food than HA children (p = 0.007), and consumed significantly higher food intakes (p=0.0014). Although the amount of food the children served themselves did not vary by BMI, the heavier children were more likely to consume larger amounts of food (p trend &lt;0.0001). There was a linear increase in the total amount of food consumed by age (p trend &lt;0.0001). The oldest children (5 y) consumed 106 g more of food than the youngest children (3 y).

There was considerable variation in the mean amount of food/milk served at the lunch meal across the 16 HS centers (Figure 3). The mean amount of food/milk served ranged from 228–503 g with an intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC) of 0.47. The variation in the mean amount consumed across 16 HS centers was much smaller. Mean intake ranged from 132–255 g with an ICC of 0.14.

DISCUSSION
To our knowledge this is the first study to evaluate lunch meals by the amounts served to and consumed by preschool children in HS. Specifically, the amount of foods served was evaluated together with child characteristics as potential predictors for the amount of foods consumed. On average, the mean amount of foods/milk served to preschoolers at the lunch meal was comparable to the CACFP requirements. However, the variation in the amount of foods served and consumed was substantial, particularly across the 16 HS centers. Plate waste of the HS lunch meal was very high with 43% of total food served not being consumed.

There was a significant correlation between the amount of food served and the amount consumed. This is consistent with the literature that children who received a larger portion of food consumed more food than if they received a smaller portion(11, 17–20). Children 3–5 y consumed 25% more of an entrée and 15% more total energy at lunch when presented with portions that were double an age-appropriate standard size(17). Despite the amount of food wasted, results suggested that larger portions resulted in increased intake. Food portions served have been positively related to body weight of 1 y children, where children with higher body weights consumed on the average, larger portions(14). Similar results were found in this study, in that obese children were more likely to consume larger amounts of food.

Intake of an entrée has been shown to be greater with large portions than with self-selected portions(17, 20). However, in this study the portions served to the child were all self-selected portions but these varied considerably. Children generally selected portions of food that was equivalent to, or greater than, the minimum portion sizes specified in the CACFP meal pattern requirements(36). Children generally consumed between 70 to 75% of the portions of food taken at lunch. Different types of foods were consumed in varying proportions, with 73% of the milk being consumed and only 59% of the vegetables(36). The wide range of children’s observed self-served portion sizes suggest that allowing children to self-serve may be less beneficial to some children than to others since increased amounts of foods served was associated with increased intakes. This was true for the energy dense foods but not the case with fruits and vegetables.

Total energy intake significantly increased with increased energy density of the total food consumed. Children who ate the lunch meal with the lowest energy density (Tertile 1) consumed 925 kJ (221 kcal) compared to those in the upper tertile who consumed 1227 kJ (293 kcal). An effect of meal energy density on energy intake is consistent with experimental and population-based studies of energy density in children(28–30). Further, in this study total food intake (in g) was also negatively associated meal energy density, consistent with relationships reported in the Feeding Infants and Toddlers Study between energy density and food portions consumed(37). Highly controlled experimental studies of energy density in children have demonstrated that the weight of food intake is not substantially altered by systematic changes to energy density such that children consume greater amounts of energy intakes when more energy dense versions of foods are served(29, 30, 38). Taken together, the findings of this research suggest that HS children consume more energy at school meals when more energy-dense meals are offered.

Another key finding was the influence of age, ethnicity, and BMI on portion size and young children’s intake at the lunch meal. African-American children served themselves a larger amount of food compared to HA children resulting in significantly higher intakes. Older children consumed more total amount of food than younger children. The obese children consumed more total food than the overweight and normal weight children, despite the finding that there was no difference in the amount that was served by weight status. In one study, the tendency to consume more when served large portions was not influenced by age, ethnicity, or BMI(13). However, population based studies suggest that family demographics, including income, ethnicity, and education may influence the extent to which children prefer and consume large portions(14, 39).

The mean energy and macronutrients of the lunch meal consumed is similar to levels reported for children 2–5 y from national surveys(40). Preschool children consumed an average of 340 kcals from the lunch meal and the percentage of protein, carbohydrate, and fat did not exceed the Institute of Medicine’s Acceptable Macronutrient Distribution Ranges(41). A recent national survey showed that, on average, children in HS consumed adequate amounts of all key nutrients studied(42). However, compared to other low-income children of the same age, HS children were at greater risk for not meeting the Recommended Dietary Allowances for total daily intake of thiamin, riboflavin, niacin, and calcium. Other studies have evaluated food intake of children at child-care centers(43, 44). They found that children 3 y consumed sufficient fruits and meat/alternates, but insufficient grains, vegetables, or dairy to meet two-thirds of the Food Guide Pyramid for young children recommendations. The children 4- and 5-y only consumed the recommended amounts of dairy.

In this study, the amount of food consumed by children at the HS lunch meal was assessed with a more precise method than dietary methods used in other studies(33, 45–47). The digital photography method has been used in a number of settings and its reliability and validity have been established in adults(45, 48, 49), school-age(47, 48, 50) and preschool(33) children. Portion size estimates correlate highly with weighed portion sizes(45) and mean differences between directly weighed foods and digital photography estimates were minimal (&lt; 6 grams) with no systematic bias over levels of food intake(45). These results are consistent with those shown specifically with preschool children(33). In the NHANES, intakes of preschool children were assessed with parents serving as a proxy for their child’s intake. Older studies have shown that parental recalls of preschool children’s intake is a valid measure(51, 52); however, more recent studies show that parental recalls may over-estimate what a child is consuming outside the home in daycare(51–53).

Our study found that the energy intake of the lunch meal consumed by children in the NHANES was comparable to what was actually served to the children in daycare. Yet, with 43% plate waste found in the lunch meal at daycare, children’s energy intake from the lunch meal was actually 42% lower than the amount of energy served.

LIMITATIONS
Use of a convenience sample, such as the one used in this study, has several inherent limitations including that the results may not be representative of preschool children outside the Houston HS population and may be difficult to duplicate. Another limitation is that information on caregivers’ behaviors related to child self-service was not collected and may have influenced the variability in the results. Data was also not collected on the menus across the sixteen HS centers or on the demographic composition of the classrooms. Lack of consistency in the menus or differences in classroom compositions may have contributed to the variability in the amount of food consumed across the centers. Conducting digital photography in the HS center may be viewed as intrusive with the potential of influencing the typical consumption of lunch meals and the environment surrounding the lunch meals. However, there was a large amount of variation in the amount of food served and plate waste suggesting that the children’s eating behavior at the lunch meal was not altered. The amount of variability captured in food intake using this unobtrusive method has been shown in other studies(33, 46–48, 50, 54). The method is limited in terms of the environment in which it can be used. It has been used only to assess lunch and dinner meals in a child care or home setting and does not translate in measuring the real life 24-hour dietary intake of preschool children. This method can serve as a methodological foundation for incorporating more technological innovations(55), such as cell phones using computer imaging algorithms(47, 56), for reducing burden on the respondents and research staff and to measure food intake in near real time in free living conditions(50, 54).

CONCLUSION
Findings from this study showed that plate waste was high. Variation in the amounts served and consumed was substantial and the amounts served were positively associated with the amounts consumed. Finally, child characteristics influenced the amount of food served to and consumed by preschool children. Given that large portion sizes may contribute to the high prevalence of overweight among children by promoting excessive intake at meals, teaching preschool children how to serve themselves appropriately sized amounts of food may help prevent obesity and reduce food waste
