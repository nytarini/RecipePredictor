        Dro&#xEB;wors are traditional South African salted and dried sausages, made without nitrites/nitrates and non- fermented. Different meat sources (beef, game and ostrich) are traditionally used in dro&#xEB;wors processing, while the use of pork is uncommon, as it is said to lead to rancidity. The first part of the study analysed the physico-chemical composition of commercially available beef, game and ostrich meat dro&#xEB;wors (n&#x2009;=&#x2009;20). On average, they were composed of 26.3&#x2013;29.2&#xA0;g/100&#xA0;g moisture, 41.3&#x2013;44.0&#xA0;g/100&#xA0;g protein, 26.2&#x2013;33.1&#xA0;g/100&#xA0;g fat and 5.9&#x2013;6.5&#xA0;g/100&#xA0;g ash and 5.0&#x2013;5.4 pH. Water activity (0.76&#x2013;0.82) was sufficiently low to ensure shelf stability at ambient temperatures. In the second part beef and pork dro&#xEB;wors were formulated in accordance with these results and with similar fat content, dried for 2&#xA0;days (30&#xA0;&#xB0;C, 40% relative humidity) and stored for 26&#xA0;days (25&#xA0;&#xB0;C, 50% relative humidity); measuring moisture, water activity, pH and lipid oxidative stability (thiobarbituric acid reactive substances (TBARS)) weekly. At day 5, moisture and thus water activity of pork dro&#xEB;wors was slightly higher compared to beef ones and fat and ash content slightly lower (P&#x2009;&#x2264;&#x2009;0.05) despite similar weight loss. Even with slightly less fat, TBARS in pork dro&#xEB;wors were significantly higher after drying and throughout storage (3.83 vs 0.99&#xA0;mg MDA equivalents/kg dry matter at a maximum).
