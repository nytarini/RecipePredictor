f insects as food by humans, is
increasing due to the need for protein combined with increasing animal protein
costs, food and feed insecurity, environmental issues, and population growth (Looy et al., 2014). More than 1,900 species,
including beetles, caterpillars (Lepidoptera), bees/wasps/ants (Hymenoptera),
grasshoppers/locusts/crickets (Orthoptera), cicadas/leafhoppers/planthoppers/scale
insects/true bugs (Hemiptera), termites (Isoptera), dragonflies (Odonata), and flies
(Diptera), have traditionally been used as food sources in some parts of the world
(van Huis et al., 2013). Insects are a
valuable sustainable food with ample energy content and high levels of protein,
beneficial amino acids (leucine, isoleucine, and lysine), and unsaturated fatty
acids (oleic acid, linoleic acid, and palmitic acid), minerals (copper, iron,
magnesium, manganese, phosphorous, selenium, and zinc), and essential vitamins
(vitamins A, B complex, and C) (Bukkens, 1997;
Finke, 2002; Murefu et al., 2019; Tang et
al., 2018). It was recently estimated that at least 2 billion people
consume insects on a regular basis (van Huis et al.,
2013) because of their nutritive value and their characteristic
flavor.
      Tenebrio molitor, whose larvae are known as mealworms, is a species
of darkling beetle popularly consumed in Asia (Pal
and Roy, 2014; Zhang and Zhao,
2019). It was recently accepted as a food ingredient by the Ministry of
Food and Drug Safety in Korea, following promulgation of the Act on Fosterage and
Support of the Insect Industry in 2010 (Yun and
Hwang, 2016). Numerous studies have examined the nutritional components
of mealworms, and their safety, functionality, and utilization (Baek et al., 2019; Borremans et al., 2018; Francis
et al., 2019; Murefu et al., 2019;
Parodi et al., 2018). However, the use of
mealworms, like most edible insects, as a food source remains somewhat limited
because many people are averse to their physical appearance. Therefore, most insects
have been used in crushed or powdered forms as food additives (Seo and Cho, 2018). They can also be used as the main
ingredients of seasoning or flavoring materials after suitable reaction processes,
because they are rich reservoirs with suitable aroma characteristics (Finke, 2002; Parodi et al., 2018). Therefore, basic information on their aroma
profiles is necessary before their application. Recently, Kroncke et al. (2019) compared the nutrient qualities and
volatiles of mealworms using different drying methods. However, there is still
little information on their aroma profiles either raw or after cooking.
      Therefore, this study profiled the aroma components and sensory attributes of
mealworms, comparing the aroma characteristics of raw and cooked samples, and
examined the differences in their aroma properties according to cooking methods
(i.e., raw, steamed, roasted, and fried).

      Materials and Methods

        Sample preparation
        Live mealworms at the 9th larval stage (under non-fasting condition)
were purchased from a local market (MG-Natural, Damyang, Korea), separated from
wheat bran, and stored in a deep-freezer at &#x2212;70&#xB0;C until use. Raw
and cooked mealworms were prepared (i.e., steamed in boiling water for 30 min,
roasted in a convection oven (EDF 213 XPT, ESCO, Eski&#x15F;ehir, Turkey) at
180&#xB0;C for 5 min, or deep-fried (DKR-113, Delki, Goyang, Korea) in soybean
oil at 180&#xB0;C for 3 min) and then placed in a mortar, frozen in liquid
nitrogen, and ground to powder.

        Extraction of aroma components
        Ground mealworms (30 g) were mixed with 0.1 mL of benzyl acetate (200 ppm in
diethyl ether) as an internal standard and extracted with 150 mL of re-distilled
diethyl ether at 300 rpm for 30 min. They were separated using a centrifuge
(Combi-514R, Hanil, Gimpo, Korea) at 1,000&#xD7;g and 4&#xB0;C for 10 min,
and the supernatants were filtered under a vacuum. Aroma components were then
separated from the non-volatiles by solvent-assisted flavor evaporation (SAFE)
with an operating vacuum that was typically below
5&#xD7;10&#x2212;5 Torr. The extract was dehydrated over
anhydrous sodium sulfate, evaporated on a Vigreux column in a water bath at
40&#xB1;2&#xB0;C, and then concentrated under a slow stream of nitrogen gas
to obtain a final volume of 0.1 mL.

        Gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS)
        GC-MS analysis was performed using an Agilent 7980B gas chromatography-5977B mass
selective detector (Agilent Technologies, Palo Alto, CA, USA) equipped with an
HP-5MS column (30 m length&#xD7;0.25 mm i.d.&#xD7;0.25 mm film thickness).
The carrier gas was helium at a constant flow rate of 0.8 mL/min. One microliter
of the extract was injected in the split ratio (10:1) mode. The oven was started
at 40&#xB0;C for 5 min, increased to 200&#xB0;C at a rate of 4&#xB0;C
/min, and held at 200&#xB0;C for 10 min. The injector and detector
temperatures were 250&#xB0;C and 230&#xB0;C, respectively. The mass detector
was operated in electron ionization mode with an ionization energy of 70 eV and
a scan range of 50 and 550 a.m.u.

        Identification and quantification of aroma components
        Aroma components were identified based on comparison of their mass spectra with
those of the NIST 17 (ver. 2.2) and Wiley 7.0 databases or by manual
interpretation. Retention index (RI) values were compared with those reported
previously (Adams, 2007; Babushok et al., 2011; Bianchi et al., 2007; Kang
et al., 2016). The RIs of volatiles were calculated using
n-alkanes (C7&#x2013;C22) as external
references. Semiquantitative analysis of aroma components was performed by
comparing their peak areas to that of the internal standard compound (0.1 mL of
200 ppm benzyl acetate in diethyl ether, v/v) on the GC-MS total ion
chromatogram.

        Sensory evaluation
        To evaluate sensory aroma attributes perceived in raw and cooked mealworms,
sensory aroma profiling modified from flavor profiling (Stampanoni, 1994) was performed (IRB No.
WKIRB-201903-HR-014). Ten subjects (female, 21&#x2013;25 years of age) who
previously participated in descriptive analyses in the Department of Food
Science and Biotechnology at Wonkwang University were selected and trained until
they could reliably discriminate among aroma attributes: shrimp-like (aroma
associated with shrimp snacks), wet-soil-like (aroma associated with damp soil),
oily (aroma associated with fresh olive oil), roasted (aroma associated with
baked cookies), sweet-corn-like (aroma associated with sweet corn), and
fried-oil-like (aroma associated with oil fried once or twice). Each subject was
given 5 g of each sample in a porcelain container (8 cm i.d.&#xD7;4.5 cm
height). All samples were coded with random three-digit numbers. The intensities
of attributes perceived in each sample were evaluated on a 9-point intensity
scale, ranging from &#x201C;weak&#x201D; (score of 1) to &#x201C;strong&#x201D;
(score of 9).

        Statistical analysis
        Analysis of variance (ANOVA) using SPSS software (ver. 24.0; IBM, Armonk, NY,
USA) was performed for statistical evaluation of the differences in the aroma
compositions of raw mealworms and those treated with different cooking methods.
The results of Duncan&#x2019;s multi-range test were evaluated at p&lt;0.05
significance level. The values of aroma components are presented as the
mean&#xB1;SD of three replicates. Partial least squares regression (PLSR) was
used to determine the relationship between instrumental and sensory data sets,
performed with SIMCA-P (ver. 11.0; Umetrics, Ume&#xE5;, Sweden).

      Results and Discussion

        Aroma components of raw and cooked mealworms
        The aroma components of raw and cooked mealworms were extracted using SAFE and
then analyzed by GC-MS. Table 1 lists the
aroma components identified in mealworms, their relative peak areas, and their
RIs on the HP-5ms column. In total, 46 aroma components were found in the
mealworms, including four pyrazines, three pyrrolidines, three aldehydes, six
ketones, five alcohols, three acids and esters, and 22 hydrocarbons. The aromas
of raw mealworms were primarily composed of hydrocarbons (50.11%) and
aldehydes (37.14%). In particular, 4-methylbenzaldehyde (no. 10) was the
most prevalent individual component in raw mealworms and increased in steamed
and roasted mealworms. Pyrazines, pyrrolidines, and carbonyls were increased or
newly appeared in cooked mealworms (especially with roasting and frying),
although there were some quantitative and qualitative differences among cooking
methods. These components can be generated through a complex series of thermal
reactions, including Maillard or non-enzymatic browning reactions between
reducing sugars and amino acids, thermal degradation of lipids, and
decomposition of sugars, and their interactions, which then produce the
characteristic flavors differentiated from those of raw mealworms (Amrani-Hemaimi et al., 1995; Schenker et al., 2002).

        Sensory aroma attributes of raw and cooked mealworms
        In this study, ten trained panelists described the sensory aroma attributes of
raw and cooked mealworms. Six sensory aroma attributes were perceived in raw and
cooked mealworms: oily, shrimp-like, wet-soil-like, roasted, sweet-corn-like,
and fried-oil-like aroma attributes; the mean intensities of each attribute are
shown in Fig. 1. The intensities of the
attributes differed significantly among mealworms (p&lt;0.05). Raw mealworms
had a strong wet-soil-like odor and less-intense oily, shrimp-like, and
sweet-corn-like aroma attributes. In comparison, steamed mealworms had a strong
sweet-corn-like aroma attribute, and weak shrimp-like and wet-soil-like aroma
attributes. The intensities of two sensory attributes (e.g., roasted and
shrimp-like) were noticeably increased in roasted mealworms, whereas strong
fried-oil-like and roasted aroma attributes were major in fried mealworms.

        Relationship between aroma compositions and sensory aroma attributes of raw
and cooked mealworms
        Multivariate statistical techniques can be used to extract, organize, and
visualize statistically interpretable and reliable data information. In
particular, PLSR can be used to establish the relationship between two datasets
by predicting one (X) from the other (Y)
(Dijksterhuis, 1994). In this study,
the PLSR model calculated the cross-validation based on 46 aroma components
(x variable) and six sensory aroma attributes
(y variable) analyzed in raw and cooked mealworms and then
visualized the differences among raw and cooked mealworms (Fig. 2). It is also possible to understand which variables
carry class-separating information and which variables are mainly associated
with samples (Ledauphin et al., 2010;
Zhang et al., 2013). Fig. 2 shows the distributions of raw and
cooked mealworms based on the first and second PLS components of the PLSR plot.
Raw and steamed mealworms were located on the negative PC 1 axis, whereas
roasted and fried ones were on the positive PC 1 axis. Fried
vs. roasted and raw vs. steamed mealworms
were further separated along the PC 2 axis. Fried and raw mealworms were located
on the positive PC 2, whereas steamed and roasted ones were on the negative PC 2
axis. The first PLS component was mainly defined by the aroma descriptors and
contrasted shrimp-like, fried-oil-like, roasted, and oily aroma attributes on
the positive dimension and wet soil-like and sweet-corn-like aroma attributes on
the negative dimension. In particular, fried and roasted mealworms were
evaluated as possessing strong shrimp-like, roasted, and fried-oily like
attributes. By contrast, wet soil-like and sweet-corn-like attributes were
strongly correlated with raw and steamed mealworms, respectively. In addition,
2,3-dimethyl-heptane (no. 28), bis(2-methylpropyl)-hexanedioate (no. 22),
2-butoxy-ethanol (no. 18), and ethyl-benzene (no. 29), were related to
wet-soil-like aroma attributes, which were close to raw mealworms. In
comparison, 2,4,6-trimethyl-heptane (no. 32), 2,4-dimethyl-dodecane (no. 42),
and 3,5-dihydroxy-6-methyl-2,3-dihydropyran-4-one (no. 14) were associated with
sweet-corn-like odor notes. 2,6-Dimethyl-pyrazine (no. 1), heptan-2-one (no.
11), 2,3,5-trimethyl-pyrazine (no. 4), and 1-butyl-pyrrolidine (no. 5) were
correlated with the sensory attribute of shrimp-like odor, whereas
1-(1-pentenyl)-pyrrolidine (no. 7), pentan-1-ol (no. 17), oct-2-ene (no. 26),
1-(2-methyl-1-butenyl)-pyrrolidine (no. 6), 2,6,11-trimethyl-dodecane (no. 45)
were responsible for fried-oil-like aroma characteristics. 2,5-Dimethyl-pyrazine
(no. 2), oct-1-one-3-ol (no. 18), 2-ethyl-5-metyl-pyrazine (no. 3), and
benzaldehyde (no. 8) were associated with roasted sensory attributes. In
general, raw meat (or seafood) has little aroma and only blood-like (or fresh
fish-like) taste. However, it has lots of nonvolatile precursors of muscle
flavor including free amino acids, peptides, reducing sugars, vitamins, and
nucleotides. The interaction of nonvolatile precursors with one another and/or
their degradation products, via the Maillard reaction and lipid
degradation during thermal processing, produces a large number of aroma
components which contribute to the development of desirable aroma of cooked
meat/or seafood (Shahidi, 1998). In
particular, pyrazines, pyridines, thiophenes, thiazoles, thiazolines, and
Strecker aldehydes which contributing to the roasted aroma characteristics
derive from the Maillard reaction, whereas those responsible for species aroma
characteristics are formed from lipid degradation (alcohol, aldehyde, ketones,
and furans) (Amrani-Hemaimi et al., 1995;
Schenker et al., 2002; Shahidi, 1998). In our study, pyrazines,
pyrrolidines, and aldehydes were produced in cooked mealworms. They have been
known as major savory-type (e.g., meaty, roasted, baked, popcorn-like, and so
on) aroma components (Amrani-Hemaimi et al.,
1995; Schenker et al., 2002;
Shahidi, 1998). However, pyrazines
were dominant only in roasted and fried mealworms, but not detected in boiled
ones. According to previous study, the substituted pyrazines were main products
from thermal reactions (especially Maillard reaction), and decreased as the
water content increase (Eichner and Karel,
1972; Lu et al., 2005). In
addition, Mottram (1994) reported that
high temperatures for cooking lead to high formation rate of the rapid oxidation
of unsaturated fatty acids. The major lipid oxidation components (e.g.,
pentan-1-ol and oct-1en-3-ol) in our study were also more found in roasted and
deep-fried ones.

      Conclusion
      The sensory aroma attributes of raw mealworms had strong wet-soil-like notes and less
intense oily, shrimp-like, and sweet-corn-like notes. Hydrocarbons with solvent-like
aroma note and aldehydes described as sweet and roasted aroma characteristic were
the major aroma components in raw mealworms. The cook-treatments (e.g., steaming,
roasting, and frying) increased the intensities of roasted, fried-oil-like, and
sweet-corn-like aroma attributes of mealworms. Specifically, nitrogen-containing
heterocyclic components (e.g., pyrazines and pyrrolidines) and carbonyls contributed
to those aroma attributes and were associated with their differences. Raw mealworms
are rich in Maillard reaction precursors and their changes in the aroma compositions
during thermal processing were similar to those of meat or seafood. Therefore, basic
information on their aroma profiles should be valuable in the application of
flavoring materials as main ingredients.
