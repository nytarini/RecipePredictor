    Energy balance-related habits (i.e. dietary intake, physical activity and sedentary
behaviour) originate in early childhood and track into later life(

1

,

2

). Parents can have a strong influence on these habits by the parenting practices
they use(

3

). Parenting practices are content-specific acts of parenting(

4

), and include setting rules about dietary intake or activity behaviour, acting as
a role model, and educating children about food and physical activity(

5

&#x2013;

8

).
    Various reviews have summarized the many studies regarding the influence of parenting
practices on children&#x2019;s dietary intake (e.g. references 9 and 10) and physical activity and
sedentary behaviour (e.g. reference 11). With regard
to food-related parenting practices(

9

), instrumental and emotional feeding, in which food is used to change children&#x2019;s
behaviour or mood, seem less effective or sometimes show undesirable effects. Stimulating
healthy intake seems to be a more promising approach. Also with regard to physical
activity(

11

), supportive and encouraging parenting practices seem to hold the most promising
results. In line with the growing number of studies examining energy balance-related
parenting, there are also numerous instruments to assess food-related(

12

) and activity-related(

11

,

13

,

14

) parenting, including various validated instruments.
    However, an increasing number of children are attending non-parental child care for one or
more days per week; more than half of European toddlers attend child-care or pre-school
education facilities(

15

). In view of the increasing child-care use, various authors have called for
increased attention to the influence of child-care staff practices on children&#x2019;s energy
balance-related behaviour(

16

&#x2013;

19

). Child-care use is associated with an increased overweight risk throughout
childhood(

20

,

21

). Moreover, differences between children&#x2019;s dietary intake, physical activity and
sedentary behaviour can be partially attributed to the child-care centre or the pre-school the
child is attending(

22

,

23

). However, a limited number of studies have examined the association between
child-care practices and children&#x2019;s nutrition. For instance, we recently showed(

24

) that children ate more vegetables when child-care staff encouraged them. Children
ate more fruit and less sweet snacks when staff involved them in food preparation(

24

). Other studies have shown beneficial effects of staff modelling healthy food
intake or talking about healthy food(

25

), or combining these practices by using enthusiastic modelling, in which staff
verbally confirmed that the food they tasted, tasted good(

26

). As regards physical activity, encouragement of physical activity by staff has
been linked to increased activity levels(

19

,

27

). Findings with regard to child-care staff&#x2019;s initiation of and participation in
play are mixed(

27

,

28

).
    A recent review of physical activity and healthy eating environmental audit tools in youth
care settings indicated that there are a handful of audit tools for the child-care
setting(

29

). However, most of these instruments focus mainly on the physical child-care
environment or child-care policies. Staff&#x2019;s food-related and activity-related practices are
included in some instruments, although this concerns only a limited selection of practices
(e.g. references 30 and 31). Hughes et al. have developed a questionnaire to
assess child-care staff&#x2019;s feeding styles, which are conceptually different from specific
food-related practices(

32

). In addition, Dev and colleagues have used parenting practices instruments to
assess child-care staff&#x2019;s food-related practices(

33

,

34

), although these were not validated for the child-care setting. To our knowledge,
validated questionnaires to specifically assess the broad range of child-care staff&#x2019;s
food-related and activity-related practices in detail are not yet available.
    The lack of such questionnaires to specifically assess child-care staff practices is a large
contrast to the abundance of questionnaires to assess parenting practices and reflects the gap
between our knowledge regarding practices in both settings (home and child care)(

24

). Therefore, the aim of the current study was to develop and validate a
questionnaire to measure food-related and activity-related practices of child-care staff,
based on existing, validated parenting practices questionnaires.

      Methods

        Questionnaire selection
        Two parenting practices questionnaires were selected for conversion to the child-care
setting: the Comprehensive Feeding Practices Questionnaire (CFPQ) of Musher-Eizenman and
Holub(

35

) assessing food-related parenting practices; and the Preschooler Physical
Activity Parenting Practices (PPAPP) questionnaire of O&#x2019;Connor et
al.(

36

) assessing activity-related practices. The selection was done by three of the
authors of the current paper (J.S.G., E.F.C.S. and S.P.J.K.), who are experts in the field
of parenting and/or child care. The questionnaires were selected based on previous studies
using parenting practices instruments in the child-care setting(

33

,

34

), the findings of recent reviews of parenting practices
instruments(

11

&#x2013;

14

) and an additional literature review to find any questionnaires published
after these reviews. Criteria for the selection of the questionnaires were the validity
and suitability of the questionnaire for the age group (0&#x2013;4 years old) and the suitability
of the item content for translation to the child-care setting. All decisions were made
through extensive author review meetings.
        The CFPQ has been previously used to assess child-care staff&#x2019;s food-related practices in
the child-care setting by Dev and colleagues(

33

,

34

). However, they applied the original scales of the parenting
version(

35

) to their child-care version(

33

,

34

). Building on the work of Dev et al. and the considerations
above, we decided to select the CFPQ for the current validation study. The CFPQ is partly
based on one of the most widely used scales in the child feeding literature: the Child
Feeding Questionnaire (CFQ), developed by Birch et al.(

37

). However, because the CFQ did not fully capture the range of food-related
practices, the CFPQ was developed(

35

). The CFPQ assesses food parenting practices using forty-nine items divided
over twelve scales (see online supplementary material, Supplemental Table 1): Child
control, Emotion regulation, Encourage balance and variety, Environment, Food as reward,
Involvement, Modelling, Monitoring, Pressure to eat, Restriction for health, Restriction
for weight control and Teaching about nutrition. All items are answered using a 5-point
Likert scale ranging from &#x2018;never&#x2019; to &#x2018;always&#x2019; for the questions and from &#x2018;disagree&#x2019; to
&#x2018;agree&#x2019; for the statements. The validation studies of the CFPQ show good fit of the final
model, with Cronbach&#x2019;s &#x3B1; ranging from 0&#xB7;58 to 0&#xB7;81(

35

). The items of the CFPQ were independently translated to Dutch by four of the
authors (J.S.G., E.F.C.S., L.C.H.R. and J.M.G.). In the case of disagreement, the fifth
author (S.P.J.K.) was involved to decide on the final item.
        The PPAPP measures activity-related parenting practices using thirty-two items on two
main scales: Encouraging physical activity (seventeen items) and Discouraging physical
activity (fifteen items)(

36

) (see online supplementary material, Supplemental Table 2). The Encouraging
and Discouraging scales are split up further in various subscales and single items. The
Encouraging scale includes the Engagement subscale and two single items. The Discouraging
scale consists of four subscales: Promote inactive transport, Promote screen time,
Psychological control and Restriction for safety concern. Answers are on a 5-point Likert
scale ranging from &#x2018;never&#x2019; to &#x2018;always&#x2019;. Validation studies of the questionnaire showed a
test&#x2013;retest reliability ranging from 0&#xB7;56 to 0&#xB7;85, and Cronbach&#x2019;s &#x3B1;
values between 0&#xB7;50 and 0&#xB7;90(

36

,

38

). A Dutch translation of the PPAPP was already available from a previous
study(

39

). The translation procedure for the PPAPP was in line with that of the CFPQ,
with multiple experts independently translating the questionnaire.

        Questionnaire conversion
        After the CFPQ and PPAPP were selected, their items were reviewed by the present authors
for applicability in the child-care setting. Several items were dropped because they were
not applicable for the child-care setting. For the CFPQ, four items were dropped (see
online supplementary material, Supplemental Table 1), leaving forty-five items. For
instance, &#x2018;I encourage my child to participate in grocery shopping&#x2019; from the Involvement
scale was dropped, as children do not participate in grocery shopping in child-care. For
the PPAPP, five items were dropped (see Supplemental Table 2), leaving twenty-seven items.
An example of an item from the PPAPP that was not applicable was &#x2018;How often do you take
your child to sport practice or game in which he/she is enrolled?&#x2019;
        The remaining items were translated to the child-care setting. In line with the
translation to Dutch, the items were independently translated to the child-care setting by
four of the authors (J.S.G., E.F.C.S., L.C.H.R. and J.M.G.). In the case of disagreement,
the fifth author (S.P.J.K.) was involved to decide on the final item. For most items, the
conversion to the child-care setting simply meant replacing &#x2018;my child&#x2019; by &#x2018;the children&#x2019;.
For instance, &#x2018;I show my child how much I enjoy eating healthy foods&#x2019; was converted to &#x2018;I
show the children how much I enjoy eating healthy foods&#x2019;. For other items, additional
changes had to be made. For instance, &#x2018;How often do you play a sport or active game
together as a family?&#x2019; was changed to &#x2018;How often do you play a sport or active game
together with the children (and perhaps with other child-care staff)?&#x2019;

        Qualitative pre-test
        To pre-test the developed questionnaires, child-care staff were approached to participate
in a cognitive interview. The aim of this cognitive interview was to find errors in the
questionnaire or unsuitable items, including unclear instructions or answer options, that
could influence the outcome of the questions(

40

). For the interviews, thirteen child-care centres in the Netherlands were
contacted via telephone. Four child-care centres agreed to participate and a total of ten
child-care staff members from these four centres were interviewed. The participants were
all female and their age ranged between 20 and 55 years.
        First, the researchers explained the procedure to the participants. During the
interviews, participants were asked to indicate good questions with &#x2018;+&#x2019;, questions that
can be improved with &#x2018;&#x2013;&#x2019;, and with &#x2018;0&#x2019; when they did not have an opinion. When
participants indicated a question with &#x2018;+&#x2019;, it was discussed what was good about the
question. When participants rated a question with &#x2018;&#x2013;&#x2019;, it was discussed what could be
improved about the question. Next, there were some general questions about the clarity of
the instructions and the answer options of the items. Subsequently, the applicability of
some specific items was discussed.
        The interviews were recorded on a voice-recording device. Additionally, the interviewers
took field notes. Based on the outcomes of the interviews, a few additional changes had to
be made to the items. These were mostly minor changes in wording or sentence structure. In
some cases, examples were added to the items for clarification. Furthermore, several
additional items were dropped based on the responses of the interview participants. These
were five items of the CFPQ and four items of the PPAPP (see online supplementary
material, Supplemental Tables 1 and 2). For the CFPQ, five items of the Restriction for
weight control scale were deleted, as the child-care staff could not relate to these
questions; weight control was beyond their influence and beyond their responsibility.
Another example was that all child-care staff indicated that they had an enclosed and
locked playground. The PPAPP questions regarding not letting children play outside because
of worries about traffic, crime or strangers thus were not relevant. Supplemental Tables 1
and 2 show which items were deleted at this stage.
        The combined and converted pilot-test version of the questionnaire, named the Child-care
Food and Activity Practices Questionnaire (CFAPQ), contained sixty-three items: forty
regarding diet and twenty-three regarding physical activity. The items included in the
CFAPQ are shown in online supplementary material, Supplemental Tables 1 and 2.

        Procedure of pilot test
        The pilot-test version of the questionnaire was pilot-tested among a larger sample of
child-care staff. In addition to the CFAPQ items, several items were added regarding
participants&#x2019; demographics. These were the child-care staff&#x2019;s age (18&#x2013;25 years, 26&#x2013;35
years, 36&#x2013;45 years, 46&#x2013;55 years, 56&#x2013;65 years, &gt;65 years), gender, weight (in
kilograms), height (in centimetres), educational level (child-care staff education (in
Dutch: Sociaal Pedagogisch Werker) level 3, 4 or 5), whether they had children themselves,
total number of groups in the child-care centre in which they were working at the time of
the questionnaire, number of years working in the child-care centre in which they were
working at the time of the questionnaire, and total number of years working in the
child-care setting in general.
        A total of 1028 randomly selected child-care centres were approached, mostly via email or
telephone. Email addresses and telephone numbers were obtained from a Dutch national
database of child-care centres and pre-schools (in Dutch: Landelijk Register Kinderopvang
en Peuterspeelzalen(

41

)). Child-care centres had the ability to complete the questionnaire
online(

42

) or to request a paper version, which was sent to them with a prepaid return
envelope. Participants were recruited during April 2014. Data collection took place during
April and May 2014. In total, 256 child-care staff members agreed to participate. It is
unknown whether more than one staff member participated per child-care centre. Of the 256
participants, 178 (69&#xB7;5 %) completed at least part of the questionnaire and were retained
for further analyses.

        Statistical analyses
        Statistical analyses were performed using the statistical software package IBM SPSS
Statistics 21. Descriptive statistics were used to describe the background characteristics
of the sample. Both internal reliability coefficients (Cronbach&#x2019;s &#x3B1;) and
corrected item&#x2013;total correlations (CITC) were calculated. A cut-off point of 0&#xB7;50 for
Cronbach&#x2019;s &#x3B1; was used(

43

). CITC values above 0&#xB7;30 were regarded as &#x2018;good&#x2019; and values below 0&#xB7;15 as
&#x2018;unreliable&#x2019;(

44

).
        To check whether the data were adequate for factor analysis, the Kaiser&#x2013;Meyer&#x2013;Olkin
measure of sampling adequacy and Bartlett&#x2019;s test of sphericity were measured. A
Kaiser&#x2013;Meyer&#x2013;Olkin value of 0&#xB7;5 was considered suitable. Furthermore, the Bartlett&#x2019;s test
of sphericity needed to be significant(

44

). A principal components analysis with Varimax rotation was performed on items
of the CFAPQ (the forty items of the food-related practices and twenty-three of the
activity-related practices part separately) to determine whether the original factor
structure would be replicated in this sample. All factors had to have an eigenvalue above
1&#xB7;0. The scree plot was used to determine the number of factors(

45

,

46

). The cut-off point for factor loadings was 0&#xB7;30(

45

). In case the factor structure did not equal the factor structures of the
original questionnaires, we forced to retrieve fewer factors to potentially improve the
interpretability of the results.
        In addition, the correlations between the scales based on the factor solutions were
examined using Pearson correlations. Correlations between the scales and child-care
staff&#x2019;s background characteristics were examined using independent-samples
t tests for bivariate variables (i.e. gender, whether they had own
children and educational level), ANOVA for categorical variables (i.e. age, years of
experience in current centre and in general) and Spearman correlations for continuous
variables (i.e. BMI and number of groups in current centre).

      Results

        Background characteristics of the participants of the pilot test
        A total of 178 child-care staff members filled out the questionnaire. Table 1 shows their background characteristics. The
vast majority of the participants were female (98&#xB7;9 %). The largest age group was 26&#x2013;35
years (42&#xB7;7 %). Most had a normal weight (70&#xB7;4 %) and did have children themselves (65&#xB7;2
%). Most participants worked in a mixed age group (53&#xB7;7 %) and had been working at their
current child-care centre for less than 5 years (44&#xB7;4 %).Table 1Background characteristics of

        Factor analyses and psychometric evaluation of the CFAPQ
        The online supplementary material, Supplemental Tables 3 and 4 show the frequencies and
means of the answers to the singe items. The data were considered appropriate for factor
analysis, since the Kaiser&#x2013;Meyer&#x2013;Olkin measure of sampling adequacy was 0&#xB7;66 for the
food-related practices items and 0&#xB7;78 for the activity-related practices items. The
Bartlett&#x2019;s test of sphericity was significant for both parts of the questionnaire at a
level of &lt;0&#xB7;001.

          Food-related practices
          The factor analysis was based on forty items. As we repeatedly found that one item
belonging to the scale of Encouraging balance and variety (&#x2018;Do you encourage the
children to eat healthy foods before unhealthy ones?&#x2019;) did not load on the intended
factor, we decided to delete this item from the factor analysis. However, we decided to
retain this item for further analyses as a single item. Factor analysis on the remaining
thirty-nine items resulted in a twelve-factor solution. The six items of the scale of
Restriction had multiple cross-loadings on several factors, even after forcing the
factor solution to retrieve fewer factors. We therefore deleted the full scale of
restriction and performed a separate factor analysis on the six items conceptually
belonging to Restriction. Even though a two-factor solution was found, we forced to a
one-factor solution and the findings were acceptable (see Table 2). The factor loadings ranged from 0&#xB7;43 to 0&#xB7;71, and internal
consistency was adequate (Cronbach&#x2019;s &#x3B1;=0&#xB7;60 and the CITC ranged from
0&#xB7;23 to 0&#xB7;44 for the six items).Table

          Factor analysis on the remaining thirty-three items retrieved a nine-factor solution
with eigenvalues higher than 1, accounting for 64&#xB7;68 % of the total variance. All except
one (the scale of Food as a reward) of the original scales of the CFPQ(

35

) did load on the intended factors. When looking at the rotated factor
solution, the three items conceptually belonging to the scale of Food as a reward had
high factor loadings on multiple factors. We therefore forced the factor analyses to
retrieve an eight-factor solution, accounting for 61&#xB7;12 % of the total variance. In line
with the nine-factor solution, cross-loadings (&gt;0&#xB7;30) were found for the items of the
scale Food as a reward on multiple factors. Finally, we forced to a seven-factor
solution. This factor solution accounted for 57&#xB7;35 % of the total variance with
eigenvalues higher than 1. The findings of this factor solution are presented in Table 3. Most of the scale items loaded as
expected, conforming to the study of Musher-Eizenman and Holub(

35

). Three factors retrieved contained two scales: factor 2 was represented by
the scale of Encourage balance and variety and the scale of Modelling; factor 3 was
represented by the scales of Environment and Involvement; and factor 7 was represented
by the scales of Emotion regulation and Food as a reward. The other factors contained a
single scale of the original constructed scale: Monitoring, Teaching about nutrition,
Pressure to eat and Child control. Most items loaded onto a single factor. A few had
loadings higher than the absolute value of 0&#xB7;30 on two and sometimes three factors.
These items were allocated to the factor where the theoretical fit was best, conforming
to the original factor structure. For two items, one of the scale of Encourage balance
and variety and one of the scale of Child control, the factor loading was below 0&#xB7;30.
These items were retained in the final factor solution to provide better comparability
with the original factor structure of the CFPQ.Table 3Factor structure of the food-related practices

factor analyses, but retained as a single item: &#x2018;Do you encourage the children
to eat healthy foods before unhealthy ones?&#x2019; (mean=4&#xB7;28, sd=1&#xB7;19).
R=reverse coded. Bold values represent the final factor
structure.&#x2020;Although the factor
loading was below 0&#xB7;30, it is depicted in the table and on theoretical grounds
the item has provisionally been retained on this
factor.

          The internal consistency coefficients for the scales are displayed in Table 3 and can be considered adequate, ranging
from 0&#xB7;53 to 0&#xB7;96. The average CITC are also within acceptable ranges (0&#xB7;30&#x2013;0&#xB7;89). In
addition, Tables 2 and 3 show the means and standard deviations of the food-related CFAPQ
scales.

          Activity-related practices
          The factor analysis was based on twenty-two items, instead of twenty-three items. We
excluded the item &#x2018;How often do you have outdoor toys available for the children (for
example, skipping ropes, balls, etc.)?&#x2019;, as this was the only item representing
availability of physical activity materials and therefore did not represent a certain
type of practice or behaviour a child-care staff member can perform. The factor analysis
revealed a seven-factor solution with eigenvalues higher than 1, accounting for 68&#xB7;25 %
of the total variance. When looking at the rotated factor solution, the three items on
the Promote screen time scale (Discouragement) clustered together with factor loadings
ranging from 0&#xB7;54 to 0&#xB7;86. However, the five items on the Psychological control scale
(Discouragement) had high loadings on two factors. In addition, items on the scale of
Encouragement had high loading on four factors. Three factors represented the following
constructs conceptually belonging to Encouragement of physical activity, namely
Modelling (factor 1), Teaching/autonomy support (factor 2) and Going outdoors (factor
5). The item &#x2018;How often do you dance with the children?&#x2019; was the only item loading on
the fourth factor of Encouragement, factor 7 (factor loading of 0&#xB7;70), although this
item also loaded on factor 1 (Encouragement, Modelling) with a factor loading of 0&#xB7;28.
As this item conceptually belongs to &#x2018;Modelling&#x2019;, we forced the factor analyses to a
six-factor solution.
          The six-factor solution accounted for 63&#xB7;52 % of the total variance with eigenvalues
higher than 1. In agreement with the seven-factor solution, the five items on the
Psychological control scale (Discouragement) still had high loadings on two factors.
However, the item &#x2018;How often do you dance with the children?&#x2019; now loaded onto the first
(Modelling) and second factor (Teaching/autonomy support) belonging to Encouragement,
with a factor loading of 0&#xB7;32 and 0&#xB7;33, respectively. We did again force the factor
analyses, but now to a five-factor solution.
          The five-factor solution explained 58&#xB7;29 % of the variance in responses of the physical
activity practices part of the CFAPQ, with eigenvalues higher than 1. The findings of
this factor solution are presented in Table 4.
With regard to the Discouragement scale, we perfectly found the two scales of
Psychological control (factor 2) and Promote screen time (factor 3). All items of the
two scales had the highest factor loading on the factor the item belongs to. With regard
to the Encouragement scale, three sub-scales were created, one containing eight items
representing Modelling of physical activity (factor 1), another containing five items
representing Teaching/autonomy support of physical activity (factor 4), and the final
factor containing two items representing Going outdoors (factor 5). Some items of factor
4 had higher factor loadings on factor 1, but were retained to factor 4 as the
theoretical fit was best on this factor (i.e. the items &#x2018;How often do you say positive
things to motivate children to be more active?&#x2019; and &#x2018;How often do you teach the children
new and different ways to be active?&#x2019;).Table 4Factor structure of the activity-related

estimates: A-MOD, n 158; A-PC, n 156; A-PST,

available for the children (e.g. skipping ropes, balls)?&#x2019; was not included in
the factor analysis, but retained as a single item (mean=4&#xB7;66,
sd=0&#xB7;51).

          The psychometric evaluation of the created five scales is presented in Table 4. Cronbach&#x2019;s &#x3B1; coefficients
for the five scales ranged from 0&#xB7;58 to 0&#xB7;85. Table
4 also presents average CITC, which suggest adequate consistency of item
content within the scales (0&#xB7;35&#x2013;0&#xB7;62). In addition, Table 4 shows the means and standard deviations of the activity-related CFAPQ
scales.

        Associations between the CFAPQ scales

Table 5 shows the correlations between the CFAPQ
scales. Generally, &#x2018;desirable&#x2019; practices were positively correlated with other desirable
practices (e.g. food-related Modelling and Encouragement of balance and variety
(F-MOD/ENC) showed a strong positive correlation with food-related Teaching about
nutrition (F-TN), r=0&#xB7;53, P&lt;0&#xB7;001) and &#x2018;undesirable&#x2019;
practices were positively correlated with other undesirable practices (e.g.
activity-related Psychological control (A-PC) was positively correlated with Promoting
screen time (A-PST), r=0&#xB7;24, P&lt;0&#xB7;01). In addition,
there were various significant correlations between food-related and activity-related
practices, most often when they concerned similar practices although regarding a different
behaviour. For instance, food-related Modelling and Encouragement (F-MOD/ENC) was
positively associated with activity-related Modelling (A-MOD); r=0&#xB7;33,
P&lt;0&#xB7;01) and food-related Teaching about nutrition (F-TN) was
positively associated with activity-related Teaching and Autonomy support (A-T/AS;
r=0&#xB7;36, P&lt;0&#xB7;001).Table 5Correlations between the child-care

        Associations between the CFAPQ and background characteristics
        The online supplementary material, Supplemental Table 5 shows the final CFAPQ. With
regard to correlations between the CFAPQ and child-care staff&#x2019;s background
characteristics, younger child-care staff scored higher on the activity-related scale
Going outdoors (A-GO) than older staff (18&#x2013;25 years, 3&#xB7;28; 26&#x2013;35 years, 2&#xB7;94; 36&#x2013;45 years,
2&#xB7;91; 46&#x2013;55 years, 3&#xB7;02; 56&#x2013;65 years, 2&#xB7;25; P=0&#xB7;008). Compared with
child-care staff who did not have children themselves, child-care staff who did have
children scored lower on the food-related scale Emotion regulation/Food as reward
(F-ER/FR; 1&#xB7;39 v. 1&#xB7;23 respectively, P=0&#xB7;016), and the
activity-related scales Psychological control (A-PC; 1&#xB7;85 v. 1&#xB7;67,
P=0&#xB7;015) and Going outdoors (A-GO; 3&#xB7;11 v. 2&#xB7;80,
P=0&#xB7;015). Child-care staff&#x2019;s BMI was positively correlated with the
item &#x2018;How often do you have outdoor toys available for the children?&#x2019;
(r=0&#xB7;198, P=0&#xB7;015). Participants&#x2019; educational level was
not significantly related to any of the CFAPQ scales or single items. The association
between participant&#x2019;s gender and the CFAPQ scales could not be examined due to the limited
number of male child-care staff members in the study.
        Child-care staff working in a toddler group (2&#x2013;4 years) scored higher on the
activity-related Teaching/Autonomy support (A-T/AS) scale, compared with child-care staff
in other age groups (3&#xB7;73 v. 3&#xB7;51, P=0&#xB7;016). With regard
to the scores on the food-related Modelling/Encourage balance and variety (F-MOD/ENC)
scale in relation to participants&#x2019; experience in the current child-care centre, an
inverted U-shaped association was found: participants who had been working at the same
child-care centre for 11&#x2013;15 years scored the highest on this scale. Participants with less
or more experience scored lower (&#x2264;5 years, 3&#xB7;61; 6&#x2013;10 years, 3&#xB7;64; 11&#x2013;15 years, 3&#xB7;76;
&gt;15 years, 3&#xB7;71; P=0&#xB7;006). A similar reversed U-shaped association was
found between the Modelling/Encourage balance and variety (F-MOD/ENC) scale and total
number of years working in child-care, although the scores were especially low in the
participants with less than 5 years of experience in child care (&#x2264;5 years, 3&#xB7;46; 6&#x2013;10
years, 3&#xB7;70; 11&#x2013;15 years, 3&#xB7;74; &gt;15 years, 3&#xB7;66; P=0&#xB7;049). There was a
negative correlation between the total number of groups in the child-care centre and the
activity-related scale Going outdoors (A-GO; r=&#x2212;0&#xB7;17,
P=0&#xB7;036), indicating that staff working in larger child-care centres less
often took the children on field trips.

      Discussion
      The aim of the current study was to develop and take the first steps to validate a
questionnaire for child-care staff to assess food-related and activity-related practices.
Based on two validated parenting practices questionnaires, the CFPQ(

35

) and the PPAPP(

36

), and the previous work of Dev and colleagues(

33

,

34

) to translate the CFPQ to the child-care setting, we developed and validated the
Dutch version of the CFAPQ. The scales of the final CFAPQ showed sufficient internal
consistency and CITC within acceptable ranges.
      The CFAPQ consists of sixty-three items (forty food-related items and twenty-three
activity-related), divided over twelve scales (seven food-related and five activity-related
scales; see online supplementary material, Supplemental Table 3). The CFAPQ scales are to a
large extent similar to those of the original CFPQ(

35

) and PPAPP(

36

) scales. As regards the food-related scales, four CFAPQ scales were in line with
the original CFPQ scales: Monitoring, Teaching about nutrition, Pressure to eat and Child
control. The three other CFAPQ scales each combined two original CFPQ scales: Encourage
balance and variety/Modelling, Environment/Involvement and Emotion regulation/Food as a
reward. Regarding the activity-related items, two scales were the same as the original PPAPP
scales: Psychological control and Promote screen time. The other items regarding
encouragement were distributed over three scales: Modelling of physical activity,
Teaching/Autonomy support of physical activity and Going outdoors.
      The CFAPQ was developed based on existing parenting practices questionnaires for several
reasons. First of all, the role of child-care staff at child care is very similar to
parents&#x2019; behaviour at home; with the increasing use of child care, child-care staff are
becoming increasingly responsible for children&#x2019;s development during their early
years(

47

). As the parenting literature is much more advanced in this area, research in
the child-care setting can, or, in our opinion, should, learn and benefit from this. There
is, however, another advantage of developing instruments for the child-care setting in line
with parenting instruments: it allows for comparison between both settings. In line with an
ecological view on environmental influences on children&#x2019;s energy balance-related behaviours,
attunement between the child-care setting and the home setting might be very
important(

48

). Studies regarding general child development have for instance shown that
parents and child-care staff often have different child-rearing attitudes, values, attitudes
and practices(

49

,

50

), and that such inconsistencies have negative effects on children&#x2019;s
well-being(

50

,

51

). The same might be true for children&#x2019;s food-related and activity-related
behaviours. Qualitative studies have repeatedly shown the impact that parents and child-care
providers have beyond their own setting, influencing each other&#x2019;s practices as well as
children&#x2019;s healthy energy balance-related behaviours in the other setting (e.g. references
52&#x2013;56).
This stresses the importance of parent&#x2013;child-care partnerships. However, quantitative
research regarding the importance of continuity between home and child care is
lacking(

48

). To be able to examine this, instruments are needed that can be used in both
settings(

48

). If different instruments are used to assess practices in the child-care
setting than those used in the home setting, any difference between both settings might be
caused by methodological flaws, instead of reflecting actual discontinuity. The development
of the CFAPQ in line with parenting practices questionnaires allows for comparison of
food-related and activity-related practices between the home and child-care settings. There
were numerous correlations among the child-care practices scales of the CFAPQ, including
cross-behavioural associations between food-related and activity-related practices.
      There were various associations between the CFAPQ scales and background characteristics of
the child-care staff. Compared with child-care staff who did have children themselves,
child-care staff who did not have children more often used undesirable practices: they more
often used food to regulate emotions or as a reward, and they more often used psychological
control to regulate children&#x2019;s physical activity. A previous study by Dev and colleagues
showed that child-care staff without children more often used pressure to eat(

34

). These findings indicate that experience with children, including experience
with staff&#x2019;s own children, might be an important predictor of positive food-related
practices. In line with this, we found that experience within the child-care setting was
associated with the use of food-related modelling and encouragement to eat healthily.
However, Dev et al.(

34

) did not find such an association between years of experience and any of the
food-related practices.
      Participants&#x2019; educational level was not significantly related to any of the CFAPQ scales,
which contrasts with the findings of Dev et al. in centre-based child
care(

34

) and with Brann in family day care(

54

), both reporting more use of pressure to eat by lower educated staff. However,
these previous studies compared college graduates with non-college graduates(

34

,

57

), while the current study compared between three similar child-care staff
educations, all at intermediate vocational education level. The differences between the
levels might have been too small to detect any differences in relation to the scales. In
addition, Dev et al. linked a number of other characteristics of child-care
staff to the practices they use, which were not included in the current study. These
included non-white ethnicity, authoritarian feeding style and whether the child-care staff
member was trying to lose weight him-/herself, which were all linked to controlling
practices(

34

). More research is needed to confirm these predictors, as well as to examine
additional predictors. Research regarding food-related parenting practices has for instance
shown that the child&#x2019;s temperament is associated with the practices used by the parents
(e.g. reference 16). This might also be the case in
the child-care setting. Furthermore, research is needed to examine predictors of
activity-related practices, as, to our knowledge, no previous studies reported about
this.
      The current study had several limitations that need to be acknowledged. First, the sample
size was relatively limited, with a sample size of 178 child-care staff members. Moreover,
1028 child-care centres were invited to participate in the study, indicating a maximum
response rate of 17&#xB7;3 % (presuming each participating child-care worker was from a different
child-care centre). This low response rate might reflect a selection bias, limiting the
generalizability of our findings. Further research in larger samples is thus necessary.
Specifically, caution is warranted when interpreting the subgroup analyses, as these
analyses are potentially underpowered. Second, it is not known in how many child-care
centres these 178 child-care staff members were employed. Child-care centres were approached
randomly and asked to inform their employees about the study. We did not register at which
child-care centre the participants were working. It was therefore not possible to correct
for a potential multilevel structure of the data. If more than one child-care worker
participated per centre, these child-care workers would be more alike than child-care
workers from different centres, thus potentially explaining part of the associations found
in the current study. Third, the associations between the practices and background
characteristics were examined using bivariate analyses, thus not taking any potential
confounding into account. Fourth, distributions of the answers to some of the items were
very skewed and/or had limited variability. This might indicate social desirability bias.
Strong points of the current study included building on validated parenting practices
instruments(

) and previous research in the child-care setting(

,

34

). In addition, the current study combined a qualitative in-depth pre-test with a
quantitative pilot test. However, for further validation of the CFAPQ, studies examining the
concurrent and predictive value of the questionnaire would be advisable. A good next step
would be to examine associations between the CFAPQ scales and other staff characteristics
such as physical activity and nutrition-related training and experience. Furthermore, future
studies should look at possibilities to reduce the number of items, as the questionnaire is
still quite lengthy at this point.

      Conclusion
      In conclusion, based on the results of the current study, the CFAPQ seems to be a valid
questionnaire to assess child-care staff&#x2019;s energy balance-related practices, although more
research is needed to confirm its validity. The CFAPQ can be used in studies to gain more
insight into the use of energy balance-related practices in the child-care setting,
predictors of the use of these practices and, perhaps most important, the effect that the
practices have on children&#x2019;s behaviour. Such studies are urgently needed to gain insight
into the role the child-care setting can play in obesity prevention and to inform future
interventions in the child-care setting.
