    Health-compromising behaviors negatively impact the health of direct support
professionals (DSPs) and of the adults with developmental disabilities (DD) whom they
serve. DSPs are at the front line of service provision for adults with DD, assisting in
activities of daily living and community participation. DSPs can have a large social
role1,2 and may impact the
health behavior of their clients with DD.3 In fact, health-compromising behaviors such as eating unhealthy diets may be
modeled and reinforced by DSPs.3
    Adults with DD view DSPs as important sources of both emotional and practical
support.1,2 These relationships
have been documented to impact the health behavior of adults with DD,3 providing an important opportunity to improve the health of adults with DD and
DSPs. This research aligns with Bandura&#x2019;s4 work investigating health promotion through Social Cognitive Theory. More
specifically, Social Cognitive Theory contends that peers in a social network are
influenced by the behaviors of those around them by way of role modeling, serving to
reinforce both health-promoting and health-compromising behaviors. Importantly, peers
can keep one another accountable to achieve meaningful behavior change.4 Thus, with the appropriate training, DSPs could adopt and support meaningful,
positive behavior changes in diet and cooking skills for both themselves and the people
with DD for whom they provide care.
    The health of adults with DD and DSPs is noted for high rates of inactivity, eating
unhealthy diets,3,5&#x2013;8 and obesity.9 Moreover, health-promoting behaviors such as eating diets rich in fruits and
vegetables are lacking among adults with DD and DSPs.3,7,8 There is a growing body of research
highlighting the need for cooking skills and nutrition knowledge to bolster healthier
eating patterns among people without disabilities.10,11 Evidence supports the use of
Social Cognitive Theory in the design of health promotion interventions for people with DD.12 Recent work by Jo and colleagues12 examined the utility of a physical activity intervention based on Social
Cognitive Theory to improve muscle endurance, self-efficacy, and physical activity
levels. Increased self-efficacy, as well as key improvements in physical activity
outcomes, were noted at post-test, highlighting the potential effectiveness of the
Social Cognitive Theory framework for other health promotion interventions in this population.12 Social Cognitive Theory was used to inform a nutrition, physical activity, and
weight loss intervention (Web-Based Guide to Health) in people without disabilities,
which identified social support as a critical factor in the maintenance of healthy choices.13 However, evidence for nutrition and cooking-based health promotion interventions
for people with DD is lacking in the literature. The purpose of this study was to pilot
Cooking Matters in a dyad format to assess the degree to which the
intervention is feasible and acceptable among adults with DD and DSPs. We also
endeavored to explore the usefulness of health promotion interventions like
Cooking Matters to meaningfully change health behavior in adults
with DD for the better.12
    Cooking Matters for Adults is a cooking-based nutrition education
program developed by Share Our Strength to help families shop for and
cook healthy meals on a budget.14,15
Designed for people with low literacy, Cooking Matters teaches food
preparation safety skills in the kitchen including the use of knifes and stoves, and
nutrition knowledge informing healthy food and beverage choices. The active learning
design of Cooking Matters is well suited for many learners, including
adults with disabilities. Yet, to date, no research has investigated the potential for
Cooking Matters to improve these skills in people with DD.
    This pilot study evaluated the satisfaction and acceptability of offering Cooking
Matters to dyads of adults with DD and their DSPs to expand on previous
work examining this influential relationship.1,2 One goal of this study was to
explore the potential for Cooking Matters to improve healthy food
preparation, increase both a balanced diet and healthy food and beverage choices,
increase cooking confidence, and reduce barriers to cooking among adults with DD. We
assessed nutrition knowledge, cooking skills, and attitudes toward the importance of a
healthy diet at pre-test, post-test, and 6-month follow-up.

      Method

        Participants
        In 2017, adults with DD and DSPs were recruited in dyads from a DD provider
organization in Columbus, Ohio, to participate in the Cooking
Matters pilot. To be included in this study, adults with DD had to
live in a supported living setting or in a group home and receive regular
support from a DSP. In Ohio, DD was defined as severe, chronic disabilities
attributable to mental or physical impairment; developed before age 22; expected
to be life long and is the result of functional limitations in at least 3 areas
of major life activity such as self-care, receptive and expressive language,
learning, mobility, self-direction, ability to live independently, and economic self-sufficiency.16 Adults with DD in our sample varied in their level of independence; most
relied on some degree of support from DSPs to plan and prepare meals. When asked
about disability type, all adults in the DD group reported having DD and one
adult reported having intellectual disability as well. DSP was defined as paid
staff that had primary responsibility for assisting the adult(s) with DD with
activities of daily living. Both adults with DD and DSPs participated in the
intervention and assessment. A total of 8 adults with DD
(Mage&#x2009;=&#x2009;51.88,
SDage&#x2009;=&#x2009;5.94; 3 males; 87.5% Caucasian) and 7
DSPs (Mage&#x2009;=&#x2009;47.14,
SDage&#x2009;=&#x2009;9.94; 1 male; 100% African American)
participated in this study.
        DSPs varied in educational background from a high school degree (n&#x2009;=&#x2009;1) to some
college coursework (n&#x2009;=&#x2009;3) to a 2-year college degree (n&#x2009;=&#x2009;3). Some DSPs
indicated they received federal assistance from Women, Infants, and Children
(WIC) (n&#x2009;=&#x2009;2); some indicated they received federal assistance from Supplemental
Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) (n&#x2009;=&#x2009;2); and some indicated they received
assistance from Medicaid (n&#x2009;=&#x2009;3). DSPs&#x2019; average household size was approximately
3.6 while average household size among adults with DD was approximately 2.5. One
DSP provided care for 2 participants with DD, and the other 6 DSPs provided care
to only one adult with DD. All participants completed the pre-, post-, and
6-month follow-up assessments except 2 DSPs that were lost to follow-up 6&#x2009;months
after the intervention.

        Procedure
        This study was approved by the University&#x2019;s institutional review board, protocol
#2016B0371, and written informed consent was obtained by research staff from all
participants or their legal guardian. Quantitative surveys and qualitative
semi-structured interviews were administered at pre-test, post-test, and 6-month
time points. Participants were asked to limit engagement in cooking/nutrition
interventions to Cooking Matters for the duration of this
study.

          Intervention
          Cooking Matters for Adults, developed by Share Our
Strength, is a 6-week intervention designed to help low-income
adults learn about healthy eating and cooking while also learning how both
can be managed to eat healthy on a limited budget.17 Team-taught by a volunteer chef and a nutrition educator, the
Cooking Matters class content included meal
preparation, grocery shopping, food budgeting, and nutrition. The class was
held once a week in the evening for 2&#x2009;hours. Before and after each class, a
member of the research team with DD expertise met with the volunteer chef
and nutrition educator to provide suggestions on using accessible language
for participants with DD. The ongoing consultation with the research team
helped to ensure the Cooking Matters program was accessible
for adults with DD. The authors also worked with Local
Matters, an affiliate of Share Our Strength,
to adapt the curriculum for adults with DD. First, visual aids were used to
demonstrate key concepts. For example, recipes were adapted to include
pictures of food and measurements (see Appendix 1). We adapted directions
for preparing the recipe using short sentences and simple vocabulary.
Second, nutritional labels were simplified and enlarged to draw attention to
key elements such as calories, sodium, and fiber (see Appendix 2). Finally, recipes were
chosen in collaboration with participants. Importantly, some people with DD
have sensitivity to specific food textures, and so involving participants
with DD in the recipe decision making ensured accessible meal preparation.
Overall, the identified changes to the program were minor and consistent
with the intent for Cooking Matters to be accessible to
adults with low literacy.17 Adults with DD engaged in every aspect of food preparation including
cutting, mixing, and stove top cooking.

        Measures

          Cooking Matters for Adults survey
          Cooking Matters for Adults survey was developed by
Share Our Strength to evaluate the Cooking
Matters program.18,19 This survey measured
healthy food preparation (8 items), balanced diet (10 items), healthy
choices (6 items), cooking confidence (4 items), and cooking barriers (3
items) subscales. Healthy food preparation subscale assessed nutritional
food preparation and healthy eating behavior. Balanced diet subscale
assessed frequency of food and beverage intake, including healthy and
unhealthy options, and healthy choices subscale assessed frequency of
choosing low-fat, low-sodium, and other healthy food options. Finally, the
cooking confidence subscale assessed confidence with cooking skills and
preparing and buying healthy foods; and the cooking barriers subscale
assessed participants&#x2019; frustration with cooking and beliefs around how much
time it takes to cook and difficulty of cooking. All items were rated on a
5-point Likert-type scale; 6 items (3 from balanced diet and 3 from cooking
barriers subscales) were reverse scored so that higher scores were
indicative of improvement across all items.
          We adapted the Cooking Matters for Adults survey to improve
cognitive accessibility for participants with DD. Item stems were shortened
and simplified and pictures were added that were consistent with published guidelines.20 See Appendix
3 for a sample of the adapted Cooking Matters
survey. The Flesch-Kincaid reading level of the adapted survey measured at a
4.4 grade level. Research staff read surveys aloud to participants with DD.
DSPs completed the written survey independently.

          Interviews
          A semi-structured interview was developed for this study to assess knowledge
of and attitudes toward healthy eating, frequency of food and beverage
intake, and knowledge about kitchen skills and safety. At the post-test and
6-month time points, additional questions assessed overall satisfaction,
cooking confidence, and acceptability of the dyad approach. Research staff
administered the semi-structured interviews one-on-one to both adults with
DD and DSPs. Interview responses were recorded verbatim.

      Results
      We assessed satisfaction with the Cooking Matters class and
participant acceptance of the dyad approach. All participants (100%) indicated they
liked the program, especially the cooking portion of the class and the healthy
recipes. Participants enjoyed the opportunity to learn and practice healthy cooking
in dyads of adults with DD and DSPs. See Table 1 for direct quotes by adults with DD
and DSPs supporting satisfaction, confidence, and acceptance of Cooking
Matters for dyads.

team, learning new things together . . . &#x201D;

      We examined percent changes in summed scores for the three survey subscales: healthy
food preparation, balanced diet, and healthy choices across three time points for
adults with DD and DSPs (see Figure
1). Among adults with DD, non-significant trends toward improvement at
post-test were observed for healthy food preparation and balanced diet but not
healthy choices. DSPs showed non-significant trends toward improvement at post-test
across all subscales. Importantly, across both groups, these effects were partially
maintained at the 6-month follow-up. For instance, adults with DD maintained a small
improvement in healthy food preparation over baseline and a continued improvement on
balanced diet. From post-test to 6&#x2009;months, adults with DD showed a slight
improvement healthy choices. DSPs maintained improvements in healthy food
preparation, eating a balanced diet, and making healthy choices at the 6-month
follow-up.

        Figure 1.

          Findings from Cooking Matters for Adults survey at pre-test,
post-test, and 6-month follow-up for adults with developmental disabilities
and direct support professionals. DD indicates adults with developmental
disabilities; DSP, direct support professionals. Scores at post-test are
percent changes compared with pre-test. Scores at 6-month follow-up are
percent changes compared with pre-test.

      Recognizing that the small sample size left this pilot study underpowered to detect
statistical significance, a power analysis was performed for sample size estimation
based on these data comparing pre-post impact of the program on adults with DD and
DSPs. The effect size for the 3 knowledge (Healthy Food Preparation, Balanced Diet,
and Healthy Choices) subscales was .3; the projected sample size needed to detect
significant differences with an alpha&#x2009;=&#x2009;&#x2013;.5 and power&#x2009;=&#x2009;.8 is approximately
N&#x2009;=&#x2009;82.
      Qualitative findings from participant interviews were more striking. From pre-test to
post-test, DSPs and adults with DD were more likely to list specific behaviors that
underlie healthy eating and describe health benefits associated with healthy eating.
For example, participants from both groups named the following behaviors: eat a
balanced diet, avoid &#x201C;junk&#x201D; food, healthy cooking, and eating healthy on a budget.
Adults with DD and DSPs listed benefits of healthy eating including lower
cholesterol, weight loss, heart health, and improved quality of life. At post-test,
participants described cooking skills they learned such as washing hands before
prepping foods, wearing gloves, properly cleaning and cutting foods, following a
recipe, cleanliness, and being vigilant while food is cooking. These improvements in
nutrition knowledge and cooking skills were maintained at 6-month follow-up.
      We also assessed cooking confidence and cooking barriers among adults with DD and
DSPs (not displayed). Among adults with DD, cooking confidence increased 13%, but
these effects dropped off at 6&#x2009;months (&#x2013;14%) compared with pre-test. Among DSPs, a
nominal improvement was noted at post-test in cooking confidence (3% increase); this
trend continued at 6-month follow-up (10% increase from pre-test). For adults with
DD, a 34% reduction in cooking barriers was noted at post-test and these effects
were maintained at 6&#x2009;months (41% decrease from pre-test). For DSPs there was an
initial non-significant trend toward improvement in cooking barriers at post-test
(10% reduction in reported barriers), but these effects dropped off at 6&#x2009;months (28%
increase in barriers). In post-test and 6-month follow-up interviews, both DSPs and
adults with DD described feeling more confident about their cooking skills.

      Discussion
      This pilot study demonstrates the feasibility and acceptability of offering a health
education program, Cooking Matters, to inclusive groups of adults
with DD and their DSPs. This study contributes to the body of evidence on the
importance of the relationship between adults with DD and DSPs. The strong emotional
bonds that often characterize this relationship provide an opportunity for positive
coaching, role modeling, and behavior change accountability.1,2 Health behaviors of DSPs could
serve as key barriers or facilitators of meaningful healthy choices made by adults
with DD.21,22 Our approach
of offering Cooking Matters to dyads of adults with DD and their
DSPs has implications for inclusive health education programming in environments
where DSPs support adults with DD such as residential or vocational settings.
      We assessed nutrition knowledge, cooking skills, as well as confidence and perceived
cooking barriers before and after participating in Cooking Matters
and at a 6-month follow-up. Positive trends were noted among adults with DD and
DSPs, although this study was underpowered to detect statistically significant
changes. Importantly, qualitative data complement quantitative findings of improved
healthy food preparation and eating a balanced diet among adults with DD and DSPs.
For instance, rich qualitative data at post-test and 6-months highlight specific
behaviors that underlie healthy food preparation (e.g., eating healthy food on a
budget) and the importance of eating a balanced diet (e.g., avoiding &#x201C;junk&#x201D; food,
eating foods from every food group). These findings are important given the growing
body of literature highlighting the need for cooking skills and nutrition knowledge
to combat poor diet and improve health.10,11
      There were limitations to this study that should be considered when interpreting our
results. First, the small sample size for this pilot study limits the
generalizability of these findings. Future research is needed to replicate this
dyadic approach with larger, more heterogeneous samples. Second, although the
Cooking Matters intervention was offered by trained
Local Matters staff who considered the cognitive accommodations
to be minor, this study would have been strengthened by measuring the fidelity of
the adapted Cooking Matters intervention. Despite these
limitations, this study makes an important contribution to the literature by
demonstrating that a health education program offered to adults with DD and their
DSPs can have a positive impact on health behavior. We have shown that a health
education program offered to adults with DD and DSPs can be practical, acceptable,
and possibly, better together.
