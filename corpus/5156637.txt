        The effect of salt reduction and vitamin E (&#x3B1;-tocopherol) fortification, at a level in excess of that required for a European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) health claim, on the quality of chicken sausages was investigated. Four formulations of chicken sausages were prepared: C (control, 1.3% NaCl, 0&#xA0;mg/kg added &#x3B1;-tocopherol), L (low salt, 0.47% NaCl, 0&#xA0;mg/kg added &#x3B1;-tocopherol), CE (1.3% NaCl, 200&#xA0;mg/kg added &#x3B1;-tocopherol), LE (0.47% NaCl, 200&#xA0;mg/kg added &#x3B1;-tocopherol). Salt or &#x3B1;-tocopherol level did not significantly affect the fat content, protein content, moisture content, lipid oxidation, microbial growth, cook loss or texture profile analysis values of raw or cooked sausages. There was a significant effect of salt level on the ash content of raw and cooked sausages. Colour of cooked sausages was affected by salt reduction, with fried low salt sausages being darker and yellower than control, while grilled low salt sausages were lighter and redder than control. Cooking and storage did not significantly affect &#x3B1;-tocopherol retention, and enough was retained to meet both the EFSA nutrient and health claims. The sensory properties of the sausages were unaffected by the reduction in salt, and by fortification with &#x3B1;-tocopherol.
