nhance the color stability, minimize
lipid oxidation and improve microbial safety of meat products. The seasoned meat
products are more susceptible to spoilage of microorganism (Rysman et al., 2016). These products are usually marketed at
refrigerated temperature (2&#xB0;C&#x2212;5&#xB0;C) in order to increase shelf
life (Radha Krishnan et al., 2015). The
spoilage due to the lipid oxidation has deleterious consequences on the quality of
fresh meat and other meat products resulting in massive economic losses (Shahidi and Zhong, 2010). While microbial
activities in the food products may also destroy the quality of meat by the
development of undesirable responses involving the worsening of odour, color and
textural properties of food products (Lucera et al.,
2012).
      The spoilage factors in meat products sometimes produce toxic materials which are
hazardous for human health (Jiang and Xiong,
2016). Therefore a vast amount of antioxidants, which have been
chemically synthesized, are added to the meat products, such as butylated
hydroxyanisole (BHA) and butylated hydroxytoluene (BHT). However, use of potentially
carcinogenic substances is not permitted in some countries (Falowo et al., 2014). Therefore, meat industry is largely
applying antioxidants from plant sources as safer alternatives and preservatives
(Devatkal and Naveena, 2010).
      A number of plant materials have been used directly or indirectly, as seasoning
materials for the antimicrobial purpose, to improve the meat quality (Appendini and Hotchkiss, 2002). The natural
preservatives used for the meat producers include cinnamon, clove, rosemary, basil,
thyme, oregano, lemon leaf, ginger, basilica, balm, coriander and many of them are
generally recognized as safe (GRAS) in food industry (Alfonzo et al., 2017; Jiang and Xiong,
2016; Khaleque et al., 2016).
Chinese cinnamon (Cinnamomum cassia) is usually add to the deserts,
drinks or bakery products, majorly in South Asian and Central Asian regions, and
considered as a vital spice in many meat products. Cinnamon is commonly used in meat
and fast food products for culinary purpose, and has been usually described as a
powerful antioxidant and antibacterial agent in the seasoned meat and fish products
(Al Sahlany, 2017; Ozogul et al., 2017). Previous study has been confirmed that
cinnamon has effective free radical scavenging activity due to the presence of
bioactive compounds (Radha Krishnan at al.,
2014). Cinnamaldehyde is the major constituent responsible for it high
antioxidant activity (Dudonne et al., 2009)
and the ability of cinnamon to preserve meat quality has been tested in beef burger,
grass crabs and inactivate Listeria monocytogens in ground beef and
chicken meatballs (Ghabraie et al., 2016;
Huang et al., 2017; Khaleque et al., 2016).
      The effects of adding Chinese cinnamon powder directly into the ground lamb meat to
maintain meat quality has not been tested previously. Therefore the aim of this
study was to examine the effectiveness of different concentrations of Chinese
cinnamon powder on the ground lamb meat quality. For this purpose, concentrations of
0.5%, 1.5%, and 2.5% Chinese cinnamon powder were added to the
ground lamb meat and total viable counts (TVC), pH, lipid oxidation and color
attributes were evaluated. Furthermore, the antioxidant activity of Chinese cinnamon
aqueous extract was also measured. This study may provide potential implications in
substituting synthetic antioxidants with natural ones.

      Materials and Methods

        Materials and preparation of extracts
        Dried bark of Chinese cinnamon was obtained from a local supermarket. Chinese
cinnamon bark was divided into small pieces and grounded to powder by a high
performance kitchen grinder (High Speed Universal Grinder, Tianjin, China). The
powder was sieved with the help of sieve (1.651 mm, ASTM No. 10), and packed
into 100 g packs and then stored in high-density polyethylene bags at
25&#xB0;C until its further usage. Exactly 50 g powder was refluxed by using
450 mL distilled water for 5 h in enclosed flasks with constant shaking at
180&#xD7;g by following the method from Sivarajan et al. (2017) to obtain a 10% w/v water extract.
Then the extract was cooled and filtered twice using Whatman filter paper and
used for performing the DPPH antioxidant assay.

        Antioxidant activity
        The DPPH-radical-scavenging activity of aqueous extracts was assessed by
following the protocol of Elahi and Mu
(2017). Chinese cinnamon and BHT at concentrations of (20, 40, 60
mg/mL) were prepared by addition of 2 mL of freshly prepared DPPH solution (0.1
mM in 95% methanol). The solution was vortexes using a mixer and
incubated in dark at 27&#xB0;C for 40 min. After that, each sample absorbance
was checked at 516 nm using a UV spectrophotometer (Shimadzu UV-1800
Spectrophotometer, Kyoto, Japan) at room temperature. The radical-scavenging
activity of samples were calculated in to percentage by following equation.

        where &#x201C;AE&#x201D; showed the absorbance of solution at 516 nm after mixing
the 1 mL of all samples with 2 mL of 0.1 mM DPPH solutions and 30 min incubation
at room temperature, while &#x201C;AD&#x201D; showed the absorbance of 2 mL 0.1
mM DPPH solutions mixed with 1 mL Milli-Q water.

        Sample preparation, packaging and storage
        Fresh lamb meat (Oyster muscles) was purchased from a local
market at 24 h post-mortem and was placed in insulated polystyrene ice boxes and
transferred to the laboratory within 1 h. The muscles were trimmed to remove
connective tissues under hygienic conditions and minced using a mincer machine
(8 mm plates). The minced lamb meat samples were assigned to the following four
treatments: control (without any additive), 0.5%, 1.5%, and
2.5% of Chinese cinnamon powder applied on the 100 g ground lamb meat.
Immediately after adding the Chinese cinnamon powder, samples were thoroughly
hand-mixed using a bowl mixer and 100 g ground lamb meat (round shape and 1.5 cm
thick) was prepared for each treatment with three replicates. The lamb meat
samples were vacuum packaged (VP), properly labelled and stored at 4&#xB0;C
for 16 days. The vacuum packaged samples were sealed in polyethylene bags (20/70
mm) (Vacioplast, Salamanca, Spain) with an oxygen permeability lower than 40
cm3/(m2 day atm). After that, the samples were
collected at 0 (approximately 24 h post mortem), 4, 8, 12 and 16 days of
storage. At the time of sampling, 10 g sample was collected immediately under
aseptic conditions for microbiological analysis. While the meat color was
determined after blooming for 30 min at 4&#xB0;C and then the remaining
samples were frozen at &#x2212;80&#xB0;C priors to thiobarbituric acid
reactive substances (TBARS) analysis. The above experiment was carried out in
triplicates.

        Analysis of meat samples

          pH
          The pH value of ground lamb was determined by pH meter (Testo 205 pH meter,
Lenzkirch, Germany). Before measurement, pH meter was calibrated by buffers
of different pH concentrations i.e. 4.00 and 7.00 at 25&#xB0;C. The glass
rod of pH meter was inserted directly into the ground meat sample. Each
time, four readings were recorded from different locations and averaged.

          Color
          The meat surface color was recorded using Minolta spectrophotometer (CM-600d,
Konica Minolta Sensing Inc., Osaka, Japan) with 8 mm diameter measuring
aperture size Illuminant D65, 10&#xB0; standard observer and CIE L*, a*,
b* color score. Four measurements were recorded throughout the surface of
selected samples (Li et al., 2017).
The color of meat samples at 0 days was taken after collecting the fresh-cut
surface from the local market. At each time point the vacuumed packed
samples were opened and the surface color of ground lamb meat was measured
at 0, 4, 8, 12, and 16 days after 30 min of blooming at 4&#xB0;C.

          Lipid oxidation
          Lipid oxidation analysis was conducted with minor modification by following
the method described by Belles et al.
(2017). Briefly, 20 mL of 10% tricloracetic acid (VWR) was
mixed with 10 g of meat and homogenized at 724&#xD7;g by using ultraturrax
for 90 s (T-10 basic, IKA-Werke, Staufen, Germany). Then the samples were
centrifuged for 30 min at 10&#xB0;C at 2,897&#xD7;g (High-Speed
Refrigerated Centrifuge, CR 21N, Hitachi, Tokyo, Japan). The supernatant was
filtered by using filter paper and 2 mL of the filtrate was added with the
equal quantity of TBA 20 mM (Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO, USA). After that,
the mixture was vortexed and incubated in a water-bath at 97&#xB0;C for 20
min. At the end, samples were cooled under tap water at ambient temperature
of 15&#xB0;C and absorbance was measured at 532 nm by using
spectrophotometer (Shimadzu UV-1800 Spectrophotometer, Kyoto, Japan). The
TBARS, mainly malondialdehyde (MDA), was calculated from a standard curve of
1,1,3,3-tetraethoxypropane (TEP; Sigma-Aldrich), the lipid oxidation was
expressed as the average of three replicates per sample in mg
malondialdehyde/kg meat.

          Microbiological analysis
          TVC were inspected based on standard plate count method by the method of
Zhang et al. (2016). In brief, 10
g sample was taken aseptically from vacuumed bags and homogenized in 90 mL
of sterile physiological saline in stomacher bags for 1 minute. For
microbial enumeration, suitable serial dilutions were prepared using the
same diluent, by following the protocol of International Organization for
Standardization&#x2019;s (ISO, 2003).
Then the deriving suspension was serially diluted (1:10) in sterile
physiological saline water and 1 mL samples of appropriate dilutions were
poured into the petridishes, containing 15&#x2013;20 mL of plates count agar
(PCA). The number of bacterial colonies on the plates were enumerated after
incubation for 48 h at 37&#xB0;C and expressed as Log CFU (colony forming
units)/g meat.

        Statistical analysis
        The experiment was designed with Chinese cinnamon treatments and storage times as
fixed factors and replicates as random factor. General linear model (GLM) was
used to express the significance of differences (p&lt;0.05) between means.
Statistical analysis of data was performed using the IBM statistical package for
social sciences (SPSS) Statistics 22 software (SPSS Inc., Chicago, IL, USA).
Duncan multiple range test was applied to determine the significant difference
(p&lt;0.05). The data were expressed as the mean&#xB1;SD. Experiments were
replicated three times and all parametric measurements were carried out in
duplicate.

      Results and Discussion

        Antioxidant activity
        The DPPH radical scavenging activity of Chinese cinnamon aqueous extract at the
concentrations of 20, 40, and 60 mg/mL were considerably lower than the pure
antioxidant BHT as shown in Fig. 1
(p&lt;0.05). The Chinese cinnamon aqueous extract showed strong antioxidant
activity in all concentrations but the highest antioxidant activity was seen in
60 mg/mL indicating the highest radical scavenging activity (p&lt;0.05).

        Previously reported studies have confirmed that cinnamon is distinguished by its
effective radical scavenging activity due to bioactive substances (Radha Krishnan et al., 2014). The higher
antioxidant activity in cinnamon might be due to the presence of significant
amount of phenolic antioxidants and flavonoids compound (Jayaprakasha et al., 2007). Kuspradini et al. (2016) reported that cinnamon aqueous extract as
well as cinnamon oil, have shown considerable antioxidant activity. Radha Krishnan et al. (2015) claimed that
cinnamaldehyde was the responsible compound in the cinnamon for its high
antioxidant activity.

        pH
        The results of adding Chinese cinnamon powder on the pH of ground lamb meat
stored at 4&#xB0;C were presented in Table
1. The pH of control had a significant increased from day 12 to 16
while that of all other treatments samples remained the same during storage. The
pH for all samples was same at day 0, while at day 4 the pH value of samples
with 1.5% Chinese cinnamon powder was significantly lower (p&lt;0.05)
that of the control group and the other treatment groups. The pH values of
samples from the control group and the 0.5% treated group had no
significant difference with each other on day 8, whereas the stored samples with
concentrations of 1.5% and 2.5% Chinese cinnamon powder showed a
significant difference (p&lt;0.05) compared with control group. With the
increase of storage time, the samples with 2.5% concentration showed
lower pH values at day 12 and 16 than control and other treated samples
(p&lt;0.05). Overall, the control group had a higher pH (p&lt;0.05) at
day 12 and 16 than that of other treatments during the storage.

        The increment in the pH of sample stored under control group during the storage
might be due to the generation of some basic compounds and ammonia caused by
proteolysis resulting from the growth of microorganism (Chaijan et al., 2005; Masniyom et al., 2002). Radha
Krishnan et al. (2014) and Brilliana
et al. (2017) reported that during refrigerated storage, lower pH was
noted in the raw beef meat samples treated with cinnamon oil compared to
non-additive control. In the present study, the lower pH in the treatment
samples might be due to the strong activity of bioactive compounds from the
Chinese cinnamon powder.

        Color
        The L*, a*, and b* of Chinese cinnamon powder treated and untreated ground lamb
meat samples stored at 4&#xB0;C were presented in Table 2. L* (lightness) value of samples from control group
was significantly (p&lt;0.05) higher throughout the whole storage time
compared with other treatments. Among all Chinese cinnamon treated samples, the
lower L* values were noted in samples with 2.5% concentration treatment
in all storage days except for day 8 (p&lt;0.05). The addition of Chinese
cinnamon powder directly into the ground lamb might decrease the lightness of
treated samples. The a* (redness) value of ground lamb was also affected by the
addition of Chinese cinnamon powder during storage as shown in Table 2. The a* value of the control group
showed a decreasing trend throughout the storage as compared to all the
experiment groups. The initial a* values for all stored samples at 4&#xB0;C
were significantly different from each other (p&lt;0.05). The a* values of
control group and 0.5% treatment group were significantly higher at day 4
than those of samples with 1.5% and 2.5% treatments. At day 8 the
a* value of control samples was considerably higher (p&lt;0.05) than treated
samples with 0.5% and 2.5% of concentration, while no significant
difference was noted in samples from 1.5% treatment. As the days
proceeded, at day 12 there were no significant differences between control group
and all other Chinese cinnamon treated samples. The a* value for samples stored
under control was lower than that of 1.5% treated samples at day 16,
while no significant difference was found between samples with 0.5% and
2.5% of Chinese cinnamon powder (p&lt;0.05).

              Mean values in different letters within the same row are differ

        The b* (yellowness) value for control group was higher at the initial day than
that of the 1.5% and 2.5% treated groups (p&lt;0.05), while no
significant difference was noted in stored samples for 1.5% treatment.
Whereas, on day 4 and 8 the only significant difference was noticed between
control and 2.5% treatment groups than the samples with 0.5% and
1.5% treatment. The b* values for all stored samples included control and
other Chinese cinnamon treated samples had no significant difference
(p&lt;0.05) after day 12 to 16 during storage.
        It was proved that the meat discoloration was directly related with the storage
length, and a* had a negative correlation with storage time (Terns et al., 2011), which might be
possibly associated with an increase in TBARS (Grimsrud et al., 2008). Previous results confirmed that the addition
of natural antioxidants might slow down the formation of metmyoglobin,
ultimately delaying the deterioration of red color (Belles et al., 2017; Xia et
al., 2009). Keokamnerd et al.
(2008) observed that a* value was reduced in the minced chicken after
12 days of storage. The lessening in the intensity of redness values during
storage was probably due to the relationship between lipid oxidation and color
oxidation in the meat (Lynch and Faustman,
2000). In the current study, the fluctuations in the a* values were
observed in all samples during the storage. The results were in accordance with
the previous findings (Ozunlu et al.,
2018; Zhang et al., 2016). The
variation in the a* values might be due the MetMb% formation which can
lead to the discoloration of the fresh meat (Krala, 2001).

        Lipid oxidation
        The oxidative stability of control group and experiment groups was evaluated
throughout the storage by determining the TBARS as shown in Fig. 2. The TBARS value was continuously increasing in the
control group during the storage duration (p&lt;0.05). Whereas, the TBARS
values of Chinese cinnamon treated samples retarded during the storage
intervals. Compared with experiment groups, the TBARS of control group was
notably (p&lt;0.05) higher during day 4 to 16. However, among all
treatments, the samples with 2.5% treatment exhibited the lower TBARS
values after day 8 to 16 (p&lt;0.05). The TBARS value for the control was
significantly (p&lt;0.05) higher at day 16 than that of Chinese cinnamon
treated samples. The results suggested that Chinese cinnamon powder was
effective against the TBARS formation in the ground lamb during storage at
4&#xB0;C.

        The cinnamon contained active compounds, which can lead to antioxidant and
antibacterial actions in meat (Madsen and
Bertelsen, 1995). Previous studies reported that the rapid increase
in oxidation of control samples in the rainbow trout was due to non-availability
of anti-oxidants (Shadman et al., 2017).
The findings of present study agreed with the results of Shaltout et al. (2017), who also observed that the addition
of cinnamon oil in beef delayed lipid oxidation during storage. Therefore, the
reduction of TBARS in Chinese cinnamon treated samples may be caused by the
presence of antioxidant compounds like cinnamaldehyde, eugenol and cinnamic acid
(Dudonne et al., 2009). These
antioxidants compounds may be useful against free radical damage (Dragland et al., 2003).

        Microbiological analysis
        The effect of Chinese cinnamon powder on the TVC of ground lamb meat stored at
4&#xB0;C for 16 days was presented in Fig.
3. The TVC of the control group increased immediately and rapidly
than other samples treated by Chinese cinnamon powder. At initial day, there was
no significant difference between the samples of the control and other treated
samples. The TVC in control significantly increased (p&lt;0.05) with the
increment of time points at day 4 and crossed the limit of 7 log CFU/g at 16
days, while the treated samples retarded the growth of TVC. During the whole
period of storage, the samples with 1.5% treatment showed significantly
(p&lt;0.05) lower TVC values at days 8 and 16, and the lowest enumeration
was counted at day 8. From the obtained results, it was proved that TVC in the
ground lamb meat may be inhibited by the addition of Chinese cinnamon powder
(p&lt;0.05).

        It has been reported that cinnamon inhibited microbes by several ways, such as
rupturing of cell wall by the action antioxidant compounds, disordering the
cytoplasmic membrane, cellular components disturbance by leakage, changed fatty
acid and phospholipid constituents, affecting the DNA and RNA formation and
destroying protein translocation (Bajpai et al.,
2013). Comparable results were obtained by Gutierrez et al. (2008), where it was reported that the
addition of cinnamon oil was more effective in decreasing the microbial counts
in the food ingredients. In another study, cinnamon bark has been proved as a
potential source against all pathogenic and spoilage bacteria (Ghabraie et al., 2016). Shaltout et al. (2017) observed that the
incorporation of cinnamon oil was more efficient in maintaining meat quality.
The reduction in the TVC during storage might be due to the presence of
bioactive compounds present in the Chinese cinnamon powder.

      Conclusions
      In conclusion, Chinese cinnamon powder could maintain the quality of ground lamb meat
by reducing the TVC and TBARS. The L* and a* values in the ground lamb meat can be
affected during the storage by adding the Chinese cinnamon powder with a
concentration higher than 0.5%. The results of the present study suggested
that Chinese cinnamon powder at a level of 0.5% had the potential to maintain
the ground lamb meat quality during storage. So it could be proposed as a natural
alternative of synthetic additives to maintain the meat quality.
