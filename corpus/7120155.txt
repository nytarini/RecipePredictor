       Asthma is a chronic inflammatory lung disease, triggered by either an IgE allergic reaction or nonallergic factors, and results in reversible airway obstruction and inflammation of the airway [11]. It is characterized by recurrent episodes of wheezing, breathlessness, coughing, and chest tightness [11]. Severe asthma or asthma that is chronic or poorly controlled may lead to airway and lung remodeling that involves deposition of fibrotic tissue which leads to constriction of the bronchi [18].
          Although the exact mechanisms have not yet been identified, compromised nutritional status, such as deficiencies in selenium, zinc, and vitamins A, C, D, and E, has been connected to asthma [155]. The pathophysiology of asthma, nutrition considerations, genotypic characteristics, and lifestyle influences will be discussed in this section.
          There are numerous potential triggers to the development and/or exacerbation of asthma which can be summarized in &#x25BA; Box 51.2.
          The various causes of asthma have led to the classification of several different subtypes and endotypes of asthma in hopes of choosing more targeted treatments.

          Pathophysiology
          The pathophysiology of asthma is complex and not fully understood, due in part to its heterogeneous nature, which necessitates its organization into individual phenotypes and endotypes. This organization is important to be able to utilize targeted treatments by identifying the root causes of the symptoms. However, more research is needed to more clearly identify the specific pathological mechanisms of each phenotype and particular treatment responses [156].
          Two of the most common asthma phenotypes are allergic and nonallergic asthma [147]; allergic is characterized by increased Th2 immunity (Th2 high) and nonallergic defined by varying mechanisms depending on the trigger (Th2 low) [157] (see also &#x25BA; Chap. 10.1007/978-3-030-30730-1_19).
           Allergic asthma involves the ingestion of typically harmless environmental triggers (listed in &#x25D8; Table 51.3) by antigen-presenting cells in the bronchi, which interact with immature helper T cells that, in turn, trigger an unwarranted allergic response [18]. This reaction occurs from repeated exposure to a trigger and is referred to as the type 1 hypersensitivity response [18]. This increased Th2 immunity upregulates eosinophilic inflammation, tissue damage, airway hyperresponsiveness, and bronchoconstriction [113]. Mast cell activation disorders, which is characterized by diseases and conditions related to mast cell mediators and the activation of mast cells, must also be considered when addressing allergic asthma [158].
          In contrast, nonallergic asthma can be caused by other factors such as anxiety, exercise, stress, dry air, cold air, viruses, hyperventilation, smoke, or other irritants [11]. Individuals suffering from nonallergic asthma will tend to be less responsive to Th2-targeted treatments due to a differing immune response at play [157].
          Some of the additional proposed phenotypes are eosinophilic, exacerbation-prone, exercise-induced, fixed obstruction/airflow limitation, poorly steroid-responsive, and adult-onset obesity-related [159]. Several of the proposed endotypes are summarized in &#x25D8; Table 51.4.Table 51.4A few of the proposed phenotypes and endotypes and their characteristicsProposed phenotype or endotypeClinical findingsBiomarkersEpidemiologyProposed mechanisms/geneticsMedicationsPhenotypes Allergic asthma Allergic rhinitisAllergen-associated symptomsPositive skin prick tests (SPT)High IgEHigh FeNOChildhood onsetHistory of eczemaTh2 dominantTh2 pathway single-nucleotide polymorphismsLess responsive to inhaled corticosteroidsIgE antagonists (omalizumab) are typically more effective [159]Nonallergic asthma [156]Asthma not associated with allergicMay be neutrophilic, eosinophilic, or contain only a few inflammatory cellsAdditional research neededAdditional research neededLess responsive to inhaled corticosteroids Severe late-onset hypereosinophilic asthma (see box below on eosinophilic asthma)Severe exacerbations, late-onset diseaseBlood and sputum eosinophils20% of severe asthmaticsNonatopicGenetics unknownOral corticosteroids, IL-5 antibody therapy potential treatmentEndotypes Allergic bronchopulmonary mycosis (ABPM)SevereMucus productionBlood eosinophilsHigh IgEHigh FeNOAdult onsetLong durationPoor prognosisColonization of airwaysHuman leukocyte(HLA) and rare cystic fibrosis (CF) variantsOral corticosteroids(not inhaled) and oral antifungal agents can be effective [159]Cross-country skiing-induced asthma (CCSA) [107]Exposure to dry, cold air provoking wheezingAirway remodeling, thickening of basement membraneIncreased lymphocytes, macrophages, neutrophilsSeldom eosinophilsInduced at very cold temperatures during strenuous exerciseNonatopicUnknownUsually not responsive to glucocorticoids [159]Based on data from Ref. [157]
          The American Partnership for Eosinophilic Disorders defines eosinophilic asthma as a type of asthma characterized by especially high levels of eosinophils, more commonly developed later in adulthood, although may occur in some children [160]. Many with eosinophilic asthma do not have underlying allergies or history of allergic conditions such as eczema, food allergy, and hay fever, which are thought to be seen more in people with allergic asthma [160]. In contrast to allergic asthma, the cause of eosinophilic asthma is still unknown.
           Histamine intolerance must also be considered in assessing the root cause of asthma. Ingesting histamine-rich foods and beverages such as bananas, grapes, strawberries, citrus fruits, tomatoes, nuts, chocolate, pineapples, fish, spinach, fermented foods, and beverages [161] has been shown to provoke a histamine response that may result in asthma exacerbations, among many other potential signs and symptoms [162].
          Disruptions in redox, or oxidation/reduction, reactions in addition to hindered antioxidant defense have been found to be a risk factor for asthma severity and development [163]. The levels of glutathione, one of the lung&#x2019;s most predominant antioxidants in both reduced and unreduced forms, are thought to be important for lung homeostasis and tied to asthma [163]. More research is needed to determine the exact differences in the pathophysiologies of the various subtypes of asthma in order to develop more targeted treatments.

          Key Nutrient Cofactors for Respiration and How to Modulate Toward Optimum
           Minerals such as zinc, selenium, copper, and manganese may serve as cofactors to major enzymes with antioxidant activity in the lung, such as superoxide dismutase, catalase, and glutathione peroxidase [164]. Asthma has been associated with decreased activity of these enzymes [165].
          Low selenium intake has been associated with multiple chronic diseases including asthma [163]. Selenium serves as a cofactor to glutathione peroxidase, an enzyme with antioxidant activity in the lung that is responsible for maintaining GSH/GSSG redox balance [163].
          Imbalance between oxidants and antioxidants seems to serve an important role in asthma. Levels of nonenzymatic antioxidants glutathione, ascorbic acid, alpha-tocopherol, lycopene, and beta-carotene, in addition to antioxidant enzymes superoxide dismutase (SOD) and glutathione peroxidase, were significantly lower in asthmatic children compared to healthy controls [165]. The amino acids glycine and glutamine, which are important in glutathione synthesis, were also found to be significantly lower in children with asthma [165].
          DHA has also been found to be abundant in airway mucosa, where it is decreased in individuals with asthma and cystic fibrosis [166].
          Magnesium is known to elicit the relaxation of bronchial smooth muscle, decrease responsiveness to histamine, have an anti-inflammatory effect, and decrease the susceptibility of animals to developing anaphylactic reactions [25]. It is estimated that two-thirds of the population in the Western world is not consuming the recommended daily allowance of magnesium [167]. Magnesium can be used intravenously as an effective treatment of acute asthma attacks. One double-blind controlled trial that used 1.2 g of magnesium sulfate when patients did not respond to treatment with beta-agonists found decreased likelihood of hospitalization and improved lung function [168]. Magnesium sulfate as an adjunct therapy with bronchodilators and steroids has also been shown to have a benefit in children with moderate to severe asthma [168]. Although the exact mechanism is not yet known, magnesium is thought to increase glutathione concentrations in the lung [169].
          More research is needed to determine additional associations between specific nutrients and asthma. However, optimization of the nutrients discussed in this section has the potential to reduce the severity and/or progression of asthma (&#x25D8; Fig. 51.5).Fig. 51.5Potential mechanisms of methyl donors and vitamins.

          Key Genotypic Characteristics of Topic and Nutritional Influence
          Asthma has a strong genetic component, with more than 100 genes associated with it in varying degrees across many populations [18]. More recent potential genetic associations include Filaggrin, which encodes for the epithelial barrier; ORMDL3, which encodes transmembrane protein; beta-2 adrenergic receptor gene, expressed throughout smooth muscle and epithelial cells of the lung; and interleukin-4 receptor gene, which has a variant associated with elevated IgE [171].

          Key Dietary and Food Patterns to Promote Disease or Wellness in Asthma Nutrition Status
          A 2011 systematic review and meta-analysis showed that deficiencies in selenium, zinc, vitamins A, C, D, and E, and low fruit and vegetable intake could be associated with the development of asthma [155]. Although this data is tenuous due to lack of randomized controlled trials, it does give some indication of the relationship between nutrition status and dietary patterns with respect to asthma development. More research needs to be done to isolate the impact of these nutrients and dietary patterns on asthma prevention and development.

             Dietary Patterns 
            A 2015 review conducted by Berthon and Wood noted the protective effects of the Mediterranean diet for allergic respiratory diseases as evidenced by epidemiological studies. This diet emphasizes minimally processed plant foods in the form of fruit, vegetables, cereals, beans, breads, nuts, seeds, and olive oil and low to moderate intake of dairy, poultry, fish, and wine, as well as low intake of red meat [172]. This association was the strongest in children, where the Mediterranean diet had a protective effect on atopy, wheezing, and asthma symptoms [172]. However, there is less data available to support this pattern in adults.
            The same review noted an association between the &#x201C;Western&#x201D; diet, which emphasizes refined grains, red and cured meats, French fries, sweets and desserts, and high-fat dairy products and increased risk of asthma in children [172]. A meta-analysis and systematic review done in 2014 showed a reduction of risk in childhood wheezing with high fruit and vegetable intake and also showed negative association between fruit and vegetable intake and asthma risk in adults and children [173].

            Food Allergy
            In contrast, food allergy has been especially linked with allergic asthma in children [161]. A study examining food allergy in asthmatic children identified higher serum levels of IgE in asthmatic children compared to healthy controls, where all asthmatic children in the study were also identified as having a positive skin prick test (SPT) to various food allergens [174].
            A study done on 322 children under the age of 1 diagnosed with asthma, with or without allergic rhinitis, was placed on a meat-based formula of carrots, beef, broccoli, and apricots for 6 weeks. It was found that 61% had nearly complete resolution of symptoms [25]. This same study also found that the most common food triggers were milk, egg, chocolate, soy, legumes, and grains [25].
            While food allergy as a cause of asthma is more common in children, hidden food allergy has been reported to be the root cause of asthma in around 40% of adults [25]. Improvement in respiratory symptoms was also seen in a small study of adults given an antigen-free elemental diet in a hospital setting [25].
            Removal of food triggers has also been linked to improvement in exercise-induced asthma [25].
            Identifying food allergies can be a complicated process because many of the testing methodologies such as skin prick tests (SPTs) and blood tests can yield false-positive results for up to 50&#x2013;60% of cases, according to the Food Allergy Research &amp; Education Organization [175]. A food elimination diet and/or oral food challenge can be a powerful tool in determining food allergy specific to asthma symptoms, where a dietitian or nutritionist in conjunction with physician and/or allergist can serve an important role through this process to support the individual.

          Mechanisms and Relevance to Asthma as a Chronic Disease
           Oxidative stress may play a key role in the development of asthma, which can also be true for the development of chronic diseases such as cardiovascular disease, diabetes, and cancer [117].
          It has been shown that obesity may be a risk factor for people with and without allergy and may worsen pre-existing asthma [159]. Individuals with asthma are twice as likely to have gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) than people who do not have asthma, especially those resistant to treatment [159].
          Celiac disease and asthma have also been linked. An Italian cohort study was done that showed a significant association between treated asthma and celiac disease, where antibiotic exposure in the first year of life was controlled for and not found to contribute to this association [176]. It has also been found that individuals with celiac disease following a gluten-free diet experienced improvement in asthma symptoms [25].

            Key Toxin-Related Influences
            It is well-known that toxic exposure to particulate matter, airborne pollutants, or cigarette smoke can trigger asthma symptoms [165]. More specifically, a dose-dependent relationship between cigarette smoke exposure and rates of asthma has been shown [165]. Traffic density and asthma exacerbations have also been clearly demonstrated [165].
            Certain medications may also serve as triggers to asthma. Aspirin-exacerbated respiratory disease (AERD) is considered another asthma subtype caused by nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDS) and is characterized by asthma, chronic rhinosinusitis, and acute respiratory reactions [159]. In addition, overuse of antibiotics in childhood has been linked to asthma [18], indicating a connection between the microbiome and asthma development.
             Allergic bronchopulmonary mycosis (ABPM) noted in &#x25D8; Table 51.4 is caused by a hypersensitivity reaction to fungal colonization of the airways [159]. This is typically caused by the fungus Aspergillus fumigatus. Without treatment, this may lead to fixed airflow obstruction and bronchiectasis [159].

          Key Lifestyle Influences 
          The progression of asthma is complex and multifaceted, from preconception through childhood and adulthood. Research suggests that early life events are largely predictive for regulatory mechanisms within the pulmonary immune system [177]. For example, prenatal exposure to a farming environment, one rich in microbial compounds, is thought to influence innate immune patterning in the mother which may affect the development of the neonatal immune system [177]. This influence in immune patterning can be seen through higher expression of Toll-like receptors 2 and 4 and CD14 on peripheral blood cells, which implies possible desensitization to allergens in children [178]. T regulatory cells, which serve an important role in immune regulation and are thought to play an important role in asthma by suppressing the Th2 inflammatory response to harmless air particles, have been shown to be impaired in the cord blood of neonates at hereditary risk for allergy [179].
          In the 2017 study performed by Singh et al. looking at serum IgE and cutaneous sensitivity to food allergens in asthmatic children here was a negative correlation of total IgE and duration of breastfeeding, indicating a connection between breastfeeding and the immune response [174].
          Additionally, reduced maternal intake of vitamins D and E and zinc during pregnancy has been associated with increased asthma symptoms in children [180, 181]. Vitamin D has been associated with the maintenance and/or development of the T regulatory cells stated earlier in mice; however more research is needed to determine a definitive association in humans [177].
          A clinical trial performed on non-smoking asthmatic patients showed higher vitamin D levels were associated with greater lung function; furthermore, supplementation with vitamin D showed improved treatment response to glucocorticoids [182]. Vitamin D may also directly increase the anti-inflammatory cytokine, interleukin (IL)-10 and also enhance steroid-induced IL-10 production (see &#x25D8; Fig. 51.6) [177]. More research is needed to determine the exact mechanism of vitamin D in asthma and respiratory disease.Fig. 51.6Effect of asthma treatments on regulatory pathways.

           Conventional Assessments
           Beta-agonists, combined with corticosteroids, serve as the primary conventional therapy [183]. Typically, a short-acting beta-agonist will first be prescribed to manage symptoms as needed, where low-dose inhaled corticosteroids may also be prescribed [156]. If symptoms persist, it is recommended to evaluate problems such as adherence to use, inhaler technique, or persistent allergen exposure and comorbidities [156]. Once these are ruled out, the step-up treatment is a combination of an inhaled corticosteroid with a long-acting beta-agonist [156]. A summary of other conventional treatments and their mechanisms can be found in &#x25D8; Table 51.5 below.Table 51.5Conventional medications used in the treatment of asthmaMedication typeMedication nameMechanismShort-acting &#x3B2;2-agonists (inhaled)AlbuterolLevalbuterolPirbuterolCounteract the inhibitory effect on the beta-2 adrenergic receptor resulting in dilation of bronchial passages and relaxation of bronchial smooth muscle; lasts for 4&#x2013;6 hoursLong-acting &#x3B2;2-agonists (inhaled)BambuterolFormoterolSalmeterolSame as short acting, except effect lasts for about 12 hoursCorticosteroids (oral and inhaled)Inhaled:&#x2003;Budesonide&#x2003;Flunisolide&#x2003;Fluticasone propionate MometasoneOral:&#x2003;Dexamethasone&#x2003;Hydrocortisone&#x2003;Methylprednisolone&#x2003;PrednisoloneBind to glucocorticoid receptor which leads to expression of anti-inflammatory proteins, some of which block expression of pro-inflammatory modulatorsAnticholinergics/muscarinic antagonistsIpratropium bromideBlocks acetylcholine, which leads to dilation of bronchial airways and relaxation of bronchial smooth muscleLeukotriene antagonistsMontelukastZafirlukastBlock binding of leukotrienes to receptors on bronchial cellsOral methylxanthinesTheophyllineOxtriphyllineMethyl xanthine found in teaUsed less commonly due to side effectsRelaxes airways due to inhibition of phosphodiesterases; acts as a functional antagonist in airway smooth muscle [171]Based on data from Ref. [18]
          Unfortunately, conventional methods for the treatment of asthma may have harmful side effects. For example, the use of systemic glucocorticoids may lead to immunosuppression, cataracts, and osteoporosis, where long-acting beta-agonists have the potential of increasing asthma exacerbation risk and death [25]. Beta-agonist desensitization is thought to be one of the reasons for increasing asthma exacerbation risk and death [184].

           Integrative and Functional Medical Nutrition Therapy (IFMNT) Assessment of Asthma
          Related to several subtypes of asthma and their differing pathophysiologies, it is important to first determine the subtype before deciding on treatment. For example, in an individual with allergic asthma, this could be a potentially simple fix once the allergen that exacerbates symptoms is identified. A more conventional approach may involve starting the individual on an inhaled corticosteroid or an IgE antagonist (i.e., omalizumab) [159], rather than identifying the root cause of the patient&#x2019;s symptoms. While medications may be warranted until the trigger is identified, finding the underlying causes may not be common practice in many conventional settings.
          In contrast, the IFMNT assessment takes a much deeper dive into identifying triggers and any nutrient insufficiencies, inflammation or immune dysregulation, biochemical individuality, lifestyle, energy dysfunction, toxic load, sleep, and stress issues are taken into account. With this information, the practitioner can make more targeted dietary, lifestyle, and supplement recommendations to obtain sustained resolution of symptoms by treating the root cause (&#x25D8; Table 51.6, &#x25D8; Fig. 51.7, &#x25BA; Box 51.3).Table 51.6Summary of an integrative and functional medical nutrition therapy assessmentNutrient insufficienciesIntake-digestion-utilization (IDU):&#x2003;Adequacy of nutrient-dense foods to begin to assess nutritional status&#x2003;Organic or nonorganic to assess toxic load and nutrient intake&#x2003;Food preparation and processing to assess nutrient content and identify potential contaminants (e.g., plastic endocrine disruptors)&#x2003;Assess food sensitivities or intolerances to identify potential triggers&#x2003;Microbiome status: assess comprehensive digestive stool analysis for microbiology and fermented food intake; history of antibiotics or microbiota agonists (medications, toxins, stress, etc.)&#x2003;Toxin intake via plastics or inhalation and skin absorption which may affect immune response&#x2003;Assess flavonoids intake as they are antioxidant and anti-inflammatory compounds with mast cell inhibitory action; adequacy may reduce airway reactivity&#x2003;Consider celiac disease and gluten intake as potential inflammatory antigensMineral&#x2003;Assess and restore zinc, selenium, magnesium, manganese, iron, and iodine status to normal reference.

           IFMNT Case Study : Asthma

            Client Overview
            A 26-year-old female presented with a complaint of reactive airway disease, which was diagnosed as asthma and had been prescribed inhalers. She reported that she felt like she had difficulty breathing most of her life, especially when exercising. However, her condition was not severe enough to seek help until she was 25 years of age. She reported a lot of stress during this time related to applying for a postgraduate training position. She also reported 1 year prior to diagnosis developing new allergic symptoms.
            Her past medical history was significant for conditions related to airways, including chronic sinus infections, strep throat, bronchitis, and recurrent pneumonia.
            She could not remember the last time she felt well but assumed it was sometime as a young child. Her nutrition and health goals were to breathe better and to not have to rely on inhalers. The following data was collected on her initial visit.

             Follow-Up 

Patient presented ~6 months after the initial visit (September 2015). Her breathing had improved immensely. She was able to stop taking her Albuterol inhaler before exercise, recently stopped daily inhaler.After dairy-free diet for 3 months, reintroduced dairy (cheese, butter, yogurt). Asthmatic symptoms returned about 2&#x2013;3 days after the addition of each. Noticed the more dairy consumed, the worse her symptoms became.At time of appointment, diet whole foods, gluten-free, and dairy-free. Weight loss 10 lb within the first month of going dairy-free, continued to lose some weight. When reintroduced dairy symptoms of bloating and increase in weight, which resolved returning to dairy-free diet.BMs are regular now at ~ 2 &#xD7; daily.

             Outcome 
            This patient case followed some common patterns in the development of chronic disease and the comorbidities that are common, especially autoimmune conditions like asthma. The first is the genetic susceptibility of the individual; several SNPs are prone to dairy sensitivity. Second, significant evidence for gut dysbiosis, promoted compromised gut barrier, can contribute to the development of dairy sensitivity. Third is the exposure to dairy protein antigen. Diet history evidenced trigger for asthmatic condition.
            Additionally, inflammation , immune dysfunction, and methylation issues present. Signs and symptoms significant for decrease in PGE1 series anti-inflammatory pathways. Low dietary omega-3s potential contributor to asthma. Immune dysfunction evidenced by extensive history of infection-antibiotic use. Genomic SNP MTHFR C667T gene, which indicated a greater need for folate. The use of Yaz birth control and symptoms of depression, anxiety, and ADD known further to deplete B6 and folate.
            The diet and supplements recommended targeted control of inflammation, restore gut ecology, promote proper methylation, and replete nutrient insufficiencies. Results from 6-month follow-up showed successful outcome in helping improve breathing and wean her off of inhalers.
            This case is an example of the IFMNT approach able to address the complexity of the whole patient story and bring the metabolic priorities into a manageable intervention program for the individual.

        Chronic Infection and Respiratory Health

           Upper Respiratory Tract Infection
          One study found that the composition of the nasopharyngeal microbiota in children was linked to the frequency of upper respiratory tract infections and acute sinusitis [189]. A study that intranasally inoculated mice with Lactobacillus fermentum reduced the amount of S. pneumoniae in the respiratory tract and increased the number of macrophages in the lung and lymphocytes in the trachea [189]. These findings may indicate a benefit of manipulating the upper respiratory tract microbiota with orally or nasally administered probiotics in the prevention and/or treatment of upper respiratory tract infections.

           Fungal, Viral, and Bacterial Infections
           Allergic bronchopulmonary mycosis (ABPM) is caused by a hypersensitivity reaction to fungal colonization of the airways. This is typically caused by the fungus Aspergillus fumigatus. Without treatment this may lead to fixed airflow obstruction and bronchiectasis [159].
           Guillain-Barre syndrome (GBS) is a rare neurological disorder in which the body&#x2019;s immune system attacks the peripheral nervous system, known as the network of nerves located outside of the brain and spinal cord [190]. It is often preceded by a bacterial or viral infection. There are several potential mechanisms in which these infections trigger GBS. If an individual contracts a Campylobacter jejuni bacterial infection, antibodies made to fight this infection can attack axons in motor nerves, which can potentially cause paralysis and respiratory failure [190]. Campylobacter can be ingested via contaminated food or other exposures [190].
          P&#xE9;rez-Guzm&#xE1;n 2005 states that hypocholesterolemia is common among tuberculosis patients and suggests that cholesterol should be used as a complementary measure in antitubercular treatment [8].

        Alpha-1 Antitrypsin Deficiency (A1AT Deficiency)
        Alpha-1 antitrypsin (A1AT) deficiency is an underrecognized disease in the United States, with around documented 100,000 people suffering from it, according to the Alpha-1 Foundation. This deficiency is inherited through autosomal codominant transmission, meaning affected individuals have inherited an abnormal AAT gene from each parent [191]. Individuals with this deficient allele present with AAT levels at less than 35% to low-end normal levels [191].
        However, it is also possible for individuals with a variant of this allele to be asymptomatic given different environmental conditions or lifestyle factors, such as refraining from smoking to reduce lung disease development risk [191] (&#x25BA; Box 51.4).

           Lungs 
          A1AT deficiency most often manifests in the lungs as chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) (i.e., emphysema or bronchiectasis or &#x201C;genetic COPD&#x201D;). A1AT deficiency is often undiagnosed because people with genetic COPD experience the same symptoms as people with COPD, such as [191]:Shortness of breathWheezingRecurring chest coldsLow exercise toleranceYear-round allergies
          The only way you will know for sure if you have genetic COPD due to alpha-1 is to get tested.
          ________

           Liver 
          A1AT deficiency can manifest in the liver as cirrhosis.

            Symptoms Related to the Liver 

Unexplained liver disease or elevated liver enzymesEyes and skin turning yellow (jaundice)Swelling of the abdomen (ascites) or legsVomiting blood (from enlarged veins in the esophagus or stomach)

           Skin 
          A1AT expresses sometimes in the skin as panniculitis [191]. Panniculitis typically appears as raised red spots on the skin, which may break down and give off an oily discharge. While panniculitis spots (called nodules) may appear anywhere on the body, the most common places are the thighs, buttocks, and areas subject to injury or pressure.

           A1AT Biochemical Mechanisms 
          The alpha-1 antitrypsin (A1AT) protein protects the body, especially fragile lung tissues, from the damaging effects of a powerful enzyme called neutrophil elastase that is released from white blood cells. In A1AT deficiency, a genetic mutation reduces levels of the protective protein in the bloodstream. A1AT deficiency can lead to chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), specifically emphysema, and liver disease. Smoking, which can inhibit what little A1AT protein an affected person does have, increases the risk of lung disease.
          Alpha-1 antitrypsin deficiency is completely determined by mutations in a single gene. The severity of symptoms is mostly a function of which mutations a person has and how many copies. However, smoking can greatly increase the risk of lung disease due to AAT mutations.
          23andMe reports data only for the PI&#x2217;M, PI&#x2217;S, and PI&#x2217;Z versions of the gene that encodes AAT. Keep in mind that it is possible to have another mutation that causes this condition that is not included in this report [192]. A1AT deficiency is a genetic disorder that reduces circulating levels of a protein that protects the lungs by trapping A1AT in the liver, where the protein is produced, and prevents A1AT from entering circulation. A1AT deficiency can lead to chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), specifically emphysema, and liver disease.
          When a disease-causing mutation is fairly common, as the PI&#x2217;S and PI&#x2217;Z mutations are in Europeans, it suggests that the mutation actually conferred an evolutionary advantage at one time. Some researchers have suggested that several thousand years ago when the PI&#x2217;Z and PI&#x2217;S mutations first arose, these versions of the gene for A1AT gave people a survival advantage by creating an environment in their lungs that helped fight off infections. The scientists theorize that the antimicrobial benefits of the AAT mutations outweighed the cost of an increased risk of COPD and liver disease in the era before antibiotics were available [193].

           Liver Cirrhosis 
          In contrast to lung disease, manifestation of liver disease related to A1AT can be referred to as a &#x201C;toxic gain of function,&#x201D; due to accumulation of mutant A1AT protein rather than protease deficiency within the liver [144].

        Pulmonary Fibrosis

          Overview
          When taken together, fibrotic lung diseases are the leading cause of mortality worldwide. Under the umbrella of interstitial lung disease (ILD), pulmonary fibrosis (PF) is the most common. Any ILD that involves scarring of the lungs falls in the pulmonary fibrosis category. Pulmonary fibrosis is the scarring of lungs, which destroys tissue over time, making it impossible to transfer oxygen from inhaled air into the bloodstream. There are more than 200 different diseases under the pulmonary fibrosis umbrella. Because PF is often misdiagnosed or goes undiagnosed, there is not an accurate count of those with these diseases. However, it is estimated that as many as 1 in 200 adults over 60, or 200,000 people in the United States, are affected [184]. There are more than 50,000 deaths from IPF every year in the United States. More people die each year from idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis than from breast cancer [194].
          There are other forms of interstitial lung disease including the newly identified pleuroparenchymal fibroelastosis, cryptogenic organizing pneumonia (COP), desquamative interstitial pneumonitis, nonspecific interstitial pneumonitis, hypersensitivity pneumonitis, acute interstitial pneumonitis, interstitial pneumonia, sarcoidosis, and asbestosis [195].
           Symptoms include cough and dyspnea, restrictive pulmonary function tests with impaired gas exchange, and progressive lung scarring. The disease progresses with an initiation of inflammation. Fibrosing starts with the action of transforming growth factor-&#x3B2; (TGF-&#x3B2;)-dependent differentiation of fibroblasts to myofibroblasts, which then express &#x3B1;-SMA (smooth muscle actin) [196].
          After the TGF-&#x3B2;-dependent differentiation of fibroblasts to myofibroblasts, which express &#x3B1;-SMA, there is sustained, excessive deposition of collagen by the myofibroblasts in the lung interstitium leading to the progressive lung damage in patients with PF [185]. Research published in 2011 supported the idea that dysfunctional type II AECs (alveolar epithelial cells) facilitate lung fibrosis through increased susceptibility to injury, leading to excessive and dysregulated remodeling [197]. The disease seems to progress in steps, and inflammation is not typically present continuously, except during certain periodic episodes of deterioration (&#x25D8; Fig. 51.8).Fig. 51.8The cellular and molecular mechanisms of fibrosis in multiple organs. The cellular and molecular mechanisms of fibrosis in multiple organs. Once an injury occurs in an organ, epithelial and/or endothelial cells are impaired, which results in the release of chemokines and growth factors, including IL-13 and TGF-b1. Macrophages and monocytes are recruited and activated, both of which further release cytokines and chemokines and further induce fibroblast activation. Activated fibroblasts transform into a-SMA-expressing myofibroblasts and migrate into the wound along the fibrin lattice. ECM is excessively accumulated, and some parenchymal cells (hepatic stellate cells in the liver, tubular epithelial cells in the kidney, alveolar epithelial cells in the lung, or cardiomyocytes in the heart) are further differentiated into myofibroblasts or fibroblasts by the stimulation of cytokines and chemokines, especially for TGF-b1. After the inflammatory phase, two events occur. One is the regeneration of injured tissues followed by wound contraction and reepithelialization. In contrast, once chronic injury, inflammation, and necrosis occur, myofibroblasts are perpetually activated, and excessive ECM is deposited, finally resulting in fibrosis formation.

          There are five main categories of PF causes : drug-induced, radiation-induced, environmental, autoimmune, and occupational. Of these five, four have identifiable causes. Some of the autoimmune diseases that can lead to PF are rheumatoid arthritis, scleroderma, Sjogren&#x2019;s syndrome, polymyositis, dermatomyositis, and antisynthetase syndrome.
           Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (ILP) is defined as PF with an unknown cause, including a genetic cause for some families [see &#x25D8; Fig. 51.9]. The symptoms of ILP are a dry, hacking cough, shortness of breath, fatigue, chest discomfort, loss of appetite, and unexplained weight loss, all caused by the fibrosing of the lungs.Fig. 51.9Summary of common genetic variants linked to (IPF). (Reproduced with permission of the &#xA9; ERS 2019: European Respiratory Journal 33(1):99&#x2013;106. &#x25BA; 10.1183/09031936.00091607. Published 31 December 2008)
          Diagnosis can be difficult, and PF is often misdiagnosed as COPD or other more common lung diseases. In addition, in the recent past, path to a true diagnosis was invasive. Since damage to the lungs, even through a diagnostic biopsy, can trigger further lung damage or a period of fibrosis, many physicians or patients are cautious with a biopsy approach to diagnosis. Since the current treatments are limited, one must evaluate whether defining the exact form of PF is necessary for treatment and follow-up. Difficulty breathing, crackling sounds while breathing, and low oxygen levels are the first indicators. Clubbed fingernails may also be a symptom.
          High-resolution CT scans are performed, which can show scarring. The pulmonologist will ask many questions and order more blood tests to try to distinguish between the 200 forms of PF. The future is pointing to molecular endotyping as a more accurate way to diagnose. Molecular endotyping includes genetic, metabolic, transcriptional, and environmental factors to help determine the pathophysiology [199].
          Genetic research has been progressing for a couple decades with illuminating results. There are more than a dozen genetic variants that have been associated with this family of diseases. Researchers now believe at least 20% of idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) patients with multiple family members suffering from IPF have some common familial genetic variants, which may allow researchers to eventually drop the term idiopathic and further define various forms or categories, with differing progression or outcome. The name given to this version of interstitial pneumonias is familial interstitial pneumonia (FIP) [200] [see &#x25D8; Fig. 51.10].Fig. 51.10Rare genetic variants linked to familial interstitial pneumonia (FIP). (Reproduced with permission of the &#xA9; ERS 2019: European Respiratory Journal. 33(1):99&#x2013;106. &#x25BA; 10.1183/09031936.00091607. Published 31 December 2008)
          Currently two categories of genetic focus have been defined: those genes related to telomere biology (shorter telomeres) and those related to surfactant protein processing. The genes related to shorter telomeres are TERT, TERC, hTR, DKC1, and RTEL1. More mutations have been found in the TERT gene, which encodes the protein component of telomerase, than any other gene. Further research may allow targeted therapies to affect the genetic expression associated with the development of IPF [201, 202]. A common variant within the promoter of the MUC5B gene is the most replicated single-nucleotide polymorphism related to familial and sporadic forms of IPF as well as early radiographic findings of IPF [203] (&#x25D8; Figs. 51.9 and 51.10).

          Conventional Treatment
           Conventional treatment is typically palliative. The American Thoracic Society recognizes that supplemental oxygen and transplantation are the only suggested treatments for IPF. Supplemental oxygen is prescribed, and the need for oxygen increases over the progression of the disease. Keeping the oxygen saturation level over 90% (normal is in the upper 90s) is ideal and is how healthcare providers determine the level of supplemental oxygen to be used. Cardiovascular exercise, in this case called pulmonary rehabilitation, is recommended to maintain as much use of the lungs as possible.
          Infrequently, nutrition and counseling are recommended and are placed into the category of symptom management. Nutrition can have a significant role in the management of this disease, but little implementation exists in some of the proposed protocols.
          There are currently two medications available in the United States with minor impact on the disease progression: nintedanib (commonly called Ofev) and pirfenidone (Esbriet). Histopathological quantification showed similar amounts of dense collagen fibrosis, fibroblast foci, and alveolar macrophages in untreated or pirfenidone- or nintedanib-treated IPF patients [204]. Both have significant side effects, including fatigue and GI issues, and patients may have to evaluate their quality of life versus length of life. Other anti-inflammatories or immune-suppressing medications used are corticosteroids, mycophenolate mofetil/mycophenolic acid (CellCept&#xAE;), or azathioprine (Imuran&#xAE;). Immune-suppressing drugs may be harmful for those with short telomeres, and researchers are exploring this potentially contradictory recommendation [205].
          Lung transplantation is a final effort. About 1,000 lung transplants in the United States go to those with PF, which is half of all transplants. With the prevalence of this disease closer to 200,000, this is a small fraction of those with the disease. Some of those with the transplant go on to live productive lives, while others develop PF again, in the transplanted lungs. Overall, there is a shorter life expectancy in those with PF, because of telomere shortening. Bone marrow or immune response abnormalities have been found in some IPF cases before and after lung transplantation, which increases the associated morbidity.

           Integrative and Functional Nutrition Medical Therapy 
          As stated above, inflammation occurs at the beginning and throughout the progression of all fibrosing diseases, including those of the lungs. Therefore, reducing inflammation is one wise strategy to slow fibrosing. There are several nutrients that can help slow or reverse the inflammation involved in the fibrosing process. The following two-part diagram shows where in the fibrosing pathogenesis each phytonutrient acts [198] (&#x25D8; Fig. 51.11).Fig. 51.11Antifibrosis therapy. The molecular mechanisms and therapeutic targets of natural products against fibrosis. a TGF-b exerts a profibrotic effect through Smad-dependent [Target (1)] and Smad-independent pathways [Target (2)]. In the Smad-dependent pathway, TGF-b1 directly phosphorylates and activates the downstream mediator Smad2 and Smad3 through TGF-b receptor I, and then Smad2 and Smad3 bind Smad4, which forms a complex that moves into the nucleus and initiates gene transcription. Smad7, transcribed by Smad3, is a negative regulator of TGF-b/Smad signaling, and the imbalance between Smad3 and Smad7 contributes to fibrosis. PI3K, ERK, and p38 MAPK are downstream mediators of the Smad-independent TGF-b pathway. PPARg [Target (3)] could inhibit TGF-b to reduce fibrosis, while CTGF [Target (4)], a matricellular protein, contributes to wound healing and virtually all fibrotic pathology. Additionally, Gas6 contributes to fibrosis through the TAM receptor, which further activates the PI3K/Akt pathway. Similarly, LPA triggers fibrosis through the LPA1 receptor [Target (5)] that stimulates b-catenin to induce fibrogenesis. The activation of the hedgehog pathway [Target (6)] induces the transcriptional activity of Gli to express target genes, which have an important role in interstitial fibrosis, undergoing myofibroblast transformation and proliferation. IL pathway [Target (7)] stimulates NF-kB [Target (8)] to activate TGF-b to induce fibrogenesis, while Nrf2 [Target (9)] antagonizes NF-kB activity to protect against fibrosis. b The chemical structures of isolated compounds and their therapeutic targets are presented.

          A few of those compounds are discussed in more detail here.
           Curcumin , the active constituent in the common spice turmeric, has been shown to reduce fibrotic activity in several studies. In mice, curcumin inhibited collagen secretion of IPF fibroblasts. It affects the signaling of TGF-&#x3B2;, in a dose-specific manner, resulting in reduced expression of &#x3B1;-SMA, which is responsible for inappropriate fibrosing. This was shown in vitro and in vivo in mice, with intraperitoneal, but not oral, administration. At the time of the study, oral ingestion of curcumin was not adequately absorbed into plasma, and there was greater than ten times plasma concentration of curcumin following an intraperitoneal injection [88]. However, some new oral products on the market are showing greater absorption.
          The results of this study suggest more research into curcumin , including improved delivery into patients. For example, some delivery options may include nebulized curcumin directly into the lungs, binding it to highly absorbable agents for oral use or liposome-encapsulated curcumin suitable for intravenous use (already shown to be effective in an animal model).
          According to manufacturers of curcumin products, some are more readily absorbed than others. One study on fibrosing suggested that a dose of around 2200 mg curcumin split into three doses taken with meals including pepper (bioperine) achieved doses that were sufficient to exert the desired therapeutic effect.
          Research into using quercetin also has some promising results in slowing the progression of IPF. Quercetin reversed lung fibrosing in mice and reversed the disease progression normally caused by typical pulmonary senescence markers [206].
          It is worth mentioning that N-acetylcysteine (NAC), a long-used therapeutic agent for breaking down mucus in the lungs, has not been found to be effective in those with IPF. In fact, due to its acidic nature, it has even been shown to be harmful when used in the inhaled form [207].
          Several of the drugs being developed have a natural product as a model or foundation. Until a drug or gene therapy is developed that stops or reverses this disease, it may make sense for the patient to focus on anti-inflammation and reducing myofibroblast activation, the extracellular matrix (ECM) accumulation, and the epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) process. The phytochemicals listed in &#x25D8; Fig. 51.11 would be good ones to investigate.

           Genetics and Telomeres 
          With the recent identification of genes associated with ILD, a call for gene-related therapies both related to telomere lengthening and connective tissue disease has been initiated, and this type of therapy, as with any disease, could be personalized [208]. One recent study looked at various biomarker values as a more precise way of diagnosing. The biomarker molecules were classified according to their involvement into alveolar epithelial cell injury, fibroproliferation, and matrix remodeling as well as immune regulation. Furthermore, genetic variants of TOLLIP, MUC-5B, and other genes associated with a differential response to treatment and with the development and/or the prognosis of IPF were identified. Research into personalized medicine for treatment is starting [209].
          Although controversial, because of the lack of research on interpretation of the results, telomere length testing is available directly to consumers and through healthcare practitioners. There are a few different methods: quantitative polymerase chain reaction, or qPCR, which has a 20% variability rate, and flow cytometry and fluorescent in situ hybridization, or Flow-FISH, which has a 5% variability rate. Most research labs use Flow-FISH for research.
          Telomere length is a hot topic in research, the antiaging industry, and with popular health blogs. Shorter-than-average telomeres have also been linked to heart disease and heart failure [163, 210, 211], cancer [212], diabetes [213], and osteoporosis [214]. Research has shown ways to slow telomere shortening. Some include reducing stress, meditation, practicing loving kindness (a technique encouraging compassion) [215], reducing exposure to air pollution and toxins [216], cardiovascular exercise [217], and a healthy fat and high vegetable diet [218, 219]. One study showed that 45 minutes of cardiovascular exercise three times per week resulted in longer telomeres representing 10 years of biological age, similar to those of marathon runners, compared to those who didn&#x2019;t exercise much or at all [220]. Intermittent fasting, which reduces oxidative stress and keeps weight in check, has exploded in the scientific literature as a way to increase longevity and slow telomere shortening [221, 222].
           Nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD+) supplements may also help maintain telomere length by activating sirtuins, the antiaging enzymes; PARPs, which are involved in DNA repair; and CD38, which plays a role in insulin production. Another supplement, cycloastragenol, derived from the herb astragalus, has also been shown to activate telomerase in mice. An ingredient called TA-65 has been derived and is used in supplements [223].
          Overall, a healthy lifestyle and diet seem to delay the shortening of telomeres . With relation to PF, the gene mutations involved in telomere shortening may or may not be influenced by the above interventions. More research is needed for this.
          Pulmonary fibrosis is a devastating disease with no management or a known cure. The integrative and functional medicine nutritionist can help her/his patient by managing weight, encouraging a healthy diet full of anti-inflammatory foods and encouraging a healthy lifestyle with exercise and stress reduction. There is some promising research into natural supplement use to target the different areas of progression within the disease process and some ongoing drug and gene therapy development to follow.

        Box 51.3 What Is the Inflammatory Influence of Periostin on Tissues and Organs?
        Periostin plays a role in the pathogenesis of allergic diseases, including asthma, as it is associated as a downstream molecule of the cytokine, IL-13. Periostin is used as a biomarker for type 2 immunity and can be used to determine the potential effectiveness of medications used to treat asthma, such as anti-IgE antibodies and anti-IL-13 antibodies. Asthmatic patients with high serum periostin tend to be aspirin intolerant, eosinophilic, late asthma onset, and have a high nitric oxide fraction. High periostin can also indicate a reduced response to inhaled corticosteroids [186, 224].

        Normal genotype M MMost common abnormal genes are called S and ZAbnormal variant combinations:ZZ (highest risk)SZ (lower risk increasing if smoker, inhalant pollutants)MZ (lower risk of carrying an A1AT gene variant; considered &#x201C;carriers&#x201D;)Alpha-1 is the most commonly known genetic risk factor for emphysemaUp to 3% of all people diagnosed with COPD may have undetected Alpha-1Alpha-1 can also lead to liver disease. The most serious liver diseases are cirrhosis and liver cancerThe World Health Organization (WHO), American Thoracic Society (ATS), and the European Respiratory Society (ERS) recommend that everyone with COPD be tested for Alpha-1
        Alpha-1 is a progressive disease that benefits from early detection. It can cause serious lung diseases, such as COPD and emphysema when undiagnosed. In some cases, Alpha-1 can also cause liver disease [225]

      Conclusion
      The prevalence of lung disease in the United States and worldwide is growing and will continue to grow rapidly with the deterioration of Earth&#x2019;s atmosphere, which is caused by pollutants such as industrial and construction toxins and volcanic and wildfire particulates. Poor maternal, childhood, and adult nutrition from micronutrient-poor diets resulting in nutrient insufficiencies, not necessarily nutrient deficiencies, is also contributing to increased lung disease diagnoses or poorer results during treatment [226, 227]. Lifestyle choices and habits also play a role in the development of many of the lung diseases in today&#x2019;s world, such as smoking or vaping, which uses chemicals that are poorly studied to date. Other lung diseases have their roots in genetics.
      Some key processes drive many lung diseases, with the inflammatory process being the most important, according to current literature. Nutrition can be of great help with inflammation, using a diet rich in whole foods providing micronutrients and phytonutrients. Understanding genetics is also key to unraveling the causes and potential future treatments for many lung diseases. Those patients with both genetic and environmental determinants, such as in those who smoke and have genes associated with COPD, are at the greatest risk [228].
      Despite the prevalence of lung disease, there is a general lack of nutrition knowledge among practitioners, including familiarity with the research about the use of nutrition for prevention, slowing disease progression, or as a treatment of lung disease. Historically, nutrition has been used in a supportive role, primarily monitoring macronutrients to prevent weight loss, muscle atrophy, and acid/alkaline balance. Although this is extremely important, more attention needs to be directed toward emphasizing micronutrients and phytonutrients. Research is strong regarding the benefits of vitamins, minerals, and pre- and probiotics, and indeed, some integrative and functional practitioners are using vitamin and mineral nutritional therapy in oral, intramuscular, and intravenous applications, when allowed, in practice. A newer area of research is around nutraceuticals, including targeted vitamins, minerals, and plant-derived constituents concentrated to therapeutic doses. Some exciting research around the use of curcumin and quercetin, for example, has been shown to dampen inflammation to the point of disrupting the disease process (see above). The expanding knowledge of the microbiome is identifying the importance of the lung and airway microbiome in respiratory health.
      More research, and indeed more education for nutritionists around the existing research, is needed to fully understand the best opportunities for the use of nutrition in the treatment or prevention of lung disease.
