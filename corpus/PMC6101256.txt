Food frequency questionnaires (FFQs) are often used to estimate food
and nutrient intakes to rank individuals by their level of intake. We
evaluated the relative validity of a semi-quantitative FFQ created for use
in Tanzania by comparing it to two 24-hour diet recalls.

Design
We measured relative validity of the FFQ with deattenuated
energy-adjusted rank correlations for nutrients, deattenuated rank
correlations for food groups, and performed a cross-classification analysis
of energy-adjusted nutrient quartiles using percent agreement, and
Bland-Altman analysis.

Setting
Interviews were conducted in 2014 in participants’ homes in
Ukonga, Dar es Salaam, Tanzania.

Subjects
We surveyed 317 adults aged 40 years and older from the general
public.

Results
Deattenuated energy-adjusted rank correlation coefficients of
nutrients ranged from −0.03 for riboflavin to 0.41 for percent
energy from carbohydrates with a median correlation of 0.21. Coefficients
for food groups ranged from 0.00 for root vegetables to 0.51 for alcohol,
with a median of 0.35. Relative to the average of the two 24-hour diet
recalls, the FFQ overestimated energy intake and intake of all nutrients and
food groups, other than tea, with ratios among nutrients ranging from 1.34
for saturated fatty acids to 7.08 for Vitamin A; and among food groups from
0.92 for tea to 9.00 for fruit. The percentage of participants classified in
the same nutrient intake quartile ranged from 23% for saturated
fatty acids to 32% for both niacin and pantothenic acid, with a
median of 28%.

Conclusions
The FFQ performed moderately well in urban Tanzanian adults.

   Introduction
Non-communicable diseases (NCDs) are a growing concern in sub-Saharan Africa
(SSA). In this region, the number of cardiovascular deaths has nearly doubled from
1990 to 2015(1), the prevalence of diabetes
has more than doubled from 1980 to 2014(2),
and the prevalence of hypertension and obesity are both increasing(3,4). In rural SSA,
the proportion of adult deaths due to NCDs has increased: from 16% in 2003
to 24% in 2007 in Tanzania(5) and from
35% in 2003 to 45% in 2010 in Kenya(6)

One of the potentially modifiable risk factors for NCDs is diet, which is
well-documented to affect the risk for many cardiometabolic diseases and
cancers(7-10). In sub-Saharan Africa (SSA), although data remain sparse, it is
clear that access to food is increasing, but diet quality is worsening. Data from
the Food and Agricultural Organization of the United Nations (FAO) show that per
capita caloric intake has increased over the past 30 years(11), snack food and soft drink importation to the 15
countries that make up the Southern African Development Community (SADC) has
quadrupled over the past two decades(12), and
overall dietary quality has worsened(13).
Reflecting the consequences of the worsening dietary situation in SSA, the Global
Burden of Disease (GBD) study estimates that the proportion of deaths attributable
to unhealthy diet in Tanzania has increased from 5.8% in 1990 to
9.3% in 2015(14,15).

As the burden of NCDs in SSA continues to grow, more research is needed to
discover the causes of this rising burden and help governments develop prevention
policies. Well-designed public health policies could influence diet through such
means as education to inform and change food preferences, healthy food production,
food subsidization, and taxation(16–19). However,
obtaining reliable information on dietary intake can be challenging because
validated tools for quantifying diet in SSA are limited. Food frequency
questionnaires (FFQs) are the standard tool used to estimate dietary intake for
diet-disease analyses in large cohorts(20).
Such questionnaires, which were developed in the 1980s, have been widely used by
researchers in the United States and Europe. However, as the validity of food
frequency questionnaires is sensitive to cultural and regional factors(20–22), FFQs need to be validated before being extended for use outside of
the United States and Europe, such as in SSA where diets, availability of foods and
dishes, portion sizes, numeracy, literacy, and customs differ from those in the U.S.
and Europe(23,24). Within SSA, full-length FFQs intended to measure the entire diet
have been validated for use in Mali, South Africa, and Botswana(25–29).
However, diets differ between sub-Saharan African countries, and an FFQ has not yet
been validated for use in Tanzania. A previous validation of a Tanzanian FFQ against
two 24-hour diet recalls only provided correlation coefficients and p-values for six
broad food groups (fruits, cereals, beverages, vegetables, animal products, and
fats) based on data from 50 women(30). Here,
we report the validity of estimated intakes of energy, 25 nutrients, and 13 food
groups as assessed by our FFQ compared to two repeated 24-hour diet recalls among
adults in Dar es Salaam, Tanzania.

Methods
Sampling design and participants
The Dar es Salaam Health and Demographic Surveillance System (HDSS) was
initiated in 2011 and collected demographic data on all individuals living in
Ukonga, a peri-urban ward of Dar es Salaam(31). For the Dar es Salaam Urban Cohort Hypertension Study
(DUCS-HTN), we attempted to contact everyone registered in the HDSS, aged 40
years and older, from two randomly selected neighborhoods of the seven
neighborhoods in the HDSS (n=4,896). Additional information on the
DUCS-HTN study has been reported previously(32). We randomly selected 1,024 of these potential participants to
contact for the DUCS-HTN dietary sub-study. We excluded participants who were
pregnant or physically or mentally incapable of participating in the DUCS-HTN
study. For inclusion in the analytical sample, we required that participants
complete an FFQ and two 24-hour diet recalls, have less than 10% of
their FFQ items missing, and that their daily caloric intake from the FFQ be
within a plausible range of 500 to 5000 kcal.

The Institutional Review Board of the Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public
Health and the Muhimbili University of Health and Allied Sciences Ethical
Committee approved the study protocol. Written informed consent was obtained
from all participants, or, if the participant was unable to sign, a witness
signed on behalf of the participant.

Dietary assessments
Trained interviewers conducted face-to-face interviews and physical
examinations in participants’ homes from March to June 2014. The six
interviewers who conducted dietary questionnaires had experience in public
health data collection, but not in collecting FFQs or 24-hour diet recalls. The
interviewers, therefore, received one full day of training and written
instructions on how to conduct the FFQ and 24-hour diet recall. A nutritionist
and epidemiologists conducted the dietary data collection training. Interviewers
had two days of field practice before commencing data collection, during which
supervisors observed interviews and provided feedback to the interviewers in
order to standardize the interview technique between the six interviewers.
Interviewers administered the FFQ and the first 24-hour diet recall at the first
study visit. All interviews and exams proceeded in the same order: lifestyle
questionnaire, blood pressure measurements, FFQ, anthropometric measurements,
24-hour diet recall, capillary blood measurements, and finally provision of
instructions for the 24-hour urine collection. A second 24-hour diet recall was
repeated at the start of the next study visit, a minimum of three days later.
The median [interquartile range (IQR)] number of days between
the two 24-hour diet recalls was 6 [4, 15]. Eighty-four percent
of participants completed both 24-hour diet recalls during the workweek,
15% completed one on the weekend and one during the week, and 2%
completed both during the weekend.

Interviewers verbally administered the 24-hour diet recall to
participants. To help standardize participants’ understanding of serving
size, the interviewers showed participants plastic sample dishes as well as
drawn images of portion sizes (see images in Supplement) for the
24-hour diet recalls and the FFQ.

Interviewers verbally administered the 179-food-item semi-quantitative
FFQ with specified portion sizes and a recall period of 30 days. The FFQ was
slightly modified, through the addition of food items, from the FFQ created by
Lukmanji et al(33). Similar FFQs without
published validation studies have previously been used in Tanzania(34). There were nine options for frequency
of consumption, and servings per day were calculated from these frequencies as
follows: never consumed over past thirty days (0 servings per day), 1-3 servings
per month (0.067 servings per day), 1 serving per week (0.143 servings per day),
2-4 servings per week (0.429 servings per day), 5-6 servings per week (0.786
servings per day), 1 serving per day (1 serving per day), 2-3 servings per day
(2.5 servings per day), 4-5 servings per day (4.5 servings per day), 6+
servings per day (6 servings per day). Participants selected one frequency of
consumption for each of the 179 items in the FFQ. Portion sizes were provided
for each food item (see FFQ in Supplement); however, participants were allowed to report that they
consumed a portion of a serving size (e.g. ½ or ¼).

For both the 24-hour diet recall and FFQ data, nutrient information for
individual foods was taken from the 2008 Tanzania Food Composition Tables(35). The food composition tables were
primarily based on data from WorldFood Dietary Assessment System, with some
information also taken from the Unites States Department of Agriculture (USDA)
food composition database and the South Africa food composition tables. Chemical
analysis of the nutrient composition of a small number of foods (mainly maize
and some leafy greens) was conducted at Sokoine University of Agriculture. The
Tanzanian Food Composition Tables includes nutrient composition of mixed dishes.
The authors of the Tanzanian Food Composition Tables collected sample recipes
from a variety of sources (e.g. street food vendors, student canteen, recipes
books and websites). The nutrient composition of the recipes was then estimated
from the nutrient composition of the individual ingredients. These tables
provide information on the energy and nutrient content and grams per serving
size of over 400 foods and dishes commonly consumed in Tanzania. Nutrient
intakes for each individual included contributions from food but not
supplements.

Statistical analysis
Descriptive statistics (means and standard deviations (SDs)) were
calculated for energy, nutrient, and food group intakes as estimated by the FFQ
and the average of the two 24-hour diet recalls. Foods were categorized into 13
groups (Supplement Table
1) for food group analyses. Nutrient intakes were adjusted for total
energy intake using the residual method(36). We also adjusted for total energy intake when analyzing
macronutrient intake by calculating macronutrient intake as a percent of total
energy intake (i.e. the nutrient density method). Fats, carbohydrates, and
protein were also separately adjusted for total energy intake using the nutrient
density method.

Rank correlation coefficients and 95% confidence intervals were
calculated to evaluate the strength of associations between nutrient and food
group intakes derived from the FFQs versus the 24-hour diet recalls(37). To compare nutrient intake as measured
by the two different dietary assessment methods, we calculated unadjusted,
energy-adjusted, and deattenuated energy-adjusted correlation coefficients. To
compare food group intake as measured by the two different dietary assessment
methods, we calculated unadjusted and deattenuated correlation coefficients.
Deattenuated correlations were used to adjust for random within-person variation
across the 24-hour diet recalls(37). We
also calculated intra-class correlations (ICCs) between nutrient and food group
intake as measured by the FFQ and average of the two 24-hour diet recalls.

We also examined the ability of the two dietary questionnaires to
categorize participants into the same energy-adjusted nutrient intake quartiles.
The proportion of individuals that were classified correctly within the same
quartile, within the same or adjacent quartile, and in opposite quartiles
(lowest quartile according to one dietary questionnaire and highest quartile
according to the other) was determined. Kappa statistics with linear weights
were calculated to further quantify the agreement between energy-adjusted
nutrient intake quartiles as measured by the FFQ and average of two 24-hour diet
recalls(38,39).

We examined systematic differences in macronutrient intake as measured
by the FFQ and 24-hour diet recalls by creating Bland-Altman plots of energy
intake, percent energy from fat, percent energy from protein, and percent energy
from carbohydrates(40). The plots were
created by plotting the difference of nutrient intake from the two dietary
intake measurement methods against the mean of the nutrient intake from the two
dietary intake measurement methods. A relationship between the difference and
the mean values indicates systematic bias (e.g. the FFQ tends to overestimate
nutrient intake more for those with higher total energy intakes). Limits of
agreement (mean(nutrientFFQ − nutrient24hDR)
± 1.96*SD(nutrientFFQ −
nutrient24hDR)) were calculated and plotted.

Analyses were performed using SAS 9.3 (SAS Institute Inc., Cary, North
Carolina, USA). Figures were created using R 2.15.3(41).

Results
Among the 1,024 participants that we attempted to contact for the DUCS-HTN
dietary sub-study, 265 were not home after 3 contact attempts, 239 had outmigrated,
42 had died, 15 were mentally or physically incapable of participating, 36 refused
to participate, and 2 were pregnant (Figure 1),
resulting in a sample of 415 participants. Of these individuals, 414 completed the
FFQ and 357 also completed the two 24-hour diet recalls. None of the FFQs had
missing data on more than 10% of FFQ food items. We excluded one participant
who, according to the FFQ, consumed &lt;500 calories per day, as well as 39
participants who consumed more than 5,000 calories per day, which led to an
analytical sample of 317 participants. Among these, the median [IQR]
age was 52 [45, 60] years, 61% of participants were female,
65% were overweight or obese, and 75% had less than secondary
education (Table 1).

The intra-class correlations of the FFQ and average of the two 24-hour diet
recalls for nutrients ranged from 0.09 for Vitamin A to 0.38 for total energy and
for food groups it ranged from 0.12 for vegetables (excluding roots) to 0.58 for
tea. The mean daily energy, nutrient, and food intakes estimated by the FFQ were
higher than those estimated by the average of the two 24-hour diet recalls (Table 2). This was true for all nutrients and
all foods, other than tea. Total energy intake as estimated by the FFQ was 1.68
times that estimated by the average of the two 24-hour diet recalls: mean (standard
deviation) total energy intake was 2599 (1030) kcal according to the FFQ and 1546
(431) kcal according to the average of the two 24-hour diet recalls. The ratio of
nutrient intake comparing FFQ estimates to 24-hour diet recall estimates ranged from
1.34 for saturated fatty acids to 7.08 for Vitamin A. Among food groups, the ratio
of consumption comparing FFQ estimates to 24-hour diet recall estimates ranged from
0.92 for tea to 9.00 for fruits.

Energy-adjustment tended to reduce correlations and deattenuation tended to
increase correlations (Table 3). The median
deattenuated energy-adjusted correlation for nutrients was 0.21 and ranged from
−0.03 for riboflavin to 0.41 for percent energy from carbohydrates.
Macronutrients when measured as percent of total energy intake (i.e. the nutrient
density method) had higher correlations than did macronutrients adjusted for energy
using the residual method: 0.41 versus 0.25 for carbohydrates, 0.40 versus 0.22 for
protein, and 0.36 versus 0.15 for fat. The median deattenuated correlation for food
groups was 0.35 and ranged from 0.00 for root vegetables to 0.51 for alcohol.

Cross-classification analyses of estimated nutrient intake found low to
moderate agreement (Table 4). The median
proportion classified within the same quartile was 29%, which is higher than
the 25% that is expected due to chance alone. The proportion correctly
classified within the same quartile ranged from 23% for saturated fatty acid
to 32% for niacin and pantothenic acid. The proportion classified within the
same or adjacent quartiles ranged from 60% for riboflavin to 72% for
monounsaturated fatty acids. The proportion classified into opposite quartiles (Q1
according to one questionnaire and Q4 according the other) ranged from 7%
for percent energy from protein to 13% for total energy, cholesterol,
vitamin A, and riboflavin. The median proportion classified into opposite quartiles
was 10%, which is the same as what would be expected by chance. Weighted
kappas ranged from −0.03 for riboflavin to 0.14 for niacin and pantothenic
acid.

Bland-Altman plots of energy and percent energy from the three major
macronutrients show moderate agreement (Figure
2). The plots also show potential systemic bias in energy intake because
the difference between energy intake by FFQ and 24-hour diet recalls is larger among
participants with higher mean reported energy intake. However, systematic bias was
not seen in percent energy from fat, protein, or carbohydrates. Ranges for limits of
agreement were relatively wide, which indicates that there was wide variability in
how the FFQ measured macronutrient intake relative to the average of the two 24-hour
diet recalls.

Discussion
Our results indicate a moderate validity of the Tanzanian FFQ when compared
to two 24-hour diet recalls in an urban adult population in Dar es Salaam. As has
been observed in previous validation studies, we found that the FFQ generally
overestimated intake relative to the 24-hour diet recalls(25,29,42–45) and deattenuation tended to increase estimated correlation
coefficients(46). Coefficients comparing
estimated nutrient intakes from the FFQ and two 24-hour diet recalls were low to
moderate. We found that the FFQ performed best for macronutrients when quantified as
a percent of energy intake, but less well for nutrients adjusted for energy intake
using the residual method. The FFQ appeared to be a better measure of macronutrients
and minerals than vitamins. This may be because vitamin intake tends to vary greatly
from day to day (as many vitamins are only found in a small selection of foods),
whereas macronutrient intake remains relatively constant.

The validity of the FFQ to measure food group intake was also moderate.
However, we found that the FFQ has poor validity for measuring legume and nut
intake, and vegetable (both root vegetables and other vegetables) intake. The poor
validity of the FFQ for these food groups may be due to the difficulty of
quantifying the intake of foods that tend to be a component of a dish, such as
vegetables added to stews. This can be particularly challenging in Tanzania, where
vegetables are often consumed in mixed dishes along with many other vegetables, and
possibly meat or fish, rather than independently. Tanzanian meals are often composed
of a starch (i.e. rice or stiff porridge (called ugali in Swahili)) and a stew,
making it difficult for individuals to assess the quantity of each component of the
food. An additional challenge in Tanzania and elsewhere in SSA is that food is often
consumed communally, from a shared household dish rather than from individual
plates, which complicates estimating portion size, as well as portion content. To
account for this, we included “handful” (ujazo wa kiganja cha mkono
in Swahili) as a serving size option in the FFQ.

Previous FFQ validation studies have similarly found that correlations tend
to be lower for vegetables than other food groups(22,25,45,47–49). A cross-check
question on the daily number of servings of vegetable could be added to future
versions of the FFQ to help correct for over-reporting of vegetable intake(22).

Our results are similar to those from previous FFQ validations that have
been conducted in SSA. We identified four full-length FFQs that have been validated
for use in sub-Saharan African populations: a 164-item quantitative FFQ with a
recall period of 7-days was validated against 2-day weighed food records using data
from 70 participants in Mali, a 122-item FFQ was validated against four 24-hour diet
recalls using data from 79 participants in Botswana, a 145-item FFQ was validated
against a 7-day weighed food record using data from 74 participants in South Africa,
and a quantitative FFQ was validated against two 24-hour diet recalls using data
from 50 women in Tanzania (information was not provided on number of
food-items)(25,27,29,30). We found a median correlation of 0.35 for
food groups, which is comparable to median correlations of 0.28, 0.38, and 0.37 that
were found in Mali, Botswana, and SA, respectively. Our food group correlations
ranged from 0.00 to 0.51, compared to correlations ranging from −0.04 to
0.56, 0.18 to 0.58, and 0.14 to 0.56 in Mali, Botswana, and SA, respectively.

For most nutrients and food groups that we examined, we found relatively
similar population-level intakes to what has been found by other researchers in
Tanzania. Lukmanji et al. found a similar distribution of macronutrient intake in a
study of pregnant women with HIV in Dar es Salaam(33). A global study estimated that sugar-sweetened beverage intake in
Tanzanians aged 40 years and older ranged from 0.16 to 0.32 servings per day,
depending on age and sex(50). This is similar
in range to our findings of 0.2 servings per day, according to the FFQ, and 0.1
servings per day, according to the 24-hour diet recalls. However, we also observed
some intake values that differed considerably from previous studies. For example, a
global study estimated that, on average, Tanzanians consume 2.75 (95% CI:
2.45 – 3.08) grams of sodium per day,(51) which is more than double the intakes of 0.96 grams per day
estimated from our FFQ and 0.38 grams per day estimated from our 24-hour diet
recalls.

Our study had several limitations. We used two 24-hour diet recalls as our
reference method instead of several weighed food records. Our 24-hour diet recalls
may have underestimated dietary intake due to multiple factors including
under-reporting due to recall bias (e.g forgot to report snacks or small food items)
and under-representativeness of weekend diet (which is often larger than weekday
diet). Other studies have found that participants incorrectly report portion sizes
on 24-hour diet recalls(52) and a
meta-analysis of FFQ validation studies found that correlations of nutrient intake
were lower for FFQs validated against 24-hour diet recalls rather than food
records(53). However, weighed food
records may affect participants’ behavior and it is not possible to conduct
food records in populations that have low literacy levels such as ours, unless an
interviewer observes and records every meal, as was done for the FFQ validation in
Mali(25). A meta-analysis of FFQ
validation studies also found that nutrient correlations were lower when the
reference method of dietary questionnaire was conducted fewer than 8 times(53). We conducted two 24-hour diet recalls per
participant due to financial and logistic constraints. Further factors that may have
lowered the agreement and correlation between our FFQ and the reference method were
the limited training received by the study interviewers in how to conduct dietary
questionnaires (i.e. one full-day session and two days of field tests) and
questionnaire fatigue, for both participants and interviewers, due to the lengthy
questionnaires conducted prior to the dietary questionnaires. The non-dietary
DUCS-HTN questionnaire and measurements took approximately one hour to complete and
each dietary questionnaire took 30-45 minutes to complete.

Our FFQ queried participants about many individual foods. A future study
could include questions on frequency of consumption of food groups in addition to
questions on individual food items. This may help quantify whether asking about
individual foods overestimates the food group consumption. It is possible that an
FFQ that focused on the most common mixed dishes and amount and types of sauces
added to dishes, rather than asking mainly about individual food items might improve
dietary assessment in this population.

In summary, our results indicate moderate agreement between the FFQ and two
24-hour diet recalls for use in urban Tanzania. Our results could be used to inform
the creation and implementation of improved dietary questionnaires for use in SSA.
Future FFQ validation studies may wish to examine the effect of intensity of
interviewer training on FFQ validation quality. In addition, future studies might
conduct FFQ validations using more than two 24-hour diet recalls spaced out over a
longer period of time as the reference method.
