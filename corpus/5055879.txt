        Several experiments were conducted to developed orange based vinegar by surface culture. The addition of sugar (sucrose and concentrated must) and the presence/absence of peel in the raw material (squeezed juice, peeled orange, non-peeled orange plus squeezed juice) have been studied during the development of the final product. Polyphenolic and volatile characterization and sensory analysis have also been carried out. The polyphenolic and volatile content of the resulting wines and vinegars showed significant differences depending upon the raw material used. In general, the complexity of the polyphenolic and volatile profiles increased for experiments in which orange peel was included in the raw material. Sensory analysis revealed significant differences between the samples in respect of both sugar addition and raw material. The vinegars using sugar, peeled orange and non-peeled orange plus squeezed juice raw materials, had more preference and keeping in view relative efficiency of the process, vinegar made from the peeled orange material was considered to be best.
